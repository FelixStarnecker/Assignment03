0,SITC,3,2007,2007-10-28 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the Developers Diversified Realty earnings conferencecall. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to ourhost, Michelle Dawson. Please proceed, ma’am.
Michelle M. Dawson: Thank you, Lacey. Good morning, and thanks to everyone forjoining us. On today’s call, you’ll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, BillSchafer and David Oakes. Before we begin, I’d like to alert you that certain of ourstatements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that suchstatements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand thosestatements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differmaterially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertaintiesthat could cause actual results to differ may be found in our press releaseissued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and in our Form 10-K forthe year ended December 31, 2006 and filed with the SEC. I’d also like to request that callers observe a two questionlimit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chanceto participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, I’ll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott A. Wolstein: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everybody. I ampleased to report this quarter’s funds from operations of $0.80 a share. Thisfigure includes approximately $0.03 per share, or $4.2 million of aggregategains. This transactional income compares to approximately $0.15 per share or$16.8 million of gains in the same quarter of 2006. After adjusting for these items, our core FFO per shareincreased by more than 12% from the prior year. Similarly, on a nine-monthbasis after adjusting for these items, core FFO per share increased byapproximately 15% as compared to the prior year, reflecting the quality of ourportfolio and the continued strong demand for well-positioned retail space. As you will hear throughout the call, our accomplishmentsover the last three months reflect our continued focus on creating value forshareholders as follows: (1) By improving the quality of our portfolio through activeportfolio management. (2)By increasing the size and scope of our developmentpipeline. (3)By formalizing and growing our funds management business. (4) By broadening our investment strategy to include selectemerging markets with high growth profiles. (5) Strengthening our balance sheet to levels at leastcomparable to where we were prior to the Inland acquisition. These initiatives clearly leverage our core competencies andnational platform in an efficient and profitable manner that will enable us togrow long-term earnings, dividends and asset value. At this point, I’d like to turn the over to Bill Schafer forhis comments on the balance sheet.
William H. Schafer: Thank you, Scott. To add to Scott’s remarks, I’d like tohighlight a few important items from the quarter and their impact on ourfinancial position. As we indicated on our second quarter call, we soldapproximately $600 million of assets in late Q2 and early Q3, including threeredevelopment assets acquired from Inland that were sold to MDT forapproximately $50 million. The remaining assets were non-core, smaller, older assets inmore remote locations with limited growth potential and higher capital andmanagement requirements; and therefore, were sold to a third party. Thisportfolio included assets acquired from Inland as well as our existingportfolio. While the sale of these assets was slightly dilutive tocurrent FFO, the result had a significant positive impact on the quality of ourasset base, the effectiveness of our operations, and the strength of ourbalance sheet as sales proceeds were used to repay debt. We continue to operate with a conservative balance sheet andhave already returned our debt and coverage ratios to levels that existed priorto the Inland acquisition. Over the last few years, the company has grownsignificantly, providing us with considerable and stable critical mass andstrengthening our position as a leader in our industry. This growth has beenachieved without any deterioration in our balance sheet. In fact, the balancesheet is much stronger than it was a few years ago simply due to thesignificant increase in total equity. Our growth has been, and will continue to be, financedthrough various sources of capital. We’ve demonstrated this broad access tocapital through all our previous acquisitions over the last few years includingJDN, Benderson, CPG and now Inland. As our development pipeline continues togrow, having access to both public and private debt and equity capital will continueto provide the funding necessary while enabling us to maintain a solid balancesheet. We have made great strives to diversify our sources of funding and limitour reliance on any one source, especially the most costly source, commonequity. I would like to comment more specifically on our capitalposition given the recent volatility in the debt markets. During the last fewmonths, spreads have increased to levels higher than I can remember. In fact,there was a period of time in which certain CMBS financings may not have beenavailable at any price. This uncertainty reemphasizes the need to access diversesources of capital, maintain liquidity and stage debt maturities carefully.Most significantly, it underscores the importance of a conservative balancesheet that provides flexibility and access in capital and enhances our abilityto manage assets with limited restrictions. This position consequently allowsus to be opportunistic in our investment strategy and in accessing the mostefficient and lowest cost of financing available. With regard to debt maturities, I believe we are in a strongposition that will help insulate us from continued volatility. On our balancesheet, we’ve addressed all remaining 2007 maturities, which aggregate less than$10 million. Our 2008 aggregate maturities are less than $400 million,approximately 75% of which relates to mortgage debt. We’ve also made sure our liquidity continues to be strong.At September 30, 2007 wehad over $600 million available on revolving credit facilities. In addition, weexpect to increase our secured term loan facility through our accordion featureby over $100 million within the next few months to incorporate certain Inlandassets that are already subject to low loan-to-value first mortgage loans. Thiscapacity, combined with our retained cash flow and additional asset sales, willprovide us with flexibility in funding our development pipeline and otherinvestment opportunities. With regard to joint venture debt maturities, I also believewe are in a good position. The remaining $85 million in debt that matures in2007 is already being extended. I’d also like to emphasize that over half ofthe $600 million in 2008 debt maturities are not scheduled to mature untilDecember of 2008 and more than half of the remaining 2008 maturities haveextension options available. I believe we have effectively mitigated our refinancingrisks and maximized our flexibility. Our banking relationships, which are broadand competitive, will reduce the impact of volatility in capital markets, andwe have taken proactive steps to maintain and improve the strength of ourbalance sheet in recent quarters. We will continue to do this in the future. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Bill and good morning. The third quarter wasanother successful quarter for our leasing and development teams. Strongoccupancy and leased rates, continued rental growth with modest capitalexpenditure, and record volume of leasing have all been a function of ourcontinued focus on improving the quality of our portfolio through active assetmanagement and a consistent demand from tenants, which we continue to seeacross our portfolio. Of particular note this quarter, our leasing team had arecord quarter in terms of number of deals signed, volume of space leased, andrental spreads on new leases. Specifically, there were 179 new leases signedrepresenting over 940,000 square feet of GLA with an average spread on a cashbasis of over 41%. As mentioned, the 41% spread on new leases is the highestlevel we’ve achieved within our portfolio. This impressive figure was driven bymany deals at many different locations across the country, but a few highlightsinclude: in Amherst, New York we had added a 15,000 square foot EasternMountain Sports where the former tenant was paying a $1.55 a foot and the newrent was $21 a foot; in Monaca, Pennsylvania we added Office Depot and CircuitCity to re-tenant a former Shop ‘n Save Supermarket where the old rent was$3.80, with the new rent being $12.95; and in Chester, Virginia, we had aformer Rite Aid that was paying us $3.23 on 15,500 square feet thatwas replaced with a Petco with a new rent of $15. We also executed 299 renewal leases comprising 1.6 millionsquare feet of GLA at an average spread of 7.4%. In total, our leasing teamsexecuted 478 leases aggregating 2.5 million square feet of GLA at an averagespread of 13.8%. The 478 leases signed and the 2.5 million square feet of GLAare record highs for our leasing department. Our leasing team has consistently performed at a very highlevel, and this quarter is obviously no exception. The record leasing activitythis quarter is a testament to the hard work of our leasing professionals inthe various support departments with whom they work within our company.  I’m justifiably proud of what they have allachieved this quarter. We’ve all seen the headlines recently lamenting the plightof sub-prime borrowers and the general troubles in the housing market, and howthis has the potential to impact overall consumer spending and the retailindustry in the midst of the current economic turbulence. The reality is thatour portfolio is well insulated from this uncertainty and has consistentlyperformed well throughout many economic cycles. Broadly speaking, national retail sales have grown veryconsistently since World War II including during several recessions and housingslowdowns, a fact that we believe is missed in most press coverage of thecurrent environment. More specifically, over the last seven years, we’ve hadover 20 quarters of overall leasing spreads in excess of 11%. Similarly, we’vehad very little volatility in our long-term portfolio lease rate, which hasremained at approximately 96%. Moreover, we’ve been able to consistently achieve these resultswithout significant capital investment in tenant improvements or leasingcommissions. While tenants may come and go over time, shopping centers that arewell located and actively managed will continue to perform well. Clearly, we are very conscious of and sensitive to the risksposed by the current economy. But we feel comfortable with where our portfoliois positioned and the general diversity and credit quality of our tenant base. On the development front, I’m pleased to report that wecontinue to find opportunities in under-served regions. The shakeup in debt marketshas clearly impacted lower-tiered developers to the benefit of larger ones andas a result, we are rapidly seeing more opportunities and less competition. Due to these current conditions, we have increased ourinvestment in development where spreads between development yields andacquisition pricing still reflect prime opportunities to create value. Ourdevelopment pipeline has grown considerably from $3.5 billion in the thirdquarter of ‘06 to over $4 billion today. Total construction in process hasincreased from $450 million in the third quarter of ‘06 to over $600 million inthis quarter. As a result of this ramp up in our development pipeline, we areanticipating record deliveries in 2009 and 2010. In addition to our robust domestic pipeline, we have alsoincreased our presence in faster growing economies through investments indevelopment projects in Brazil,Canada and Russia.We have pursued investments in these markets in a prudent and strategic manner,allocating a nominal amount of capital to these markets relative to our totaldomestic asset base. Of particular note this quarter, we entered Canadathrough a 50% joint venture with Rice Construction, a strong Toronto-based developer.The joint venture’s first development project will be a 74-acre mixed-useproject, comprised of approximately 700,000 square feet oflifestyle, retail, office and residential uses in suburban Toronto.The estimated cost of the project is expected to be approximately $150 millionCanadian, with construction expected to begin in spring of 2009 and retailtenants opening as early as fall of 2011. We are pleased to be able to enter the market in this mannerbecause the opportunity presents a very attractive development project in amarket with strong demographics and considerable supply constraints due torecent greenbelt regulations that permanently restrict new development in areassurrounding the Toronto MSA. This is an exciting opportunity to control one of thelimited remaining large parcels of developable land in this rapidly growing andnearby market. We look forward to finding additional attractive investmentopportunities to increase our presence in Canada.There was a presentation on our website that illustrates the many reasons whywe believe this is an attractive investment. In addition to the myriad of leasing and developmentinitiatives that were ongoing throughout the quarter, we also completed a verysuccessful company-wide portfolio review. At this two-week annual event, morethan 100 departmental representatives, alongside Scott, David, Bill, and myselfevaluated each asset’s strategic position within our portfolio, identifyingopportunities and challenges based on the assets’ performance and competitivemarket positions. This comprehensive asset management exercise resulted inover 300 action items to improve portfolio performance, pursue opportunities tocreate value, and generate better shopping venues for our tenants and consumers.Importantly, the portfolio review identified additional assets to consider fordisposition as well, continuing our capital recycling initiative. This quarter was a very active and successful quarter forour company on many fronts. Our leasing department produced record results. Ourdevelopment pipeline expanded. Our international footprint increased throughour joint venture in Canadaand finally, we completed a very important asset management review of ourportfolio, which will help us add additional value going forward. We look forward to building on these successes andmaintaining the positive momentum that we clearly enjoy in the current market. Withthat, I will turn the call over to David.
David J. Oakes: During the quarter, we continued to sharpen our capitalallocation strategy, further implementing the relative value framework,executing key transactions, and broadening the scope of opportunities that weare evaluating. For example, we completed the sale of three value-addedredevelopment assets to Macquarie DDR Trust. Our current portfolio has aconsiderable number of potential redevelopments on which we expect to executeand we were happy to find a partner whose refined investment strategy lined upideally to participate with us. This preserves our capital, while alsogenerating attractive returns for us and our partner. Further, these propertysales and the accompanying list of assets to which we gave MDT a right of firstoffer underscore our long-term commitment to this relationship. We also continue to formalize our funds management business,which includes our long-term relationship with MDT as well as Teachers TIAA,the investors in our first commingled fund, as well as many others. Our jointventure program has historically generated significant returns for both us andour partners, and we recognize that continuing to operate with the sameperformance-driven philosophy is crucial to our growth in this arena. While there may be some softening in the demand and pricingfor lower quality assets, we continue to see strong investment demand from ourinstitutional clients for well-positioned properties with a visible growthprofile. We also continue to see very intense demand for our platform andexpect to see our assets under management increase in the coming years, and weare staffing the department appropriately to ensure its success. Also during the quarter, we repurchased more than $100million of our stock at prices that we believe represented a material discountto the value of our assets. Now, I will turn the call back to Scott for his concludingremarks.
Scott A. Wolstein: Thanks, David. The strategies and achievements we’vehighlighted during the last few minutes are initiatives you’ve been hearing ustalk about for several quarters: improving the overall quality of our portfoliothrough disposition, development and acquisition; returning the balance sheetto levels comparable to or better than where we were prior to our Inlandacquisition; increasing our investment in development where our capital canearn the highest return; selectively investing a reasonable amount of capitalin international markets that offer superior growth and outstanding valuecreation opportunities; and investing in our stock at prices many cents belowthe value of our assets. As we look to the coming year, we’re refining our strategyto focus on further upgrading our portfolio through active portfoliomanagement, including redevelopments and dispositions, which will have along-term positive impact on our internal growth and cash flow; improving thequality of our FFO; growing our funds management business through execution forexisting partners, and by adding new clients; using the current dislocation inthe credit market to our advantage by finding broken developments orredevelopments or other unique investment opportunities created by the dramaticchange in liquidity and the repricing of the risk; deepening our domesticdevelopment pipeline and broadening our international investments. Based on this activity, we expect FFO per share for 2008 tobe in the range of $3.95 to $4.05. The key assumptions that drive this guidanceare as follows: same-store NOI growth of 2% to 2.5%, which is in line with 2007and driven by consistent leasing spreads and stable occupancy; anticipateddisposition of additional non-core assets; and a consistent level oftransactional income. In addition, 2008 development deliveries will be well belowthe 2007 level and well below our expectations for 2009 and beyond. There is noparticular driver for this other than the projected timing of completions. Infact, we expect 2009 to be by far the strongest level of development deliveriesin the company’s history by a rather wide margin. We acknowledge that this FFO growth is slightly lower thanour historic norms, but we believe that the constitution of 2008 FFO will behigher quality and we would expect our FFO growth to accelerate dramatically in2009 and beyond. The strategies and assumptions I just mentioned reflect the constantand strategic evolution of our business model as we continually strive tocreate value and enhance returns for our shareholders and clients. We arelooking forward to putting these strategies to work at all levels throughoutour organization. With that, I would like to open the phone lines for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Ambika Goel - Citi.
Ambika Goel: Can you comment on the level of transaction volume that’sembedded in 2008 guidance? Is it specific deals that you have already set upthat you expect to occur? Given that the level of transaction activity in 2007was quite high, I just wanted to see what got you comfortable with 2008 levels.
David J. Oakes: We expect, at this point, the transaction volume in 2008 tobe lower than the record volume in 2007. We’ve budgeted some expected assetsales, continuing to recycle capital and work on the assets that Dan mentionedspecifically that came out of the portfolio reviews that might be good candidatesfor sale and do not have acquisitions identified at this point. So our budgetcurrently is to be a net seller of real estate for 2008.
Ambika Goel: Specifically focusing on the gains, do you have deals inplace that make you comfortable with transactional profits to be in line withthe previous year?
David J. Oakes: We are comfortable with our guidance that transactionalgains would be consistent with or somewhat lower than the level of 2007 thatsupport the range that Scott provided.
Scott A. Wolstein: Ambika, most of that is merchant building gains based onactual development completions that already exist, which will probably beconveyed into joint ventures with financial partners, as we’ve done in pastyears. So yes, we’ve identified actual properties, the yields on thoseproperties are already in place. We pretty much know what the cap rates wouldbe on any sale or contribution to a joint venture.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: Good morning, everyone. On the ‘08 guidance, calling for 5%,6% growth year over year which again looks reasonable, but a bit of adeceleration. Can you just comment to what degree being a net seller next year,what sort of dilution you’re expecting there? To what degree will you be a netseller in 2008?
David J. Oakes: Right now, for the budget we are expecting to be a netseller of several hundred million dollars of real estate in 2008.
Jay Habermann -Goldman Sachs: Can you just characterize the pipeline of acquisitions thatyou’re actually looking at today?
David J. Oakes: I would say despite the slowdown a few months ago, therecontinues to be a healthy amount of products on the market and we continue toevaluate a very large number of acquisition opportunities across the spectrumof retail that are available today.
Scott A. Wolstein: Jay, just to elaborate on that a little bit, I think whatyou’re seeing in the marketplace today is we are seeing an acceleration ofportfolio opportunities, largely from private developers who are facing aliquidity crunch. The conundrum is, of course, that our cost of capital is hightoday as well, and the core co-investors that we typically invest with arelittle bit nervous about going heavily into core at low cap rates because ofrisk in terms of potential inflation of cap rates. So, it’s going to be aninteresting year to see how all that plays out. There are going to be a lot of assets in play. We’recertainly not going to be issuing equity to buy those assets. We would investin core, as we said in many prior conference calls, only in a joint venturewith private capital. Our ability to execute on those transactions will belargely dictated by whether private capital has an appetite to buy core assets inthis environment. Right now I think it’s a little unclear and that’s why wehaven’t included any of that in our guidance.
Jay Habermann -Goldman Sachs: Can you just talk about the decision to enter Canadaand obviously go with a joint venture with Rice and pursue mixed-use? Just talkabout the expected returns there?
David J. Oakes: I think the decision to enter Canadawas a recognition that while we see the greatest opportunity and the greatestneed around the world for new development in some of the emerging markets thatare meaningfully underserved for retail space, that there are also someopportunities closer to home. The reality is, Torontois closer to our headquarters here in Cleveland and three-quarters of the restof our portfolio. I think it was a natural extension in many ways. The project overall is a mixed-use project. However, the netcost of roughly $150 million that we’ve outlined -- so the great majority ofthe overall budget -- relate to the retail section of about 700,000 square feet oflifestyle space. Demographics of this particular site are extremely attractive,and also the greater comfort that we feel, especially due to new supplyconstraints in the Toronto market. So,we feel like those sides of it line up very well in addition to having found apartner that we feel extremely good about. I think we would continue to look for those sort ofopportunities in all the markets in which we operate, but particularly in andaround Toronto.
Jay Habermann -Goldman Sachs: Is this a one-off transaction or do you expect to pursueadditional projects with Rice?
David J. Oakes: This is a one-off transaction, but we’ve had a very positiveexperience with the Rice Group so far and would be very open to working withthem on additional projects. They have additional land bank in and around Toronto,and I think that’s a conversation that we are very willing to have.
Jay Habermann -Goldman Sachs: Dan, any pullback from retailers in terms of the developmentbusiness?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We’re not seeing a real pullback from retailers from adesire to open new stores. What we are seeing is retailers are using thecurrent economic climate as an opportunity to renegotiate or at the very least,poor mouth a little bit the deals that we’re working on with them. Retailershave gotten a little tougher. I think they are trying to grab back some of thepricing power that we’ve enjoyed over the last four or five years. Sometimesthat works for them, sometimes it doesn’t. One of the beauties of our business right now is thatthere’s still a lot of competition for space. So if you have a desirablelocation and you can generate competition and an auction for the space, you’restill able to get your price. So even though they’re getting tougher, the dealsare getting a little tougher, but there are other parts of the developmentbusiness that are getting a little less tough. One of the things that we are seeing is a little lesscompetition for land. One of the things that has been driving costs up andmargins down a little bit in development is land costs. With some of thedislocation in the capital markets, we’re starting to see that lighten up alittle bit which should give us the opportunity to recapture some of themargin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christeen Kim -Deutsche Bank.
Christeen Kim -Deutsche Bank: Scott, you’d talked a little bit about how investors arefeeling a little bit more nervous about getting involved in these largerportfolio acquisitions. Is there any price differentiation between thedifferent asset classes; A quality product versus B?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. Imean, there’s always been a clear differentiation among institutional investorsbetween A and B quality assets. There’s never been a broad institutional bidfor B quality assets unless they had a value-added component to them wherethere was an opportunity to create A assets out of a B asset and have a greatopportunity for value creation. I think today, the appetite among institutional investors isclearly more towards the value add than core, to protect themselves frompossible changes in pricing. I haven’t seen it necessarily translate intotransactions being priced at lower prices yet on A assets. I haven’t seen thatand I don’t know if we will. But there certainly is a less voluminous demandfrom the capital side to invest in blind pools to go out and acquire core assets,if you will, vis-à-vis value-added opportunities.
Christeen Kim -Deutsche Bank: Does that imply that you haven’t seen much movement in caprates then?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We haven’t seen it yet. But what I am saying is thereclearly is some concern that might happen, and that has an impact on the depthof demand on the institutional private equity front.
David J. Oakes: I think also in terms of the institutional demand for realestate at this point, we’ve clearly gone through a great period of uncertainty.The reason that we have such great interest in working with us and our platformin general is because we are able to go out there and take some of the risk outof these opportunities, and that’s what a large portion of the core investoruniverse wants. I think in the uncertainty we’ve seen in the market in the pastfew months, it just causes this slowdown in activity as everyone somewhat waitsto see where it settles out. I think another aspect is just a calendar issue, in terms ofthis time of year you either get to a point where institutions have put out thecapital they need to for the year, in which case they are focused on ‘08planning, or they haven’t and they’re fighting for deals to close in these lastcouple of months. As it stands today, given the incredible record volume oftransactions across all property types in the first half of 2007, I think manyinstitutions are simply done with the allocation that they needed to invest for2007. And are making their plans for the best ways to put out capital in 2008and very actively having those conversations with us and others about whatopportunities we are seeing to invest more capital.
Christeen Kim -Deutsche Bank: Just quickly on the ‘08 NOI growth guidance, given how muchportfolio re-positioning you have done this year, why isn’t that range a littlebit higher?
Scott A. Wolstein: You are talking about the same-store NOI growth?
Christeen Kim -Deutsche Bank: Yes.
Scott A. Wolstein: It really takes time for that to resonate. I mean, a lot ofour assets are new developments either that we built or that we acquired. Leasesdon’t roll every year. They roll every three to five years. I think you will beseeing that in the coming years. There’s no question about it. There’s also alittle bit of -- to be quite candid with you -- our budgets come from ourleasing people. They have to perform as they guide us to what will happen atthe portfolio level. We certainly hope that they will do better than what theyproject. They are not likely to give us forecasts that are major stretch fromwhat they think they can achieve. So oftentimes we do better than what we guideto at this point in time.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I also think one of the things to consider along the leasingbudgeting that Scott mentioned is that we were more conservative for 2008primarily because we have an economy that people are concerned about. So, wethink it would’ve been imprudent for us to be overly aggressive in 2008. So wedid go through the portfolio and we did make some projections on some tenantsthat we may have had concerns with. If it proves out that the economy is betterthan people think and the world actually isn’t coming to an end, we hopefullywill be in a position to outperform.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller - JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: Dan, going back to the question about tenant demand in thedevelopment pipeline, when we look out at the ‘08, ‘09 pipeline, can you giveus a sense as to what’s under letter of intent? What’s pre-leased? If theeconomy softens further and -- I don’t want to say it’s going into recession,but gets a little bit weaker -- what should we think of as being at risk? Or isthe visibility high enough where you’re not necessarily worrying about that?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, the visibility is pretty high so we are not overlyconcerned about it. If we are buying land out there, Michael, which is theultimate in exposure to a development project, we have a very, very goodunderstanding of the majority of the tenants that are going to be on that site.We may not have every lease signed or even every letter of intent signed, butwe clearly have visibility as to who the tenants are; and in some cases, thetenants sent us to those markets, so that makes it even easier from thatperspective. We know who the supporting cast will be around those tenants. When you talk about ‘09, for example, and in particular ‘10,which is we have a number of deals also that we’re working for ‘10, it a littleearly to be pre-leasing those sites other than the actual anchors. So we havegreat visibility on our anchor interest and we have a lot of confidence on whothe followers are after you secure those anchors. If we don’t, to be honestwith you, we won’t close on the land. If we don’t have a good feel for what wecan do there based on the marketing that’s currently going on within ourdevelopment or leasing departments, we will pass on the site. We do that on aregular basis. There are times when we had projects that tenants just won’tcommit to at this time or they feel that the market is too green, or in somecases, the housing projection seem unrealistic from a development perspective,particularly in the current climate. If that’s the case, then we move on. The good news is that the pipeline is very, very full andprobably even exceeds our capacity if it all were to hit. So therefore, we continueto work the ones that are most profitable and where we have the most tenantinterest. We’ve never really done a project, quite frankly, where it’s beenbuilt that we haven’t been able to lease it. I don’t see any change in that.
Michael Mueller: When you talk about the pipeline getting bigger in ’09 and‘10, should we think of that as popping or running at a higher level? You are hittingyour stride and that seems to be a good number for the foreseeable future?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, it’s going to continue to accelerate. As Scottmentioned, ‘08 on deliveries is going to be lighter than ‘07, but ‘09 will be aconsiderable acceleration and ‘10 should be as well.
Michael Mueller: You did some stuff with MDT; is their access to capitalbetter these days?
David J. Oakes: You can see where the stock trades on the AFX and where thereported MTA of the company is. Clearly there is a relatively meaningful spreadthere that I think they have to evaluate if they are thinking about equitycapital. Overall, our view is that their balance sheet continues to be in verystrong shape. I think they clearly have access to capital, but I think ingeneral that question is much better posed to Nick Ridgewell and the MDT team.
William H. Schafer: I’d like to lever in a little bit on what Dan was talkingabout with respect to our development pipeline. I think it’s important to notethat when we are talking about 2009 deliveries, that’s typically a projectthat’s been in the pipeline now since 2006. The gestation period for ourprojects at this point tends to be about three years. So by the time we’resitting here at the end of 2007, we have a very good idea of the anchor lineupfor all of those properties and probably have letters of intent with theanchors in most of them. That is different from the way it used to be where we usedto have a year to year-and-a-half gestation period. The leasing was going on aswe were going through the entitlement process. At this point in time, sometimesthe leasing is actually preceding the entitlement process and gets donequicker. So we have a much higher visibility on leasing than we do onentitlements in many places. The other thing relates to your other question about whetherthe increase in volume in 2009 is indicative of a trend. It very clearly is forno other reason than we broadened our universe of opportunities by addinginternational development deals to the mix. We have several deals in thepipeline in Brazil.As David mentioned, we have one in Canadaand others that we’ll look at beyond that. We have a few deals in Russiaqueued up as well. So the development pipeline going forward quite naturally isgoing to become larger just because it’s a greater universe that we are dealingin.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ostrower -Morgan Stanley.
Matt Ostrower -Morgan Stanley: I may have missed it, but just looking at your guidance, itlooks like the midpoint is in the 5% range, 4% to 5%. If I look at yoursame-store NOI growth we’re talking about 2%, 2.5% growth there; lever that upto the 4%, 5% growth level. Transactional income is flat but then gains godown. Doesn’t that get you below the mid-point of your guidance? What’s theoffset there? If you already answered this question, I apologize.
Scott A. Wolstein: Matt, we did answer it, I think. That is, that we are a netseller which is dilutive to earnings. So while we have a same-store NOI growthin the core assets that continues to be held in core, the amount of the coreassets in the core will decrease under our guidance.
Matt Ostrower -Morgan Stanley: Right. I’m actually wondering, the guidance is a little highto me given that you will be a net seller and that your development gains aregoing down. Why would you still be in the mid single-digit range guidance-wise?Why wouldn’t you be lower than that under that base case scenario?
William H. Schafer: Well, that’s a very difficult question to answer on aconference call. There are so many things that go into the budget. You’ve justgot to trust us that in all the moving parts, this is where it comes out.
David J. Oakes: Mid-point this year to mid-point next year of 5.5% growth, Ithink, based on the assumptions we’ve outlined is a level that we’re verycomfortable with.
Matt Ostrower -Morgan Stanley: You guys disclosed your capitalized G&A. You’ve talkedabout, I think, it is $8 million to-date of Construction Associates. Are theremore administrative costs that you capitalize there, senior management andother stuff that’s in there or is that really your full capitalized G&A?
Scott A. Wolstein: That is really the full capitalized G&A. There is notsenior executive capitalization in there. It’s basically the development andrelated leasing activities that are associated with development that are prettymuch capitalized there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Miller - JMGCapital.
Jeff Miller: What’s your liquidity at this point? You mentioned, I think,over $600 million?
Scott A. Wolstein: Yes. At the end of the quarter, we had over $600 millionavailable on our lines. There’s not a whole lot of re-financings that we havefor the balance of the year. I think there’s $100 million of notes that comesdue in the first quarter of next year and we continue to evaluate options on adaily basis.
Jeff Miller: You said of that just under $400 million in ‘08 coming due,maturing, most are mortgages, mortgage debt and half had extension optionsavailable?
Scott A. Wolstein: I think that was with regard to the joint ventures as towhere we had half of the joint venture maturities of about $600 million were inDecember of ‘08. The remaining half of that, more than half of it was subjectto extension options.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it’s important for you to know that all of the jointventure debt is project debt. There’s no unsecured corporate debt. There are nocorporate guarantees on any of the joint venture debt.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore - RBC CapitalMarkets.
Rich Moore: Dan, you sound a little bit hoarse. I assume that’s fromrooting for the Indians, or at least I hope that’s the case. I’m curious a little bit about the dynamics of the merchantbuilding sales. When you guys complete these projects, everybody knows you areready to sell. So in this tougher environment for pricing, does it pressure theselling process just to put more pressure on the pricing? If so, might you pullback on some of the actual sales and put the product inside the portfoliorather than sell it?
David J. Oakes: I think from our perspective, we’re focused on doing theright thing with the asset. It’s a strategy decision in terms of where we wantour capital allocated. The merchant building program has worked well becausebrand new, high quality assets fit exactly what some institutions are lookingfor, for that relatively low growth, almost no CapEx profile of very visiblecash flows over the coming years. To the extent that pricing for some reason that weabsolutely have not seen today would not make selling those assets acceptable. Ithink the reason we were in the development projects from the beginning is thatwe had an interest in owning them. So if the pricing for some unforeseen reasonis not there, I think there’s absolutely a willingness to own it and not justtry to push our quality product out the door at prices that we don’t feelcomfortable with.
Rich Moore: Dave, you don’t think there’s any reason to think we’d seelower margins on sales in 2008 than we’ve seen previously?
David J. Oakes: I don’t think so. The pro forma for the project get us torelatively comparable returns and cap rates are in a relatively comparablerange. Generally, we would be in the same range. We sold some very high qualityassets in this year and I think we would think about doing the same next yearand so could expect margins to be comparable.
Rich Moore: I’m curious as well guys, how the stock buyback is workingfor you? You bought back $100 million worth of stock. You have another, Ithink, $400 million you could buy back. Is that still an attractive option, doyou think? Or is that sort of meaningless at the current share prices? How areyou thinking about that?
David J. Oakes: I absolutely don’t think it’s meaningless. The boardauthorized a $500 million repurchase. The balance sheet is in a strong positionwhere we could comfortably execute on that based on all the opportunities weare seeing, that was the best opportunity to buy the stock at a big discount tonet asset value. With the exception of our blackout periods, I think it issomething we absolutely consider very, very regularly.
Rich Moore: So we can anticipate probably more buybacks in the comingmonths?
David J. Oakes: You can anticipate that it’s something we’re going to thinkabout every day.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green StreetAdvisors.
Jim Sullivan: Can you give an update on Nampa, Idaho and your bigger development projects?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: J.C. Penney opened in Nampaand is doing extremely well. We’re under construction with the lifestyle phaseof the project, and we’ll have store openings in ‘08 on that portion. We’re inactive negotiations with another department store for a second anchor on the site.
Jim Sullivan: What kind of pre-leasing do you have on what you’reconstructing?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We’re about at 40% to 45%; not executed leases, but strongindications of interest and letters of intent.
Jim Sullivan: Following up on a question raised earlier, can you commenton the pre-leasing for your overall development pipeline at this point?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, like I mentioned earlier, our pre-leasing is focusedon the anchors because once you have the anchors committed, the other tenantsusually follow if you have the right merchandise mix. We have yet to have aproblem with a project where we had anchors committed where we couldn’t leasethe additional GLA. So that being said, if we are proceeding with the project,you can be very comfortable with the fact that our anchors are committed andthat we’re very comfortable that we can lease the rest of it up. One of the things that I’d mentioned on past calls, one ofthe mistakes that we’ve made in our development pipeline overall is in somecases bowing to market pressure to pre-lease at a high level too early, whereyou leave money on the table because a project that’s coming on the groundleases a lot better than a project off a piece of paper. So, we gauge thatinterest from tenants. We have a dialog with these tenants every day. Weunderstand what their expectations are from a co-tenancy perspective and we goget it when it’s the appropriate time to do so. But overall, you should keep inmind our portfolio is 96% leased, and overall, we’ve opened up our developmentprojects, in many cases, mostly in the mid to high 90s, unless we’ve made aconscious effort not to because we felt that the space would be higher valueafter the project has some operating history.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. Thisconcludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."
1,SITC,4,2007,2008-02-13 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the Developers Diversified fourth quarter earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Michelle Dawson.  You may proceed.
Michelle M. Dawson: Good morning and thanks for joining us.  On today’s call you’ll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, Bill Schafer and David Oakes. Before we begin I would like to alert you that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking.  Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 and filed with the SEC. I’d also like to request that callers observe a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate.  If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time I’ll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott A. Wolstein: Good morning, everybody.  I am pleased to report this quarter’s operating results and FFO of $0.82 per share.  I’d like to note that while this amount is comparable to our fourth quarter 2006 results, this year’s results include less transactional income and less non-recurring items such as lease terminations. After adjusting for transactional items and other income in each comparable quarter, our FFO per share actually increased by 12%.  After adjusting for these items on an annual basis, our 2007 FFO per share increased nearly 13% for the full year of 2007 as compared to 2006. Our activities in 2007 were highlighted by the successful acquisition, financing and integration of the Inland portfolio.  In light of the current dislocation in the capital markets, I think it would be helpful to remind everybody just how quickly, conservatively and efficiently we financed this major transaction. Consistent with our other large acquisitions, JDN and Benderson in Puerto Rico, our top priority was to secure permanent financing using to service levels of long-term debt and equity. Of the $6.2 billion in financing necessary to complete the Inland acquisition, we put $4.4 billion of permanent financing in place immediately at closing and completed the remaining $1.8 billion of permanent financing before the end of the second quarter. These sources included the following: $1.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock, including $400 million of common stock at nearly $70 a share issued to the former Inland shareholders. $3 billion in proceeds from the creation of a long-term, closed-end fund with TIAA. $1.5 billion in proceeds from the creation of a long-term closed end [inaudible] fund. $625 million in proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. $160 million in proceeds from the creation of a long-term joint venture with Dividend Capital’s Total Realty Trust. $600 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. The financing of this transaction was completed swiftly and was done in a very conservative manner, consistent with our preoccupation with maintaining financial flexibility and in total it actually improved our credit quality and balance sheet metrics. Before I turn the call over to Bill Schafer, I’d like to share a few thoughts about how we are positioned relative to the current disruption in the capital markets and the deceleration in the national economy.  The market is clearly skittish in the face of uncertainty and we understand the concerns regarding the lack of liquidity in the credit markets.  We are monitoring the situation very closely.  We’ve been through tough liquidity crises before and in each case we prudently capitalized on the opportunities presented by the dislocation and emerged a stronger, more profitable company. We’ve consistently operated with a philosophy to maintain broad and diverse financial relationships which in turn have provided us with considerable financial flexibility.  We are similarly well-positioned now; well-prepared and appropriately financed for this environment. Likewise, as you’ll hear from our management team, we’ve made appropriate adjustments to our investment in capital strategies.  We are being far more selective in our investment strategy and we will operate with a view towards conserving capital and positioning ourselves to take advantage of very special opportunities as they arise. To give you a sense of what we’re hearing from the retailers, I just returned from an ICSC board meeting where I heard from a number of our core retailers that new store expansion will continue virtually unabated for nearly all major tenants, although some new stores originally targeted for 2008 will be pushed to 2009 as several retailers also try to conserve capital or as many private developers fail to deliver their projects on time. The only area where tenants have markedly slowed their expansion is in women’s ready-to-wear, the impact of which will be felt primarily by regional malls and proposed lifestyle centers.  By contrast, the value retailers seem very bullish about their prospects. In summary, we’ve seen our portfolio weather difficult economic cycles in the past with stable and consistent cash flows.  Fundamentals of our business are strong.  Although we’re very focused on the current challenges in the capital markets, we have not seen a meaningful loss of jobs in the economy nor have we seen a meaningful drop in disposable income.  While a recession is certainly a possibility, early indications suggest that we will not see a precipitous drop in disposable income and retail sales will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate. As you’ll hear throughout the rest of the call, we’re actively addressing the risks and challenges presented in the current operating environment.  You will also hear how in some cases, the market dislocation can create investment opportunities that are more attractive than any that we have seen in years. With that, I’ll the turn the call over to Bill Schafer.
William H. Schafer: Thanks, Scott.  As Scott described, in light of the issues associated with the financial markets and economy, we’re focused on identifying any signs of weakness within our operations and tenant base.  For example, we noted the operating margin of our consolidated portfolio declined slightly during the quarter.  As is consistent with prior year results, our fourth quarter operating margin was lower due to the increased level of operating expenses as compared to the first three quarters of 2007. We have also been tracking changes in bad debt expense, particularly with regard to some of the smaller local tenants in our centers.  During the second half of 2007, bad debt expense increased to over 1.25% of total revenues compared to our typical rate of less than 1%.  While this increased bad debt has a nominal adverse effect on our operating margins we are not seeing any increase associated with our core tenants.  In fact, the credit quality of tenants in our portfolio is second to none. As detailed in our financial supplement, our top ten tenants represent nearly 20% of base rental revenue and 27% of gross leasable area.  The majority of these tenants are investment grade rated.  Wal-Mart is our largest tenant and represents about 4.5% of total base rental revenue and 7% of owned GLA; no other tenant represents more than 2% of base rental revenues. Other top ten tenants include Lowe’s Home Improvement, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, Kohl’s, PetsMart, Bed Bath and Beyond, Target, Tops Markets and Kroger’s to name a few. Notably, local tenants occupy less than 6% of our gross leasable area and comprise just over 10% of total revenues, including our pro rata share of joint ventures. While these local tenants may lack financial transparency, we note that many operate in some of the least cyclical portions of retail. I would also like to note that during the fourth quarter of 2007 we incurred approximately $2.3 million of other expense on a net basis.  This expense included, among other items, nearly $1.4 million of abandoned development costs and approximately $1 million in professional fees and formation costs associated with the establishment of our joint venture with ECE for shopping center development in Russia and Ukraine. Offsetting the impact of these expenses was a tax benefit of approximately $2.5 million that was recognized in our joint venture with Sonae Sierra; the $2.5 million represents our share of the benefit.  This benefit is related to the determination that certain tax loss carryforwards would be available for use in future periods.  This conclusion is the result of recent organizational restructuring in our joint venture and increased profitability of our largest shopping center in Brazil, Park Don Pedro.  As a result, the joint venture reversed the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Now I’d like to share my thoughts on our balance sheet position, debt maturities and opportunities in the capital markets.  As I have said many times, we operate with a conservative balance sheet and are focused on maintaining our investment grade ratings.  As Scott described, we entered into each of the significant transactions that have occurred over the past several years with a financing plan that was long term and leverage neutral and more importantly, execution that was completed within an extremely short period of time. In uncertain economic times such as these, it’s extremely important to have access to numerous types of debt and equity capital and as a result of our long-term capital markets philosophy, we have positioned ourselves appropriately to access attractively priced capital. In addition to establishing solid relationships with institutional equity investors which you’ll hear more about from David, the relationships that we have established with many large lending institutions over the years are also critically important.  These relationships enabled us to increase capacity by over $300 million on our term loan and revolving credit facilities at existing terms and fees consistent with historical averages in what I will refer to as a challenging market. In December, we increased the capacity on our secured term loan by $250 million.  The secured term loan is now at $800 million priced at LIBOR plus 70 basis points and expires in 2012 after taking into account the extension option available in the facility at our option.  This term loan is secured by assets that are already encumbered by existing first mortgages at low loan to values. Also at that time we increased our unsecured revolving credit facilities by $65 million and modified certain covenants to provide greater financial flexibility.  Our revolving credit facilities are priced at LIBOR plus 60 basis points and mature in 2011 after taking into account the extension option. With regard to our 2008 maturities and our refinancing plans in this market, we began addressing these maturities last year and as a result they represent a very manageable amount.  In 2008, we have $400 million of consolidated debt maturing and $650 million in joint venture debt maturing, of which our share was $110 million. During the first quarter of 2008, we executed a term sheet and entered into an interest rate lock on a portfolio of six assets, including three that are currently encumbered with mortgages scheduled to mature during the next few months.  Proceeds from this financing will be $350 million with a fixed interest coupon rate of 5% at 55% loan to value and a five-year maturity.  This funding will refinance substantially all of our consolidated 2008 maturities. The weighted average interest expense associated with consolidated debt maturing in 2008 is 5.7%.  The approximate loan to value on the mortgage debt of approximately $300 million is 35%.  Based upon the $350 million refinancing in progress, the difference in rate after taking into account all costs will be accretive. In addition, LIBOR averaged around 5.25% during 2007 while current rates are over 200 basis points lower.  Although we initially assumed a 50 to 75 basis point LIBOR rate reduction in 2008 versus 2007, we did not budget a 200 basis point reduction. If LIBOR rates remain where they are, our interest savings as compared to our initial budget would approximate over $7 million, which is expected to more than cover potential increases in bad debt expense. We’re addressing our 2008 joint venture maturities in a similar manner.  Our Conventry II joint venture recently extended $117 million loan on a portfolio of former service merchandise properties.  This loan was extended to 2009 and has two additional one-year extensions available at our option. Another joint venture with Prudential real estate investors is in the process of refinancing $72 million in mortgage debt with the existing lender at LIBOR plus 1.25%.  This loan will have two-year maturity and one-year extension option.  We’ve consistently co-invested with some of the best capitalized institutions in the world and have carefully structured our joint venture leverage to be generally in line with our own balance sheet. Of the remaining $460 million in 2008 joint venture maturities, of which less than $70 million is our proportionate share, nearly 75% does not incur until December and the weighted average loan to value on these assets is less than 60%. Turning to development funding, we continued to see opportunities to obtain construction financing at commercially reasonable pricing.  During the fourth quarter we obtained a $60 million tax-exempt loan relating to our Gulfport Mississippi development.  The current rate on this floating rate loan is less than 3% and it matures in 2037.  Proceeds from this loan are held in an interest-bearing restricted cash account that will be used to fund the development costs. We have also executed a construction loan term sheet on our development project in Homestead Florida for $71 million with pricing at LIBOR plus 105 basis points.  With the current lowered LIBOR rates we will continue to pursue construction financing on several additional projects that are under construction or nearing construction such as Horseheads, New York; Seabrook, New Hampshire and development projects in Canada and Russia. Moreover, as we discussed on the last call we expect to be a net seller of assets in 2008 and expect to generate several hundred million of proceeds relating to merchant build assets, land parcels and non-core properties.  As a result, aggregate available 2008 proceeds based on what I just discussed including $350 million secured financing, $200 million to $300 million of construction loan proceeds, approximately $500 million in asset sales plus over $100 million in net retained capital are expected to exceed $1.2 billion, which is more than sufficient to meet our 2008 debt maturity and development spending requirements. In addition, our revolving credit availability at December 31, 2007 was over $600 million.  Furthermore, we own nearly 300 fully unencumbered operating properties representing approximately $6 billion of total asset value.  As a result, we are comfortable with our financial position and our ability to access attractively priced capital in this market. With that I’ll turn it over to Dan.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Bill and good morning.  Due to the general economic concerns within the retail sector and elsewhere, we were very focused on our fourth quarter leasing numbers as we were concerned that tenant interest in new space and lease rates could come under pressure during the peak of uncertainty during a fairly mediocre holiday sales season.  However, you will note from our earnings release Q4 of 2007 was another solid quarter which continued to demonstrate the health of our portfolio and continue to demonstrate sound fundamentals amongst most of our major retail partners With an overall lease rate of approximately 96%, nearly 9 million square feet of transactions completed and leasing spreads continuing to track at near-record levels, 2007, in general, was a very solid year. That being said, we continue to monitor the market carefully and philosophically have made some revisions to our leasing strategy in 2008.  Most notably we have aggressively pursued renewals regardless of termination dates, to ensure better visibility on our core 2008 base rent. As a result, we have completed or have received notice of intent to renew at the appropriate time on 74% of all 2008 renewals.  This is substantially ahead of our typical percentage in a typical year.  Moreover, we have accelerated many of our portfolio reviews with tenants, doubled our meeting volume at this past December’s New York ICSC and continue to use our outstanding tenant relationships to achieve commitments for our 2008 budgeted new deals. As a result of the budgeted proposed leases for 2008, we have excellent visibility on 64% of the budgeted square footage which again is far ahead of previous years.  We are carefully balancing our desire for visibility with our interest in achieving growth consistent with the quality of our centers and our historic averages. We have said for many years and continue to believe that in a price deflationary environment for most retail sectors, retailers often rely very heavily on external growth to bolster their overall financial health and execute their expansion strategy.  While there is clearly a slowdown of new store growth for the less successful merchants, the most successful will use the current environment to their advantage by stealing market share from their struggling competitors. We have seen this happen through many prior cycles and consider most of our tenants well-positioned to outperform once again. Our job as a retail landlord is to ensure that we execute leases with the retailers that are gaining market share, driving sales and offering the best experience to the consumer.  We have a very strong track record of success in these efforts and believe that our top retailers continue to be relatively well positioned, competitively and financially. Finally, in regard to leasing, while there is enormous attention given to retailers’ comp store sales it’s important to note that in the short-term there’s little direct impact on our revenue stream if those comps decline.  With less than 1% of our total revenue tied to sales results, our position as a landlord with stable, long-term leases is more similar to that of a creditor or bondholder.  As Bill mentioned, in today’s environment there’s been a long overdue renewed focus on tenant credits which we think is a very healthy trend and one that we hope will continue. Like the overall leasing environment, development activity is another area in which we are proceeding in a particularly prudent manner and I would like to discuss some of the basic fundamentals related to that area.  First I should reiterate that our development pipeline has not materially changed in size, timing or expected returns but our disclosure has been adjusted to be more in line with our peers by excluding projects yet to commence.  Listing projects yet to commence is a competitive disadvantage as some of our competitors were using that information as a sourcing tool for their own pipelines. We didn’t continue to see value in providing opportunities to others therefore we eliminated that statistic. Like the overall leasing environment, the projects currently in our pipeline were underwritten at a time when spreads between yields and market pricing were at all-time highs and generated value in the 350 to 400 basis point range.  Historically that range has run between 200 and 250 basis points within our industry.  Therefore, even if cap rates expand and yields compress, these developments still remain an attractive risk adjusted means to create value. While we carefully limit our investment in projects prior to our complete due diligence, this spread also provides an appropriate contingency to carry the weight for projects that, after thorough scrutiny, no longer meet our required return thresholds.  Moreover and probably most importantly, in regard to our 2008 wholly-owned deliveries, we currently have excellent visibility on 77% of the available space and 70% of the space in our joint venture deliveries. In addition, we’re also seeing some significant trends that have emerged over the last several months.  First and most important to retailers is certainty of execution, which has become absolutely paramount.  As capital has become scarce, retailers inherently look for quality sponsorship of projects to ensure that completion dates are met and co-tenancy requirements fulfilled. Today, with our track record, access to capital and retailer relationships, our tenants are counting on our platform to provide them with new store locations in a consistent manner.  As a result, we are seeing additional opportunities where the sponsorship is questionable but the retailer believes in the site and the market.  On a very selective basis, we are reviewing those opportunities. Second, we are seeing a rapidly growing group of undercapitalized developers looking for a stronger partner to assist in completing projects.  There is a considerable and growing amount of true distress among many small developers.  The outcome of this trend is that fewer developments will be built and competition for sites and tenants will continue to decrease.  We will be able to proceed cautiously and as Scott mentioned, more selectively and profitably, in our investment decisions. Interestingly, with respect to our existing international portfolio and opportunities under consideration, leasing is actually at the low end of the risk spectrum.  We are cognizant of the risks associated with emerging markets; however we have been continually impressed with the number and quality of retailers looking to grow within or enter these markets as the underserved nature of the retail environment is fueling increased demand and exceptional rental growth. In summary, while the retail environment is slowing somewhat and the economic environment is uncertain at best, we just finished an outstanding year in regard to leasing, have good visibility on core, JV and development deliveries and overall occupancies for 2008.  We continue to see strong interest in emerging markets and have the luxury of being more selective in deploying capital in a much less competitive environment. These are the cycles where relationships and platform really matter and we look forward to leveraging our internal expertise for the benefit of our shareholders going forward. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to describe what I think is the most important announcement this company has made with respect to its employee incentive compensation structure.  In December, our board of directors approved the 2007 supplemental equity award plan and this plan was disclosed in an 8-K filed on December 6. The plan establishes two total shareholder return hurdles, an absolute 9% annual return and a relative out performance measure judging against the [FCEIX] Total Return Equity Index.  Both performance hurdles must be met over a three to five-year measurement period in order for any participant to receive any compensation from the plan.  There is no guaranteed minimum, accrual or payment allowed with the initial performance period.  The significance of this plan is that it represents a seachange in our approach to incentive comp. In contrast to previous plans, participation in this plan is broadly shared among all 43 members of our executive committee.  This plan is the result of intensive study and review by our board of directors to fully align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders in a manner that focuses on total shareholder return, rewards our performance and retains key employees, which is obviously critical to our future success. We are very proud of our team and understand the unparalleled value that human capital plays in our business model.  As a result of the plan, we will incur a $0.05 per share non-cash expense in 2008.  This charge will be incurred in year 2 and 3 of the plan and reduced to lower amounts in years 4 and 5. Again, our people make the difference and we are very pleased to align their interests so deeply within the organization.  Now on that note I’d like to the turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Dan.  Given the relatively uncertain economic and capital market conditions that we are experiencing today, we are very focused on executing our investment strategy in a thoughtful and disciplined fashion.  Based upon the opportunities that we are seeing today, we believe the greatest risk-adjusted returns are available in development as we capitalize on the stress that many private developers are experiencing in funding leasing projects. We expect much of this development investment to be funded by asset sales and we continue to expect to be a net seller of assets in 2008. Given the continued demand for our asset class and the positive benefit that dispositions can have on our overall portfolio performance and operational efficiency, we expect to sell additional non-core assets.  Even if pricing changes, we would still expect to complete some sales considering our reinvestment opportunities would still likely be more attractive. We also continue to sell some very high quality, core, newly developed assets where the highly predictable nature of these assets’ cash flows work well for our institutional partners.  The capital from these sales can be rapidly recycled in new developments with immediately positive NAV implications, though a positive FFO impact is a bit further out.  We also continue to review a broad set of potential acquisition opportunities but are currently not under contract to buy any assets right now. With respect to cap rates, we’ve received consistent feedback from buyers, sellers, financing sources and brokers and can comfortably say that for higher quality assets, cap rates in the low sixes are still quite achievable.  As shopping center cap rates never declined as significantly as other property types, it’s reasonable to assume there’s less potential for cap rate expansion. Moreover, the spread between retail cap rates and Treasury’s is well above its long-term average indicating that real estate risk is already well reflected in current pricing, at least  from a historical perspective. In general, we’re receiving strong, positive interest from a variety of private capital investors both domestic and international to own high quality shopping centers and to maintain or grow their relationships with DDR.  Their approach is appropriately more caution than the last year or two, but they continue to focus on their long-term return goals and the basic fundamentals of our business rather than market timing. At this point demand remains strong for value-add opportunities including ground-up development.  There’s also good partner interest in the new, stable, low risk centers coming out of our development pipeline that could result in merchant building gains.  Given this institutional interest, we expect to be raising new capital and investing on behalf of our joint ventures during 2008. We also expect to be selling assets on behalf of our partners this year as we continue to actively evaluate all of the assets in our portfolio subject to our partners’ interest and apply consistent investment rationale.  As part of our effort to continue to expand our fund management business for the benefit of both Developers Diversified and our investors, we continue to spend time evaluating fund structure.  Given the number of questions that we’ve received in the past few months from investors and analysts, it’s obvious that you’re doing the same so we thought it was worth our time on this call to review the basic terms of our funds and joint ventures. One, our institutional clients generally prefer relatively conservative leverage of 40% to 65% and want to be financed on a long-term basis.  As a result, our consolidated financial ratios are quite comparable to those including our proportion of joint venture debt. Two, we’ve carefully selected partners with interest in long-term ownership goals that align well with our own and therefore we are not subject to any significant buy-sell agreements where assets can be put to us.  As most of our larger funds are relatively new, there are also no contractual redemption rights in the next several years. Three, all of our funds, with the exception of Macquarie DDR Trust are closed end which provide for contractual liquidation terms at their back end and limit potential conflicts between DDR-sponsored vehicles. Now I’d like to return the call to Scott for his concluding remarks
Scott A. Wolstein: Thank you, David.  Before we open the call for your questions I want to reaffirm our 2008 FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per share.  With respect to transactional income items, I expect these to be recognized late in the year with minimal activity during the first quarter.  I suggest that analysts adjust their models for these line items appropriately. With that, I’ll turn it over to the operator to receive your questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tony Howard -Hilliard Lyons.  You may proceed
Tony Howard -Hilliard Lyons: Good morning, everyone.  Thanks for the extra comments on the development pipeline.  Even if you subtract the ones that are shadow pipeline, have there been any delays in your development pipeline from 2008 to 2009 or 2010?
David Oakes: There have not been delays in 2008 to 2009.  We have been broached by some tenants who have asked to delay some of the openings, as Scott mentioned, he heard quite a bit of that at the ICSC meeting, but we actually were able to avoid that through conversations with our retail partners.  So while there is pressure in the market to delay certain openings for certain tenants, we have not experienced that yet.
Tony Howard -Hilliard Lyons: G&A is up substantially year over year and also sequentially. I was wondering if there were any extraordinary items in there and also what would be a good run rate on a quarterly basis for 2008?
William H. Schafer: No, as Dan spoke about, we did implement a supplemental equity award plan in the fourth quarter that added some expense there.  Obviously this year, with our acquisition of the Inland portfolio, increased our overall G&A year-over-year comparable, but the amount that we reflected I think in the fourth quarter, again with a little bit of additional increase going forward with the supplemental equity award plan is probably pretty much on target for a run rate.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Just to clarify that a little bit.  The total G&A excluding the supplemental equity award plan expense was 4.6% of total revenue, including our joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2007.  It was 4.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ambika Goel - Citi.
Ambika Goel: Can we get some color on the dispositions, just the timing and how cap rate expectations have changed in the past six months?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: As we look at it today, we would expect the dispositions to be spread through the majority of the year.  Obviously per Scott’s comments less in the first quarter somewhat just as a function of timing, the way that the year works out and the marketing process for assets works out.  But we would expect asset sales to begin to hit in the second, third and fourth quarters. Cap rate expectations I think are relatively consistent with 12 to 24 months ago but probably somewhat higher than six to nine months ago.  There was a peak in pricing but very consistent with our long-term expectations of where pricing for these assets comes in, particularly for higher quality assets.  We would not expect much change in cap rates based on the IRR those cap rates would make available to buyers.
Scott A. Wolstein: Ambika, I think the other thing that is important to note is the obviously the leveraged buyer has left the market and when you’re dealing with non-institutional quality assets, it’s going to be much more difficult to bundle them into large portfolios.  What you’ll probably see is a lot more smaller transactions than the type of non-core assets sales we completed in 2007 where we were able to bundle $600 million in assets to one buyer who was using leverage aggressively. So on the institutional capital side, you know you’re dealing with institutional quality assets.  That’s a different story.  But when you’re dealing with the non-core stuff, it’s going to be a little tougher sledding in terms of being able to do large transactions.
Ambika Goel: Digging a little deeper, can you give an absolute cap rate number that you expect these sales at and are these assets under contract at this point?  And if not, what is getting you comfortable with the fact that these dispositions will occur this year?
Scott A. Wolstein: Well we are clearly comfortable or we wouldn’t have guided you to that.  No, we’re not going to announce cap rates.  We’re negotiating with buyers.  We’re not going to tell them what they’re going to pay.   I think David has been pretty clear as to where he thinks the cap rate environment is and there’s a lot of different assets at different cap rates based on quality.
Operator: Your next question comes from Greg Smith - Merrill Lynch.
Greg Smith: I see that Circuit City is one of your top ten tenants and they’re in a couple of development projects.  I’m just wondering, would you still look to Circuit City to anchor projects going forward or have you changed it on that?
William H. Schafer: We still would look to Circuit City to anchor projects going forward.  The consumer electronics business in general has been robust, although their sales have not been.  They have a very aggressive plan to remerchandise their stores.  In some cases there’s been, as you know, some significant managerial changes.  But we are not giving up on Circuit City.  We think that the new stores that we’ve been doing for them are performing well.  They clearly have problems with their older format stores and getting out of those stores is difficult outside of bankruptcy and it’s been difficult and that has been a drag on their company. But we’ve spent a lot of time with them.  We’ve spent a lot of time with their top management people to understand what their business model is.  While we would always proceed cautiously with tenants that we have some credit concerns with, we would not avoid them if they were the appropriate tenant from a merchandise mix for one of our centers.
Scott A. Wolstein: Although, I think I would probably take issue with the term anchor with respect to a tenant the size of Circuit City.  Certainly we would never develop a project where they were the lead tenant or even one of the top two or three tenants in terms of scale.  Circuit City is a 35,000 to 50,000 foot tenant and would be one of many, many category pillars in that size range.  It would never be a tenant that would make the difference on proceeding or not with a new project.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: But one of the things that’s important, Greg, is that when we do a center and we look at the merchandise mix, consumer electronics in some cases play a very important role.  Like most categories within our universe, there’s really only two.  In some cases Best Buy is already in the market but consumer electronics still plays an important role in the overall regional draw of the center.  So even though there are some local players that are in certain markets, Circuit City’s credit profile and the transparency of their financial performance far exceeds that of the local tenants.
Greg Smith: In terms of the national versus the more regional players, has that become a more important focus in these tougher credit times or the same as it was let’s say a year ago?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: There are so few local tenants today, as Bill said, I think it’s about 6% within our portfolio.  The local tenants in general or even some of the large regionals are really scaling down and the roster of that tenant base has been shrinking rather dramatically. The vast majority of our focus, 90%, 95% of our centers, are leased to national tenants.  In general credit becomes more important in this environment.  Like I mentioned, we welcome that analysis.  There are some regional tenants that have outstanding credit, some of them much better than their national brethren.  But that’s the exception, not the rule.  So we really do focus mostly on the main national that we can do multi deals with at a single sitting.
William H. Schafer: I think the great exception to that is probably in the grocery business.  The regionals typically are stronger than the nationals and have more focused business models and are probably outperforming.  But in the other categories I completely agree with Dan.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: A question for you, going back to development.  Looking at deliveries, probably 2009, 2010, you mentioned on the last call holding off a bit, pre-leasing some of those developments at this point, waiting for better pricing down the road.  It sounds like you’re much more focused obviously on the 2008 rollovers in terms of the core portfolio.  I’m just wondering if you’re still willing to hold off in terms of the pre-leasing? Back to slippage, is there a pre-leasing level at which you need to see in terms of breaking ground or in which case you’d move some of those developments, push them out further?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, you’re right.  We’re very focused on the 2008 deliveries.  I can tell you though, for our 2009 deliveries, we’re tracking exactly where we’d like to be at this point in time.  This point in time is going into ICSC in May.  Our 2009 deliveries are tracking at about 64%.  Where we have real good visibility on tenant interest or have agreements done with our major tenants.  So that’s a number that’s important to us.  That 64%/65% gives us a lot of comfort to move forward with the project because a lot of the upside in the deal is in that last 35% and the outparcels which we do hold off until the very end. So for ‘08, we were happy with where we are.  For ‘09 we’re happy with where we are going into Vegas at about 64%.  That is a number that we internally target on a pretty consistent basis.
Jay Habermann: The $1.5 billion or so that’s on the line of credit, I think you mentioned an additional $600 million of capacity. Is that factored into guidance or any sort of terming out of that down the line at this point or is that assumed to be capped on the lines for the full year?
Scott A. Wolstein: Jay, could you state that again?
Jay Habermann: I’m looking at the supplemental.  You have about $1.5 billion on the line, the secured and unsecured.  Is that going to be kept as such for the balance of 2008?
William H. Schafer: You’re referring to both the line and our term loan, correct?
Jay Habermann: Yes, I am
William H. Schafer: The term loan will certainly be outstanding that has a set maturity out there so that amount will remain.  Our line balance actually will go up and down based on development spending.  Like I said, we have $350 million of financing that will close probably by the end of the first quarter here which will then be used to pay down our revolving credit facilities also.
Jay Habermann: Thank you.
David Oakes: Jay, clearly the line will be paid down during the year and the outstanding balance will be less than it is today, if that’s your question.  That is already factored in.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller - JP Morgan.
Michael Mueller: Going back to the development pipeline one more time, it looks like about $115 million of deliveries in 2008.  Can you walk us through what the ramp up looks like as you move into 2009/2010, and then also give us a range of development yields?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Sure.  The yields that we’re seeing range from a 9% to a 10.5% across the board depending on when the projects were underwritten and that’s been pretty consistent now for quite some time.  When we bring deals to our investment committee to decide whether we approve them or not we like to see projects that are at a 10% but we don’t always get there.  Or some projects start at a 10% and they drift downwards into that 9%, 9.5% area. So that’s pretty consistent with what we’re seeing.  Anything that comes in lower than a 9% we take issue with and we think our capital is better spent elsewhere.  That’s how we are looking at the yields. In regard to our deliveries for 2009, we’re looking at deliveries that should be almost double what they are in 2008.  That is including the properties that I was mentioning to Jay earlier that’s about 64% leased or we have good comfort will be leased in the very near future.
Michael Mueller: If you go out one more year further, is that still trending up in 2010, do you think at this point?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, it’s going to be much higher in 2010 because the international projects come on line.  By 2010 the percentage of projects in Brazil, Russia, Ukraine will be almost half of the new development pipeline.  Some of that obviously we don’t own 100% of those.  But there are going to be significant deliveries in both the emerging markets as well as Canada by 2010. The other thing to keep in mind as Scott and I both mentioned about the opportunities with the stressed private developers currently, depending on the pace and the availability of product through that vehicle, 2010 could also increase rather dramatically as those projects come on line that we’re currently looking at.
Operator: Your next question comes from David [Toaddy] - Lehman Brothers.
David [Toaddy]: Are you yet seeing any opportunities in terms of distressed opportunities internationally? If not are you seeing any changes in pricing or interest overseas?
Scott A. Wolstein: I don’t think it’s a question of distress internationally, but there’s certainly a much less crowded playing field.  We certainly have first mover advantage in many of the markets in which we are operating both in Russia and in Brazil as far as competition in those markets.  So I wouldn’t call it distressed.  But you are talking about markets where the occupancy rate is almost 100%, and in many of the markets in which we will be developing, we’ll really be developing the only modern shopping center to serve a population approaching 1 million people.  So in terms of just the supply and demand metrics internationally, they’re far better frankly than they are domestically.
David [Toaddy]: Secondly, are you seeing any change in interest from your joint venture partners in terms of increased appetite for investment or a change in expectations of  some of the terms you reviewed today, is there any shifting going on relative to today’s economic situation?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Not meaningfully.  I think there’s an appropriate level of greater caution due to the somewhat more uncertain conditions that we’re all experiencing.  The partners we work with are large and they’re smart and they see what’s going on in the markets.  So I think they’re obviously aware of what’s going on today.  On the other hand, because they are large and smart, they’re also generally focused on long-term goals.  The returns that they need to hit to meet their pensioners or whatever the end game is for their capital. I think they clearly shy away from any level of market timing and they’ve got to focus on their ability to generate IRRs and uncorrelated IRRs from each portion of their portfolio.  So we continue to see interest from partners in putting capital into real estate investments.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank.
Lou Taylor: David staying with you for a second and probing the dispositions a little bit.  Has the mix of properties you’re hoping to sell in 2008 changed much in the last 90 days as the capital markets have shifted and the mix of potential buyers has changed?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think there’s certainly been some pricing change within the scope of the various projects we could sell.  On the margin there’s probably some change in the basket.  But the reality is the two basic buckets into which the assets we are selling fall still generally remain the same through that period.  It’s that group of higher quality, newly developed centers with an extremely low risk profile that again in this environment of uncertainty, is exactly what we’re hearing from market sources as well as what we’re seeing in the pricing overall.  That’s exactly what a large number of people want to be able to be at a lower risk profile. On the other side, for some of the non-core assets that’s more a function internally of we do think there are better opportunities for us to redeploy some of that capital even where we see pricing for those assets today.
Lou Taylor: Scott, you mentioned earlier on the call and I wasn’t clear whether you mentioned the investment opportunities that you saw in ‘08 were increasing in terms of becoming a lot more interesting.  Are you seeing that now or do you expect to see that later on in the year?
Scott A. Wolstein: We have actually created a new department within the company to prospect for distressed projects that are in the pipeline of small private developers who might be encountering some financial distress.  I think we’ve identified literally dozens of those projects in which we’re evaluating, discussing and negotiating.  It’s something that we’ve seen in real time.  It’s a very, very difficult time for somebody who has traditionally been able to bring projects on without investing equity and being able to finance virtually 100% of costs with debt. The projects we’re talking about in our business today range from $50 million to over $100 million in size.  If a lender is going to limit his construction loan to 60%, 70% of cost you’re talking about the private guy having to reach into his pocket for $30 million, there aren’t too many people like that in the United States that are willing to do that on any specific project. So really does require an institutional capital partner like us or like some of our core investors, we would pursue many of those investors in tandem with some of our institutional investors.  I expect to see significant amounts of that type of activity as the opportunity clearly exists. As a result of that, there’s two things I want to comment on because I’ve caught a little bit of tone in terms of the questions that people are concerned about our ability to lease the development projects. First of all, I think that conclusion is really counterintuitive.  It’s exactly the opposite.  What we said in the script and I want to reiterate is that virtually all the tenants with the exception of women’s ready-to-wear are pretty much sticking to their expansion goals in terms of new store development yet many of the projects they were working on and counting on to fill those needs are not going to happen because the developers are having difficulty meeting timetables and deliveries because of financing. Actually I expect the leasing environment to be very positive for companies that have projects that are real and have capital and financing because when tenants don’t meet their open to buy for a year they panic.  They have bought merchandise for these stores and they have to find a place to put it. So I think a lot of the concern that I’m hearing about in our ability to lease these projects is somewhat misplaced. I also want to comment on this disposition issue because I think there’s a little bit of misunderstanding there as well.  Because of the precipitous drop in interest rates, everything we sell this year will be dilutive.  Our guidance doesn’t rely on a significant volume of disposition.  The volume of dispositions that we forecast for the year is really a part of the capital recycling strategy where we think we can reinvest that capital at higher returns and set ourselves up for better growth in the future. If the downside scenario was that there wasn’t a market on the buy side for some of these assets it really wouldn’t affect us significantly either in financial flexibility or in terms of our earnings guidance.  So I don’t think there should be a lot of concern about that, quite frankly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: The $0.05 on the compensation expense, I’m trying to understand it.  Did part of that occur in the fourth quarter or do we put it all in the first quarter of ‘08 and the same thing with ‘09 or how do we do that exactly?
William H. Schafer: Well, the plan commenced on December 1, if you will, so there was a portion in the fourth quarter.  On an annual basis, as Dan indicated, it’s about $0.05 per share.
Rich Moore: Do we put that all in the first quarter or most of it in the first quarter?
William H. Schafer: No, it’s evenly throughout the year.
Rich Moore: Then back to the asset sales for just a second, Scott,  I saw that  you put 37 properties up for sale.  First of all, is that true? Is that a portfolio thing you’re looking to do? Is it something we should put in discontinued ops because it’s held for sale at this point?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We don’t have a portfolio of 37 assets up for sale currently.  I think we’ve outlined the comments, spoke about the newly developed assets as well as about some non-core asset sales but also I think clearly we have gotten the signal from the market and incorporated that into our plan that large portfolio transactions that was possible last year on attractive terms in our opinion is unlikely to be possible in that same size this year. I would expect much smaller volumes of non-core asset sales of perhaps a larger number of individual transaction closings but smaller overall dollar volume and much smaller tranches than last year.
Scott A. Wolstein: Referring to [Grove] Street, I haven’t seen it but that sounds like it’s the result of an overzealous broker.
Rich Moore: Not necessarily true.  I understand.  Lastly, if I could, bankruptcies, Dan, we have heard a lot of talk about bankruptcies being down and store closings actually continuing to occur but not from tenants going bankrupt; just store closings.  How do you look at that? Where do you see bankruptcies, where do you see store closings?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Bankruptcies are down for a couple reasons.  One is that some of the tenants that you would sort of intuitively think would have or should be filing for bankruptcy or headed that way have gone private so there’s less transparency on their performance although we have a good feel from the market of how they’re doing, but they have infusion of new capital and I think that capital’s more reluctant to file bankruptcy. I think there’s also a significant impact we’re seeing of the new bankruptcy law which is really much more favorable to landlords and much less favorable to the retail environment.  Since that law was put into place we have not seen any significant bankruptcies and we’ve been questioned by a number of people including ICSC about what our view is of the new law.  The answer is we are really not sure yet because we haven’t seen a lot. But I do think one of the things the new law has done is it’s made it less attractive for tenants to file and therefore there’s no question we are seeing an increase in tenants that are interested in negotiating the termination of leases.  We view that as very positive for a number of reasons but probably the most important one is that we are able to negotiate a healthy payment from a tenant and we have the ability to mark this space to market.  If the space is over market, then of course we don’t have to do a termination.  We can maintain the rent as it currently is. But in most cases when we’ve been approached by tenants and that volume of business has increased significantly over the last six months, we can effectuate a termination that is very much to the benefit not only of the property, but financially.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan: The structure of your new incentive comp program sounds smart with a meaningful absolute and relative measure.  I’m curious for the 43 participants, how meaningful it is as a percentage of total comp, what would the incentive comp typically represent?  Is there a meaningful difference in that percentage between highly compensated executives and those who are less highly compensated?
Scott A. Wolstein: It’s extremely meaningful.  First of all, for those people who in the 43 category, for those who had not been in a program before which really is about 35 or 36 of those people this could represent three, four, five times their annual comp depending on who they are and at what level.  It has a scale that goes from a vice presidential level up through the CEO -- or I guess up to the CEO.  You can’t really go through the CEO, but up to the CEO. The percentages vary based on your position.  So for example, if there’s a vice president of our organization that gets promoted in the period of time to a senior vice president, their percentage of the pool will then increase.  But it’s been extremely well received by our employee base.  The numbers are substantial.  Keeping in mind that 35 or 36 of the people have never been in a plan before, it gives them a great opportunity if we truly outperform for tremendous wealth creation.
Jim Sullivan: There was a comment earlier that local tenants in your portfolio are in businesses that are less cyclical.  Could you just expand on that comment?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think the difficulty with some of the local tenants is that you know there are transparency issues, they’re obviously not reporting every three months and providing disclosure to the SEC that allows us to dig quite significantly into their details. But the number of sandwich stores, nail salons, hair salons, liquor stores, it’s not the most glamorous list of businesses but it’s also oftentimes family-run, appropriately capitalized, long-term businesses that don’t just have their booms and busts along with the economic cycle but in many cases tend to be quite consistent businesses over the course of the cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: On the share repurchase, can I get your thoughts there in terms of plans? Obviously with the stock trading at nearly 8% implied cap rate at this point any thoughts on share repurchase given being a net seller this year?
William H. Schafer: I think share repurchase stands as one very attractive potential use of proceeds from assets sales this year. The arbitrage between the public market and the private market continues to be relatively significant and we would look to continue to take advantage of that.  However, we will very carefully live within the constraints of our credit rating and our bondholders overall, in addition to just the mindset that the goal is not to change the risk profile or the leverage profile of this company to make any sort of bet on the direction of the stock but more to the extent that there is a mispricing between two assets that we can trade between. I think that at current pricing levels there would absolutely be a use of proceeds from asset sales to continue share repurchase.
Jay Habermann: Is that built into guidance this year?  The assumption for share repurchase?
William H. Schafer: There is not.
Jay Habermann: Just sticking with guidance, getting to the low end of the range, can you just remind us what the occupancy assumption is there?  What’s the potential downside to occupancy in 2008?
Scott A. Wolstein: I think we’re relatively consistent.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The occupancy assumptions for 2008, there’s probably a 25 basis point swing on the lower end but it’s relatively flat.
Jay Habermann: You think it’s flat this year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ambika Goel - Citi.
Ambika Goel: Just a quick question on the change in disclosure.  On the development pipeline it now says estimated initial anchor opening and before it said estimated substantial completion date.  So for example, at the [UK] development, the substantial completion date was 2009 and now the initial anchor opening is the second half of 2010.  That happened with a couple of projects.  I’m not sure if that means that there’s development delay or it’s just a change in the way it’s being reported.  So if you could give a little color on that?
William H. Schafer: I think a large portion of that really is a change in the way we’ve reported it and candidly portions of our supplemental have served as an important internal document for this company indicating both funding issues related to development as well as from a development department and construction department’s perspective, when those projects were going to achieve substantial completion. On the other hand, from the perspective I believe of quite a few or the majority of the people on the phone, the mindset was that date represented some level of at least initial stabilization from those projects and so there was somewhat of a disconnect between the dates that we were providing compared to the dates that we thought were then in reality most useful for financial modeling of when the cash flows from a project would actually substantially commence. That was the impetus of the change there that has in some cases, at least, shown later dates.  But in reality is comparing apples to oranges from last quarter’s disclosure to this quarter’s.
Ambika Goel: Okay.  That makes sense.  Thanks.  Then in 2007, by my estimates there was about $94 million of transactional profits split between merchant build sales, promote income, acquisition fees from Inland. Could you give some type of guidance on how in 2008 that income will be split between those different buckets, given that from my assumption I think if it’s the same as last quarter that transactional income is going to be flat with 2007 levels?
William H. Schafer: I think that’s what we’ve provided thus far, the transactional sort of income would be relatively flat with ‘07.  I think there are portions of that that probably go down significantly such as the tax benefit, such as the acquisition fee on a portfolio of that size. But on the other hand, it’s not just 2007 for this company that’s had a consistent number of transactional opportunities that have been profitable for the company.  I think the overall guidance is that we expect a consistent level of activity.  We do feel comfortable that there will be a reasonably meaningful portion of merchant building gains that are included in that as well as other items that overall should get us to, as we define at least, reasonably comparable levels as 07 and that’s where the guidance stands today and that’s absolutely our expectation for 2008.
Ambika Goel: Just a little bit more on promote income.  Are you expecting that to be up or down from 2007?
William H. Schafer: Right now we expect it to be down from 2007.  We had one very successful joint venture that wound up or in fact was rolled into a new joint venture in 2007 that resulted in a larger than normal promote.  I think right now at least we are not expecting to comp that in 2008.
Operator: That concludes the Q&A session.  Thank you for your participation in today’s conference.  This concludes the presentation.  You may now disconnect."
2,SITC,1,2008,2008-04-25 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the first quarter 2008 Developers Diversified Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Mrs. Michelle Dawson. Please proceed, please.
Michelle Dawson: Thank you, Erica, and good morning. Thanks for joining us. On today's call you'll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, Bill Schafer and David Oakes. Before we begin, I'd lake to alert you that certain of our statements today maybe forward-looking. Although, we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, maybe found in the press release issued yesterday and filed on Form-8K and in our Form-10K for the year ended December 31st, 2007, and filed with the SEC. I'd also like to request that callers observe a two-question limit during the Q & A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott Wolstein: Thank you, Michelle, and good morning, everybody. I'm pleased to announce this quarter's financial results of $0.83 per share or funds from operations, which compares to $0.91 per share in the prior year. And after adjusting for certain one time items as Bill will discuss shortly, our results actually show a 50% year-over-year increase. Considering the challenging environment in which we are operating, we are very pleased with our portfolio performance and with our outlook for the remainder of the year. As our assets feature long-term leases with high credit quality retailers. And as our tenants appeal to consumer's demand for value and convenience, our portfolio has historically performed very well in times of macroeconomic stress. Our executive team has seen many difficult cycles. We know that whenever there is dislocation in the credit markets, there are also very attractive investment opportunities for those that are well positioned. During today's call, you will hear more about how we are advancing our corporate priority. First, we remain highly focused on our balance sheets and we continue to find financing at attractive pricing. Bill Schafer will give you a recap of our recent financing activity, our capital plan for the remainder of the year. And you will hear what he is sharing from his banking relationships. Second, our portfolio is well positioned to outperform in an environment where consumers are more price sensitive than ever and our largest tenants offering the most attractive value proposition to consumers. As presented in our quarterly financial supplement, our property fundamentals remain strong and consistent with our history. Rent growth is solid. Spreads on new leases are strong, at 28% and a portfolio lease rate of nearly 96% remains high. While some deceleration in retail or new store growth is expected and certainly makes sense given a driven dramatic decline in new retail development starts. Many of our tenants actually do very well in tougher economies and view these challenges as an opportunity to gain market share. In this economy, where we are seeing many consumers save their shopping patterns to save money, retailers that offer price leadership and value will be the clear beneficiary. Moreover, many of our largest tenant relationships have the highest credit ratings in the industry, and the best balance sheets in the business. Third, we are seeing more buzz in investment opportunities created by market dislocation. Dan will describe how we are evaluating opportunities to partner with local developers, which are experiencing the greatest distress as a result of the current lending environment. And you will hear how international development opportunities are complimenting our domestic pipeline. David Oakes will then address our capital allocation strategy and explain how our decisions to take advantage of today's attractive investment opportunities are carefully balanced within the objective of preserving capital. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill Schafer.
Bill Schafer: Thanks Scott. With regard to our fist quarter operating results, I would like to highlight certain items, primarily those that were included in our prior year results that did not reoccur in 2008. First, the most significant item related to the release of certain tax valuation reserves, which resulted in a net $15 million tax benefit in 2007, as compared to $1 million of expense in 2008. Second, a reduction in other income of approximately $4.3 million, which was attributable to an acquisition fee of $6.3 million earned in 2007, relating to the Inland transaction. This was partially offset by a $2 million increase in lease terminations in 2008, as compared to 2007. Third, merchant buildings, land sale gains and promoted income were $3.5 million higher than the first quarter of ’07, as compared to 2008. And fourth, interest income was $3.1 million higher in 2007, primarily due to interest earned on funds placed in escrow for Inland shareholders, until the transfer agent finalized distributions. And fifth, included in our 2007 G&A cost was approximately $4.9 million relating to a charge associated with the departure of our former President and certain Inland integration cost. After eliminating the impact of these items from each year’s FFO, the increase in FFO per share was over 15% in 2008, as compared to 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to a full quarter operating results from the inland acquisition, as compared to just over a month in 2007, and increase in same store net operating income, offset to a certain extent by an increase in bad debt expense. And an approximate 40 basis points decrease in the company’s weighted average interest rate in 2008, as compared to 2007. As you heard from Scott, from a financial perspective, our primary focus in 2008 will be with regard to our balance sheet. As Dan and David will discuss in more detail, given the abundance of opportunities available, we can afford to be much more selective with regard to how much capital is committed to construction in progress. As far as sources of funds are concerned as we discussed in February, the majority of our asset sales are expected to occur during the second half of the year. These sales are expected to generate several hundred million of proceeds to DDR and aggregate transactional income comparable to the levels achieved in 2007. We've also been very active in the debt markets. We just recently announced that we have closed on our $500 million in new financings including five year $350 million secured financing on [technical difficulty] six properties of loan to value of approximately 55% and an interest rate of 5%. The effective loan to value on these properties has been increased to 70%, as they are also included as collateral for our secured term loan, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 70 basis points. Other loan closings included a $71 million construction loan on our Homestead, Florida development and the refinancing of $72 million of joint-venture debt with a partner during the quarter. In addition, our 50% joint-venture with Sonae Sierra, which owns and develops retail real estate in Brazil, closed on a 50 million reais credit facility in late February. Year-to-date 15 properties were unencumbered with an aggregate value of approximately $700 million. In addition we just closed this week on a three year $40 million construction loan relating to the expansion of our corporate headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio. The interest rate on this loan is at LIBOR plus 110 basis points. We are also actively pursuing additional secured project refinancing, primarily with regard to our joint-ventures, and we are confident that these would be successfully completed over the next several months. Our line of credit availability at March 31, 2008 was nearly $600 million and we continue to maintain a substantial unencumbered asset pool of nearly $6 billion. Since the second quarter of 2007, the debt capital markets have been extremely volatile and challenging, in fact significant financial institutions have experienced unprecedented write-offs and liquidity issues themselves. Currently vendor appetite for new financing is mixed, rates available from commercial and investment banks are widely divergent. Often the larger banks are interested in operating participations and their good opportunities for local and regional banks. We have also noted that write companies are becoming more selective and appear to be more interested in smaller loans up to around $50 million. The clear message we are receiving from all of our vendors is that the quality of sponsorship and the relationships strength are critical factors in their decision-making process. Fortunately, we have established excellent relationships with numerous financial institutions over the past 15 years, which have enabled us to continue to access the debt markets effectively over the past year. As we have discussed on almost every conference call, we believe that it is extremely important to maintain a conservative balance sheet and access to all types of capital, which provides maximum financial flexibility. And we will continue to operate in this manner. As Scott indicated we have successfully navigated ourselves through difficult economic times in the past and have emerged as a stronger company, due to the opportunities created in this type of environment, and we believe this to be true today as well. I will now turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Hurwitz: Thank you, Bill and good morning. I want to add to Scott’s remarks that our first quarter results demonstrate a strong start to the year, regarding the true fundamentals of our business. In spite of the uncertainty present in today’s economy, we are extremely pleased with the quality of our portfolio, the success of our leasing and development activities, and the internal strength of our infrastructure and resulting platform. Our strategic portfolio management efforts over the last few years in terms of acquiring high quality shopping centers, selling non-core assets, redeveloping existing properties and delivering new developments, have reduced the average age of our assets by over five years and have reduced the necessary amount of CapEx needed to lease and operate our properties. These improvements in the quality of our portfolio and the cash efficiency of our operations have enhanced our ability to produce positive results despite the current challenges facing the economy. Our first quarter leased rate was a very solid 95.8%. This was obviously a metric we were watching very closely, as the challenges facing the economy in Q3, and Q4 of 2007, and Q1 of 2008 were generally expected to negatively impact occupancy, and we are extremely pleased that our properties performed consistent with historical norms in that regard. Equally as pleasing, there continues to be a healthy demand for quality space. As illustrated by our 28% spread on new leases signed during the quarter, which continues to track well above our long term average. Our continued ability to post robust new rent spreads is indicative of the stellar efforts of our leasing team, the quality and geographic diversity of our portfolio, and the overall demand for prime retail locations. In addition, we executed over 2 million square feet of renewals, which posted average cash spreads of 7%. Importantly for 2008, our renewals are 80% complete, portfolio wide. Year-to-date we have proactively completed 30 portfolio reviews with many of our most active retailers. In those meetings, it has become clear that retailers are proceeding with new store expansion cautiously, and are looking at location and sponsorship as a key risk mitigators. As a result, we are seeing continued opportunities, some presented by the retailers themselves, as dislocation in the capital markets continues to eliminate many private developers and creates heightened uncertainty and much less transparency regarding tenants future openings. These factors combine to result in a greater awareness of sponsorship and focus on certainty of execution, which both work in our favor. With the Las Vegas RECon Convention on the horizon, it is our goal to further cultivate strong tenant relationships, primarily focusing on 2009 deals. And the continued listing of our development pipeline, which currently stands at 75% executed or committed. We're also talking with several tenants regarding a limited number of 2008 commitments, many of which are result of instances where other developers have failed to deliver space to tenants. To-date, our leasing team has scheduled over 800 meetings for RECon to facilitate tenant demand in opening new store locations throughout our portfolio. Contrary to the strong operating metrics, we are cognizant of the environment, and are very aware of bankruptcy and store closure possibilities. We know who is struggling within our portfolio and continue to engage in dialogue in an effort to mitigate risk and most importantly limit downtime if we do lose certain tenants. RECon gives us a great opportunity to market currently vacant and even anticipated vacant spaces even though the ultimate future of that space may not yet be determined by the tenant. Through our National Tenant Account Program, we will continue to monitor, communicate and actively manage the risk that is currently present. As we've said many times, retail is clearly a game of winners and losers. In a decelerating economic environment, it's natural to see retailers that offer shoppers a compelling value proposition and a strength of balance sheet to greatly expand their market share at expense of competitors that are less well positioned. As a retail landlord, we know that this can and will occur, and it does in our portfolio, it is our intent to take advantage of the opportunity to release the space as a means of maximizing revenue potential and limiting downtime. One example of this approach is reflected at our Rio Hondo center in Puerto Rico, where a 33, 000 square foot CompUSA store, the largest in our portfolio was located. We expect a soon to be announced investment grade category leader to assume the formal CompUSA space with no interruption in rent, no retrofit cost to us, plus payment of $1 million assignment fee. In total we had 11 CompUSA locations, eight of which currently have either tenant commitments or executed lease assignments with tenants such as Fresh Market, HomeGoods and Bye-Bye Baby. Within our development business, we continue to see value-add opportunities created by the current market dislocation. As I mentioned earlier, local developers appear to be the greatest source of the stress today. This trend began over a year ago, when a number of small local developers began coming to us and offering co-investment opportunities in their projects. We have seen this trend escalate over the last 12 months and today we are clearly seeing significant pressure on developers that do not have the wherewithal, both in terms of capital, and in terms of leasing relationships, to see their projects through to completion. We firmly believe that this trend will accelerate and deal economics will continually improve as we navigate the current cycle. Another obvious trend within the development sector that results from less private developer competition is that land prices and terms in general are more favorable than a year ago, which should have a positive impact on future yields. We are also seeing entitlement process become slightly less onerous to navigate, as municipality's desire for tax revenue becomes more acute. Overall, the combination of these market trends when coupled with our tenant relationships will put us in a strong position to maximize risk adjusted returns and achieve even better margins on future projects. In addition to the opportunities available in the US market, the opportunities we’re evaluating in our international markets are very compelling, but for different reasons. For example, the real estate markets in Brazil, Russia and even Canada are more fragmented and currently offer relatively less intense competition, creating niches for opportunistic investment. From a yield comparison standpoint, we are underwriting projects in Brazil to yield in the mid-teens on an un-levered cash on cost basis. Yields in Russia and Canada are lower than Brazil, but their supply constraint characteristics and growth profiles will offer attractive internal rates of return to our shareholders. Although many uncertainties can exist with international projects, the real estate risk of these projects in terms of lease-up is virtually nonexistent. For example, in Brazil retail sales rose over 9.5% in 2007, compared to the prior year. Retail sales in Canada grew by nearly 6% in 2007, and by over 15% in Russia. While development deliveries in our domestic portfolio will continue to ramp up over the next 18 months, the contribution from our international portfolio, where we expect to see significant value appreciation, will enhance our delivery volume in 2010 and beyond. In closing, our success is deeply rooted in our ability to attract and retain high caliber employees, who demonstrate relentless dedication and commitment to achieving our collective corporate goals. To that end, and regard to our annual review process, we recently awarded a record setting number of internal promotions to various business units, including leasing, development, property management, accounting, information technology, legal and marketing. Also, four members from our recent class of management trainees advanced to full time positions, while three members from prior classes were promoted to offices of the company and now have a position on our executive committee. As we are committed to achieving profitable results for our shareholders and institutional clients, we're also committed to rewarding those employees who excel and whose achievements have a meaningful impact on our overall corporate performance. At this point, I'd like to turn the call to David.
David Oakes: Thanks Dan. As you've already heard, our capital allocation decisions are regularly being reviewed and executed in a disciplined fashion. This reflects our primary interest in maintaining a strong balance sheet, while still allowing us to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities that are being created by the current market conditions. We are constantly reviewing investments, based upon on their risks and return attributes, and today's market is offering some interesting opportunities that we have not seen in many years. For example, we continue to view our development platform as an attractive means of creating value. On the domestic front, we continue to see opportunities to partner with local developers who are facing capital constraints and are finding it more difficult to deliver development projects. We expect to continue to see these opportunities in the coming quarters, and as we've mentioned previously, we have a dedicated team in place, sourcing these deals and evaluating the projects that best fit on our investment profile. Interestingly, despite the current verge in the development investment by the public markets, we are seeing considerable private market demand for the caliber of projects and returns that we have consistently been able to deliver, and we will consider working with this private capital in this regard. We recently announced the 6.5% stake in Macquarie DDR Trust. We view the purchase of NDT units as another attractive investment opportunity for DDR. By purchasing the Trust's units we were able to increase our ownership in some of the best assets in our portfolio in a manner that provides immediate and outsized returns. Purchasing these units also ensures our alignment of interest with those of other unit holders of the Trust. Also as we've stated in previous calls, we continue to view the repurchase of our own shares, an attractive vehicle for deploying capital and we regularly review share repurchases, one of the many investment alternatives available, but always with a careful eye on our balance sheer strength. Based on numerous meetings we had with institutional investors, its apparent that they continue to have interest in commercial real estate and top tier managers, but are now being more cautious given the uncertainty in asset pricing and lending markets. Despite the shift in demand and expectations, we feel that we are well positioned to continue to expand and strengthen our funds management business. As the commercial real estate environment continues to change; we view institutional joint-ventures as an attractive niche and feel we are well positioned to continue to create meaningful value for both our shareholders and our partners. Discussions with investors regarding the sales of certain recently build assets are also progressing. To-date and based on conversations we have with investors and brokers there is not any meaningful change in pricing and our plans remain the same for closing on the sale of these assets in the second part of 2008. We are seeing considerable interest from both foreign and domestic institutional entities, with strong balance sheet. As is our practice with transactions that are in progress, we will limit our comments on these sales until they are more final, so as to not compromise our negotiating position. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Scott for his closing remarks.
Scott Worstein: Thanks, David. As you’ve heard, we remain focused on our balance sheet while evaluating opportunities created by the distress in the market. We expect property fundamentals in our portfolio to remain stable as we are well positioned to benefit from an environment in which consumers are increasingly price sensitive and are less inclined to buy fully priced discretionary items. We are seeing this trend play out in the performance of department stores versus discount retailers, and among discount apparel retailers versus specialty retailers. This trend is even more pronounced among grocery retailers, where Wal-Mart is clearly gaining market share as food prices rise. There are several other aspects of our portfolio quality that help insulate us from more macro-volatility. The most important of those are, first, tenant credit quality, which is paramount, especially in today’s environment. Second, the relatively low amount of capital expenditures needed to maintain our shopping centers and achieve our same store NOI growth. These expenditures have a meaningful impact on the cash efficiency of our business, which again is more important today than ever. And third, the long term consistency of our portfolio metrics, as measured by occupancy, rent growth, leasing spreads, particularly when normalized for CapEx, is illustrative of the stability and quality of our portfolio. From the leasing perspective, as well, asset quality is critical. Retailers make location decisions and far more than simple demographics. Asset quality is also reflected by tenancy and by physical location. Demographics do play a part into finding asset quality, but retailers analyze markets based on trade area, which is irregularly shaped to reflect the variable, such as asset size or critical mass, competition, physical or geographic barriers, transportation, access, et cetera. Therefore from both an operating standpoint and the leasing standpoint, we expect our portfolio to continue to post strong results despite the threat of a weakening economy. With respect to our guidance we are affirming our previous 2008 FFO estimates of $3.95 to $4.05 per share. With respect to individual quarters, there will be some seasonality. Analyst should apply lower weightings to the second and fourth quarter, which should attribute a significantly higher weighting to the third quarter funds from operation, which is when we expect to recognize the largest portions of our transactional income. At this point, I'll open the phone lines to receive your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Christine McElroy from Banc of America. Please proceed.
Christine McElroy: Hi, good morning.
Scott Worstein: Good morning.
Christine McElroy: All of you talked about undercapitalized developers looking for stronger partners on projects, have you added any projects to your pipeline recently that were sourced in this way? And can you provide a little bit more color on how you would underwrite and structure a development partnership like that with original developers in distress?
Scott Worstein: Sure. First we have not added any projects to our pipeline currently under this structured, but we have a number of them that we are evaluating. We've looked at a lot of them a number of them. There is a reason why they are in distress, and that’s not why we want to get involved in them, but we have a number in the pipeline now that looks very promising and pending our gauge of tenant interest at ICSE in Vegas, we would probably be adding some in the second quarter. And regard to the structure of the deals that are all very different, its really -- a lot depends on the capability of the developer and how the developer wants to handle the situation and also depends on how deep the distress is, that the developers is in? What their goal is? If there goal is stay in the ownership cycle, if they want to perform leasing services or the development services or if they are looking to just recoup some cost and try to get out and survive for another day. So we have seen everything from a 50/50 pay/pursue proposal to developers that are willing to subordinate all their interest and all their fees to a 9.5% to 10% return, just to get us enticed to join the project. So a lot of it will depend on the where the developer is in his cycle and what our level of interest is. But it is going to be, there is not going to be a real form in any of these deals. It is gong to be very, very deal specific.
Bill Schafer: I am sorry, Christie I want to add something to what Dan said. I just want to make sure everybody understands our role in those. We really view ourselves as pretty much a bridge for private capital to invest in these projects. It really isn't something we're looking at expand our obligations for construction progress. What we offer is good access to capital that those developers don't have, but we also offer the capital provider, a partner that can step in and complete the project if the private developer basically see his economics evaporate and oftentimes that's where people get into trouble when they come in as financial partners with undercapitalized developers without book of experience and then the developers see his profits evaporate and he is basically willing to walk away and the capital provider is left helpless. So we have done this quite a bit in the past, its been very successful and we've made a lot of money for our joint venture partners in that regard and oftentimes we have had to step in and complete the projects ourselves.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then, on your current ground of building pipeline, what kind of stabilized deals are you projecting and what's your estimate of the spread between yield and market cap rate?
Bill Schafer: We are currently projecting stabilized yields between 9.5 and about 10.25 and our exit cap rate is about 6.5.
Dan Hurwitz: Yeah, I think we are still experiencing in the market in the 6.5 or lower range for the quality of the product we are developing but in terms of underwriting on a go-forward basis to assure that we dealt with the uncertainties in the current market we've underwritten even higher exit cap rates on that.
Bill Schafer: And just to be clear when we quoted those kinds of yields I want you to know that they are fully loaded that backs out higher development fees, which shows up elsewhere in our operating results. It also sets forth a contingency for cost overruns and a structural reserve going forward as well as the vacancy factor going forward and it doesn’t include straight line rents. So those numbers could go all over the place depending on how other people treat those items.
Dan Hurwitz: And is loaded with the call for capital to incorporate the timing and legitimate cost that carries the project.
Christine McElroy: Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christeen Kim from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Christeen Kim: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on the development yields. Has there been any change to your internal expectations on any of your projects in terms of stabilization dates or yields et cetera?
Scott Worstein: After the current projects in the pipeline, there have not been any significant changes. For projects going forward we have changed our underwriting and we are expecting higher yields than we had in the past.
Christeen Kim: Is that just due to the easing on land cost?
Bill Schafer: I think it is partly due to the easing on land cost. It's partly due to a lack of competition in the market and we still do see tenant demand for new development projects, so, while the demand has decreased, supply has decreased more dramatically than the demand and we have been looking at some projects that are creeping back up into the double digits from the outset.
Scott Worstein: The other thing that we're doing in our underwriting, that's different is that because of pressure on commodity prices, we've actually built in, increases in construction cost for the entailment period on the project, rather than looking at what the cost would be today, so in addition to the contingency that we have, we also have a built in, in place an escalator on the construction cost to insulate us from any risk and commodity prices.
Christeen Kim: Great, thanks and just on the distressed opportunities, what could those actually represents in terms of dollars invested by DDR?
Scott Worstein: Well again, I don't think its going to be a significant amount of our dollars invested, I think, at the end of the day, we'll be generating primarily financial and operating promotes on these transactions and we'll probably be providing 10% to 25% at most of the cost of the projects. But in terms of the volume of the project, it could, over the next few years, it could represent several $100 million.
Christeen Kim: Great, thanks, guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup, please proceed.
Michael Bilerman: Hi, Good morning. I we could go you here as well. Can you just talk about how aggressive I guess you will be, I guess in the next couple quarters prior to selling the $500 million of assets you want to sell? How aggressive are you going to be putting a new capital prior to getting those sales done?
Scott Worstein: We are not very aggressive, Michael, I mean I think that we talk about getting various opportunities and that's existent in today's environment. We were really talking about getting a bunch of singles, we are not swinging for the fences. There is no big portfolio transaction in our pipeline and if they were offered to is, I don't think we would consider them. The last thing we are going to do is extend ourselves beyond our capital capacity in the near-term. What we are really doing is pursuing a strategy of recycled capital where we can pull capital allowed at 6%, 7% cap rate range and redeploying it to sort of a immediate double-digit deals, I mean the NDT share repurchase for instances is a great example of something that we can turn on and off, as we choose in relatively right sized amounts. $but we are putting a money out in serious double-digit returns for our shareholders. So those are the types of things we are really talking about rather than anything that's going to catch headlines.
Michael Bilerman: And you talked about this $500 million of sales in the back half of the year, what does that encompass? What are you selling and is that tied in anyway to sort of the other income that you expect to occur in the second half.
Scott Worstein: Yes, it is. I mean significant portion of that are assets that we generate in the merchant building gains that we'll replicate in transactional income from 2007 and the balance of it is essentially what we've always done which is to recycle non-core assets at lower growth rates, so that we can redeploy that capital into higher yields and higher growth opportunity.
Michael Bilerman: And so what’s the development fees. How much in, are those assets already delivered in the portfolio, also out of that 500 how much represents merchant sales?
Scott Worstein: In volume of the 500?
Michael Bilerman: Yes
Scott Worstein: I think it is slightly more than half.
Michael Bilerman: And those assets are already on the book. They are in the core portfolio?
Scott Worstein: Well, they are recently completed developments and qualify for merchant building gain where the work has already been done, the returns are in place and now it is just a matter of executing the exit.
Michael Bilerman: And Ambika had a question as well.
Ambika Goel: If we think about breakdown last year of merchant build up of approximately $0.55 and then promotes of about $0.15 and the expectation is that transactional income will be even with last year. How should we think about the breakdown for 2008 between those buckets?
Dan Hurwitz: I think the promotes would be a bit lower than they were last year. We had a large sale that generated a significant promote last year. I think the merchant build should be relatively comparable, there might be a little bit of an increase in the land sale type stuff to offset some of the difference in the promote.
Ambika Goel: So then on a net basis, how much per share would those two buckets be?
Bill Schafer: We are going to get to a level on a per share basis very comparable to last year's level.
Ambika Goel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
Craig Schmidt: Hi. Thank you. The pick up in transaction of volume in the second half of the year, is this something due to what you see as shift in the marketplace or is it changes that you in DDR, are making yourself?
Scott Worstein: Well first of all, I think it is consistent with what we guided on the last conference call, in terms of timing. So, nothing has changed over the last quarter, but it's certainly more difficult to execute these transactions than it used to be, particularly because the appetite among investors is for core versus value-add, it is less than it was in the past, and that’s something we also discussed on the last call. If we think there is certainly ample of demand to take care of our needs, but it isn't going to be a filling frenzy by any means.
Craig Schmidt: So, it really is in your mind more timing than, less shift in the peoples view where cap rates need to go and so forth?
David Oakes: I guess, a shift from last year is just going to, the relative ease to close transactions in the second quarter to this year, where we would expect more of this in second half. Marketing profit is in place now, meeting to take place, in some cases or in many cases in Las Vegas. And then procedure to close transactions that end up being in the second half of the year. So, I think it’s a change relative to 2007, but not a meaningful change relative to our budget, perhaps the change in pricing relative to 12 months to 18 months ago, but again I don’t think a change relative to where we've expected it to sell various efforts.
Craig Schmidt: Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Habermann from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Jonathan Habermann: Hi, it's Jay, Tom is with me as well. Just following up on Craig's last question, just about the capital markets in, and perhaps what we need to see improve to get your sort of third quarter, obviously the big transaction gains there? I mean do we need to really see an improvement overall in credit market activity? And I guess sort of following on that comments, I mean how far apart today do you think sort of buyer and seller expectations are?
Scott Worstein: First of all, I don't think that any change in the credit market is required for us to achieve our goals, and the asset sales that we are talking about in terms of that volume. There are significant amount of equity capital that is not tied to achieving any sensational leverage on these ventures. And frankly if you look at our deals in the past, most of our joint-ventures are leveraged consistently with how our companies leverage, which is in the 50% to 55% loan to value. So, same as we disclosed, a major financing, secured financing in that range is very attractive pricing. I don't think that is going to be the impediment. I think what you're dealing with and why it takes a little longer in this marketplace is because investors, they are looking at the landscape the same way we are. I mean there is a great talent of opportunities out there, including a tremendous amount of CMBS paper that's in distress, that people think they are going to be able to acquire at a very reasonable prices, and very high yields and there is a lot of vulture activity going around with various plan, around seeing what is going to be available. So people are taking a little bit longer, but there are enough investors out there that are more interested in secured cash flow, just as lenders, that we have worked with. They are more interested in secured cash flow and great sponsorship that will enable us to accomplish our goals. But I think that's the greatest changes, there is a little bit of uncertainty in the market and there is a lot of opportunity in the market. So people with capital are going to be a little slower in making decisions on allocating that capital.
Jonathan Habermann: Well, again the second part of the question, sort of how far apart are buyer and seller expectations at this point?
Scott Worstein: Well, it's very difficult to say, because we haven’t gotten to the point of really having that kind of give and take on these transactions. We’ve just put them on the market basically. I will say, that transaction volume is way down, which indicates that there is greater bid gap than there was in the past among a lot of buyers and sellers. But we haven’t seen any real change in terms of results for the buyers and sellers that have actually made deals.
Jonathan Habermann: Okay. And second question, can you just comment on store closings and what you anticipate perhaps for the balance of the year? Obviously, you did see a pickup in lease termination fee income, but can you comment on what’s happening there? Do you expect more to follow?
David Oakes: Well, I think there will be more to follow. I think there clearly are those tenants in our portfolio that are struggling, and I think we all know who they are. One of the things that we are seeing is tenants struggling in a lot of ways to how best to achieve store closures. Bankruptcy, under the new bankruptcy law is not quite as attractive as it once was. It gives you a lot less flexibility. And unless it's prepackaged, you run a much greater risk of an unsuccessful execution coming out. And a number of these tenants are capitalized by private equity, who really isn’t interested in seeing their equity disappear so quickly. So, I think you are seeing a couple different things. I think we are seeing the impact of ownerships. I think we are seeing the impact of the new bankruptcy law, which has really held back the flow of bankruptcies. Of course if a tenant that's not in bankruptcy closes, then of course we have the benefit of a negotiation where we can get ourselves a significant terminations and again release the space if we have an alternate user. When we don't have an alternate user the tenants are still obligated to stay in the place and pay rent. But I think it would be imprudent of us not to assume that we will see additional store closures, particularly and they are coming into the summer months when cash positions of retailers is at their annual low and so our sales.
Jonathan Habermann: Okay, and Tom has a question as well.
Tom: Hi, guys. If I am not mistaken the breakup between local and national tenants in your portfolio on a revenue basis is about 10% local and 90% national. Can you provide an update as to how the local tenants are faring relative to national tenants?
Scott Worstein: Well, the local tenants are faring worse. If you look at our increase in bad debt, the bulk of that is coming from the local sort of or regional tenants that don't have the whereabouts to sustain extended downturns or having getting squeezed by their vendors and don't have the cash flow to buy the inventory necessary to maintain their volumes. So most of the pressure that we are seeing outside of the big headline names that we all read that are national companies, most of pressure that we are seeing when we look at our bad debts are coming from the local tenants.
Tom: Okay and if I had just a little bit of color on the dynamics of receiving some sort of lease termination fee from a local tenant when they are in a position of financial distress. How much harder is it to receive something from them versus say a national retailer?
Scott Worstein: It's much harder. It is much harder because they have -- generally they have much less capital. In that particular case if you get something, it's usually not overly meaningful and you would do a transaction with them because if you force them into bankruptcy you will get nothing, in many cases. And if you have another use you are better off just getting an underperforming tenant out of your center. These are small shops spaces, so they are not overly impactful on a global basis. So, you're not going get the big numbers from them on terminations, but you will be able to typically get something from them to avoid a bankruptcy, in both cases for the landlord and the tenant. For a local tenant in particular, the chance of recovering something on a bankruptcy is very slim. So, we look at those situations a little differently than we look at the nationals.
Jonathan Habermann: Great, thank you.
Dan Hurwitz: Some times, jus to amplify what we will do with the local tenant is we will ask for sign off letter, where these tenant's space continue to pay rent and we go out in market to space while they are there. So that we can re-tenant the space without downtime and they can avoid a claim against them their personal guarantee. That's really the common way to insulate yourself from risk with respect to small tenants. One of the other things just to follow on that we're seeing, is we're seeing more local tenants that have some interest in staying, but they're just having hard time paying the rent, looking to go on a percentage rent for a period of time at a higher percentage to get them to a period of time where they can start to do sales. June, July are tough months for everybody. So, if you can get them through that period on a rent abatement of some kind and then collect a higher percentage through the holiday season very often we will end up ahead of the game.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line David Toti from Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
David Toti: Good morning. Just, can you guys provide a little bit of color in terms of where you are seeing pockets of regional strength or weakness?
Dan Hurwitz: Sure. Regional strength today is clearly Washington D.C., its is still a very hot market. Very rarely will we meet with a retailers who does not want to have more locations and more geographic distribution than in the D.C. Metro. Clearly, we are seeing continued strength in New England. If you have opportunities because of the right to build issue is so difficult in New England. We have a lot of tenant demand for our product up to the New England states. We are seeing some softness in the South. And we are seeing a little softness in the South West, the Phoenix Metros and in Southern California. A little bit of softness compared to where they were, but again, where they were, the baseline was probably not at sustainable level. So they have become, they have come back to the normal a little bit, which for them would be softness but for us would be a little more normal for the rest of the nation.
David Toti: Great. And then just one last question on the development pipeline. There seems to be no change in the current line up. Have you pushed back any shadow projects, shelved anything? Are you intending to show a little bit less of ICSC, any color on that be useful as well?
Dan Hurwitz: We would probably show a little bit less at ICSC in the sense that there are certain projects, not necessarily because of tenant demand, but because of entitlements that might be pushed to a 2010 opening and its very difficult today to get people focused on 2010 and we are certainly going to want to keep people focused on 2009. So we are going to show a lot of our 2009 and early 2010, but it will be a little bit less on the domestic fund and we'll have a little bit more on the international front. So, on blended basis it will probably be very similar to what you've seen in the past.
David Toti: Great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Michael Mueller: Yeah, hi. With respect to the MDT purchase, why was 6.5% the write amount and I guess over the near term is that reasonable to expect that that number could go up?
Dan Hurwitz: The Australian stock exchange requires filings of substantial ownership interest at a 5%, and then each 1 percentage points above that. And so, the 6.5% or actually 6.6% level represents our recent filing with ASX, but where the stock trades today we continue to see it as an attractive investment alternative.
Michael Mueller: Okay. Switching gears a little bit, in terms of the mix of international versus domestic development deliveries, when you move into 2010, how could that mix shift versus what we see in the supplemental say for 2009?
Scott Worstein: That’s going to shift dramatically, because we will have probably three projects in Brazil and two projects in Russia that will be delivered in 2010. Which would aggregate in dollars probably, this is not our dollars, but in total dollars, close to $400 million to $500 million.
Michael Mueller: Okay. And of that $400 million to $500 million what’s roughly your stake?
Scott Worstein: 50% in Brazil, and 75% in Russia.
Michael Mueller: Okay. Thanks.
Scott Worstein: Yeah and that also going to include Canada. There could be more international including Canada.
Dan Hurwitz: That is more than 11.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Carol Campbell] from Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed.
Carol Campbell: Good morning. In the press release you talked about the acquisitions and disposition in the first quarter, do you know what the cap rates were on those?
Dan Hurwitz: On the small volume of disposition, just the two centers, one of them was a great majority of the $8 million; that was in the 7% cap rate range.
Carol Campbell: Okay. And then, on repurchases, how much did you do in the first quarter and have you done any so far in the second?
Scott Worstein: Share repurchases?
Bill Schafer: No. We have not repurchased any DDR shares during the first quarter or year-to-date in the second quarter.
Carol Campbell: Okay. Thank you.
Scott Worstein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
Jim Sullivan: Good morning. I was confused by a couple of comments, as it relates to the development pipeline. I think you made the comment if I understood that you said correctly that you haven’t pushed back timing of any of your projects, but when I look at the development funding schedule, the numbers seem to tell a different story. At the beginning of the year, your outlook for '08 was about $130 million of funding. During the first quarter, you spent about $20 million. That would suggest you have about 110 left, but the number you show in the first quarter's supplemental half of that $54 million. Can you help me reconcile that where did the other $55 million go?
Bill Schafer: You are comparing fourth quarter supplemental to first supplemental?
Jim Sullivan: On page 42.
Bill Schafer: You are really mixing apples and oranges a little bit, Jim. You are asking when expenditures have been made and comparing that to when deliveries will occur. There isn’t a direct correlation to those two things. Just because expenditures may have fell down slightly doesn’t necessarily mean that the delivery has been pushed back.
Jim Sullivan: I understand the timing, but the amount of funding you expect in ’08 went down by half in a matter of couple of months. It's like something either got pushed back or you’ve taken off the table.
Bill Schafer: While there was certainly an increase in our, I think in this supplement we are saying what’s funded as of March 31, '08 and there was significant funding during the first quarter of '08.
Jim Sullivan: I am looking at the projected funding, the future obligation, we can do it offline if it's all right. It seems like something either got pushed back or taken off.
Bill Schafer: Okay. But I think if you even just look at CIP balance between the end of the year and where we are today it is up a certain amount.
David Oakes: Over a $100 million.
Scott Worstein: That’s between now and the end of the year ago and not what we did in the past.
Jim Sullivan: Yes, I will circle back with you. And then the other topic is, it relates to development that confuse me, when you were talking about 9.5 to 10.25, in think someone said specifically you exclude straight line rents, but when you historically reported your development yields and even in your press release you report a GAAP return. Can you just confirm whether you're talking cash or GAAP and then for your typical project, what might be initial spread between GAAP and cash be?
Scott Worstein: Again we are talking about two of a thing when we evaluate our projects and determine the threshold yield we look at cash on cash return and stabilization unleveraged. When we have to report it and when it comes online then of course we have apply GAAP, which -- what I was trying to explain was that the actual yield that we will be on our books will be higher than the yields that we are quoting for determining our willingness to make an investment.
Jim Sullivan: And what is the typical spread in one of your development projects, your are one between GAAP and cash?
Bill Schafer: The typical spread would be between 75 and a 100 basis points for a power centre or a community center and it is often twice that for a lifestyle center.
Jim Sullivan: Okay that's helpful. And then with respect to the occupancy on your last call, your outlook was flat to down 25 basis points full year so far. Through Q1 you are down 20, are you still looking or you are still projecting flat to down to 25 or something south of that?
Scott Worstein: Now, we're staying where we are because as you look historically at first quarter is usually the weakest quarter because tenants close in the first quarter but they don't open, so historically as you go back we have dropped occupancy in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter and we would expect, to unless again, we have some bankruptcies that don't -- are currently foreseen or budgeted, we would expect our occupancy to remain flat for the year, to down a little bit.
Jim Sullivan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Rich Moore: Yeah, good morning, guys. Dan, aren't small shop rents generally more lucrative than the national or the regional tenants on say a per square foot basis?
Scott Worstein: Yes.
Rich Moore: I am struggling a little bit why you feel so great. Sounds like that's where some of the issues are here in, yet you feel still pretty good about what's going on internally, I mean, I guess you are not that concerned maybe about what's happening with small shop guys?
Dan Hurwitz: The small shops make-up a small percentage of the overall portfolio and of that smaller percentage, only a percentage of that percentage is in the distress that's hitting our books. So I think and to be honest, its much easier to lease at least 2500 square foot shop than it is 40,000 square foot store. So the overall perspective is, yes, small shops pay higher rents and it's also true that the replacement tenant usually pays higher rent than the small shop that vacated. And as a percent of the total from a revenue perspective, it doesn't always add up to a meaningful number.
Rich Moore: Okay, that's good, thank you, but on that I am thinking what does demand like I mean if the small shop guys are hurting something of it in the portfolio, I mean are there guys behind that, that are looking for space, is it kind of what you are seeing?
Dan Hurwitz: There are and there are also smaller national tenants for examples, in the Inland portfolio where we see some softness first from small shops that are used, that we would typically have a national tenant in. So for example there is a big difference when a local sub-shop was out of business and you replace it with subway or a local vitamin store goes out and we replace it with G&C or something like that. So that’s the type of thing that we are doing on a regular basis but overall at tenant demand, if you look at the leasing volume, we were pleasantly surprised with, we were, when you listen to people we are seeing and in Q3 and Q4 of last year and Q1 of this year, we are expecting to see a drop in numbers, and a drop in demand which would have a negative impact on the leasing stretch. And we didn’t see that because we are able to produce a high volume of transactions. And as long as the transaction volumes stays high, we should be able to maintain our occupancy level.
Rich Moore: Okay. That’s good. Thank you. And then, on G&A, where does that go from here? Do you guys have any thoughts for maybe the second quarter or perhaps the year end in total?
Scott Worstein: Yeah. I read your note your note this morning and you guys noted that there was a significant increase in G&A. Obviously that was almost completely related to the fact that we’ve assimilated the Inland portfolio and we have to increase G&A accordingly. What we really look at is the appropriate metric, which is what G&A is a percentage of total revenue, which includes the wholly owned and the joint venture revenue because as you know we get compensated from our joint venture partners to reimburse us for our overhead in managing those assets. And where that exists and where are we expected to be for the year is somewhere in the 4.5% to 4.75% range, which is pretty consistent with historical levels and that does include the outperformance plan that we announced in the last conference call, which is not a huge number but it is a number that registers in that percentage.
Rich Moore: Okay. Good. Thanks, Scott. And then also when you look at your guidance for the year, how do you guys think about LIBOR, to be honest that's just bouncing all over the place and how does that factor into what you guys are thinking?
Bill Schafer: Well, right now obviously, you have one month LIBOR, I think today it is in the 2.9%, it's been down to sub-2.7% and so forth. And right now, we are viewing that is basically in the high twos that’s where LIBOR is, I think in two and three quarter 3% range.
Rich Moore: Okay. Bill, so, you think that for the rest of the year is what gets you to your interest expense?
Bill Schafer: I think, right now probably if you look at everything, you are probably looking at about a two and three quarter number.
Rich Moore: Okay. And the effect of hedges, if I'm correct on this, the effect of hedges goes through the interest expense line, is that right, or does it go through OCI?
Bill Schafer: Yeah, for example we have fixed the number of some of our floating rate debt in prior years, that fixed rate goes through our income statement to the extent that there are adjustments in what those contracts are that would basically go through OCI, because an indicator will be affected through interest going forward. So as of the rates go down there could be to a extent we fixed certain rates, there be an increase maybe in the obligation there which will go through OCI. But then as you pay that interest expense going forward that brings it down, because it runs through our interest expense line item.
Rich Moore: Okay. Very good, thank you guys.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Bilerman from Citigroup. Please proceed.
Ambika Goel: Hi, this is Ambika. What amount of assets are currently on the balance sheet that could generate gains?
Bill Schafer: I mean I would say most of the assets are on the balance sheet.
Scott Worstein: You are talking about merchant build gains..
Bill Schafer: If we look at what's stabilized from the development pipeline over the past several years are going to lease up. Profit in the past several years, there would comfortably the several hundred million dollars, that has stabilized recently that would be eligible this year in addition to some projects potentially that still show up in the current development pipeline if they are going through their final development stage that could also be eligible.
Ambika Goel: If we think about the $215 million, what years did these projects stabilize in?
Bill Schafer: I would say those projects stabilized in the past 12 months to at most 18 months.
Michael Bilerman: What's your policy in terms of how long you'll hold an asset that you delivered or are you going to sell and generate a gain? And how is that processed in terms of when you fist decide you will bring something back and stop depreciating it, just help us to sort of get a grasp around that?
Bill Schafer: Re-accruals would required that an asset has to be held for four years, post its initial stabilization, to be sold and not generate a significantly negative tax impact, through our TRS. There are ways to shorten that period that obviously very large number of companies engage in, but the reality is for our exact sort of development project, there is a multi-quarter or even multi-year stabilization process to get to that final stabilized occupancy before we would view an asset as having completed its development value creation.
Michael Bilerman: And is there a specific level of occupancy that one, that DDR considers asset stabilized?
Bill Schafer: Well, we typically consider an asset stabilized at 95% occupancy. But I think one of the, what Michael just asked, is problematic is a criteria to determine merchant building gain, vis-à-vis whether they are going to depreciate or not, because there are some of our projects come online over a long period of time. They are phased over several years and the project is still a development project, sometimes five years after the first tenant opens. It doesn’t stop becoming eligible for merchant building gains accordingly. I mean, I can think of a great example of that would be our project in Coon Rapids, Minnesota probably took six or seven years from the opening of the first store to last store to fully stabilize that asset. But we still had a significant amount of that asset and the development pipeline lift and we still had land to build out and lease.
Michael Bilerman: Did you take that asset into the core and depreciated in light of…?
Bill Schafer: Part of it, yes, and part of it, no. It depends.
David Oakes: But the gain that was booked was on any case, was relative to an undepreciated basis.
Michael Bilerman: So you are saying right now, you probably have $600 million to $700 million of assets in the core portfolio that could generate gain of which you are going to sell 250 in the back half of the year.
Dan Hurwitz: Yeah. I think we have comfortably several hundred million dollars of assets that if delivered over the past several years we have had initial deliveries and it stabilized in the past year or so.
Michael Bilerman: Does that include any acquisitions you did?
Scott Worstein: It's the acquisition were incomplete at the time that they were acquired than they would. I mean there was a bunch of stuff at JDN that still hasn't been developed and there is a bunch of stuff in Inland that still hasn't been developed. So yes that does include assets like that.
Michael Bilerman: Then how do you decide whether something is merchant build versus development hold and in that does the termination change from initial to…
Scott Worstein: We don't decide that, Michael, until it's been in the portfolio long enough to be an investment asset. I mean we maintain the flexibility to make it a merchant build again as long as it qualifies but sometimes but we also don't maximize our merchant building gains by selling every asset that qualifies for that because that would cause our earnings to be too lumpy. So every year, there is probably hundreds of million dollars of assets that could have been harvested that haven't been, that have moved into the investment category that now it's too late.
Michael Bilerman: Right.
Scott Worstein: That's why you know when you guys asked the questions, we don't keep the running list of this on a quarterly basis in disclosures and what we are really focused on is that when we do our budgets in October, we will look at everything that tell us all that time and then we will choose from among that list those assets that we target to harvest during the coming year to achieve the gains that we really want to achieve during that year. And then during that year there will be projects that are added to the list and projects that will come afterwards.
Michael Bilerman: Why wouldn't you put that list out?
Scott Worstein: First of all I don't think anybody does and it's just something. We are ready to provide more disclosure on these items than anybody in the industry and I think its enough.
Dan Hurwitz: And I think it ends up being a function of the lease-up and what ends up in certain specifically, what's ends up in terms of certain tracts that could be sold to retailers versus lease, and so there are number of items that economically may end up comparable to the company, but it would impact our interest in selling or holding assets. I think our opportunities set on investment side. It also determines our desire to recycle some capital out of recently developed project in some cases or not in other environment.
Michael Bilerman: Just last question, how you are marketing these portfolios? Are you selling the merchant build to 250 as one sort of portfolio and then the non-core stuff in the single assets or in terms of your marketing process?
Dan Hurwitz: Today we are for the most part of marketing individual assets or very small portfolios as the way we see, the way to capture the largest number of potential bidders or buyers based on where the credit market stand today. The smaller loans, $50 million to $100 million loans, on $100 million to, $200 million assets, so that's 50% loan to value is much more available than the $500 million loan, on the $1 billion portfolio despite the exact same coverage ratios and other credit metrics and so I think we want to be sensitive to where the market stands today and end up with a larger volume of smaller transactions.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day."
3,SITC,2,2008,2008-07-25 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Developers Diversified second quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Michelle Dawson. You may proceed, madam.
Michelle Dawson: Good morning. And thanks for joining us. On today's call, you'll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, Bill Schafer and David Oakes. Before we begin, I'd like to alert you that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ maybe found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and filed with the SEC. I would also like to request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott Wolstein: Good morning, everybody. I am pleased to report our earnings results for the quarter. We have reported funds from operations per share of $0.82, which is precisely in line with our guidance; although below the estimates of some sell-side analysts. These results reflect virtually no transactional income. The reported FFO is almost exclusively derived from the current operating income from the core portfolio and our operating metrics continued to be strong and well in line with our expectations. While the other DDR participants on this call will speak at length as to the specifics of these operating results, I would prefer to speak to our operating strategy in the current environment and our view as to what lies ahead for DDR and for our industry. At the outset, I would like to emphasize that although the operating environment for retail faces near term challenges, those challenges are not the same for all landlords. The pressure on the consumers' disposable income from the precipitous increase in energy cost is clearly resulted in a pronounced trend of trading down by the consumer from full-price retailers to value and off-price retailers. Recent sales reports by retailers have demonstrated an undeniable and significant shift in market share from those retailers that typically populates our nation's regional malls to those value retailers that typically populate developers' diversified portfolio. Investors that choose to ignore this trend, do so at their own peril. This shift in market share will not have been evident in recent earnings of various landlords, as there is a significant timing lag before retail distress impacts landlords, but the distress among many of the full-price specialty stores will start to become evident over the next 18 months. Developers Diversified will not be immune from the distress in the economy, but we do believe that our focus on value retail will allow us to be less impacted than many other landlords. Further, our international development initiative will enable us to achieve remarkable returns on capital in markets that are not equally discuss susceptible to the economic problems in our domestic economy. Nevertheless, we, like all other real estate companies, will be forced to operate in an environment of radically reduced availability of traditional funding for real estate by commercial banks, investment banks, and traditional investors in corporate bonds and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Similarly, our business strategy must assume that we will not be an issuer of public common equity at any time in the foreseeable future. We at Developers Diversified have been mindful of these challenges for quite some time and we have adopted significant changes to our investment strategy and our capital market strategy to enable us to navigate successfully through this period of constrained credit. Our strategy will focus on enhancing liquidity, protecting the quality of our balance sheet, maximizing our access to private equity, and concentrating on the investment of our own capital in areas where our returns will be in excess of our cost of capital. While you will hear more details on this call behind this strategy, I would like to highlight the following initiatives for your consideration. We will continue to aggressively sell assets outright and into joint ventures including those asset sales that are necessary to enable us to realize the merchant building gain and our earning guidance for the balance of 2008. And we are in advanced negotiations on a transaction that will accomplish that goal. We will fund the bulk of the capital required to build out our domestic development pipeline through a joint ventures with private equity investors instructions that will adequately compensate our common shareholders with fees and promotes whereby Developers Diversified will receive additional percent share of the value creation to be realized from these projects. We will complete the fund raising for a new value fund that will focus on investing private equity alongside Developers Diversified in developments that have been initiated by private developers who are in desperate need of funding. We have received particularly strong interest from several large foreign institutions, one of which has committed to be the lead investor in this fund. We will proactively address all 2009 debt maturities with new funding as we have done throughout 2008. We currently have addressed all 2008 debt maturities. We will continue to invest internally generated capital, well within our balance sheet capacity in international development initiative where our returns are truly extraordinary and we will explore the potential co-investment in these opportunities only to the extent that such investments will dramatically enhance our investment returns from these opportunities. We will continue to avoid any investment of capital in core portfolio acquisitions as such opportunities simply cannot offer comparable returns to those available from our other investment and development opportunities. We will enhance our scrutiny of all projects in our development pipeline and we will defer or abandon any and all projects that don't meet our pre-leasing thresholds or return thresholds, and we will continue to pursue any and all operating initiatives that will protect and enhance the growth and performance of our core portfolio and company overall, including compensation plans that enhance the alignment of interest of all of the company's key employees with shareholder returns as well as with departmental and company-wide goals and objectives. At this point, I will turn the call over to Bill for his comments on the quarter.
Bill Schafer: Thanks, Scott. I'd like to first highlight a few items from the quarter and then give an update on our current financings, balance sheet position and what we're hearing from our lending partners. With regard to the current quarter's operating results, first, we recognized approximately $64 million of transactional income including fees in the second quarter of 2007, compared to less than $1 million in 2008. As David will discuss shortly, we expect comparable levels of transactional income to occur later this year. Second, the asset sales that occurred late in the second quarter of 2007 make a year-over-year comparison difficult. Late in the second quarter of 2007, we sold nearly $1.5 billion of assets into joint ventures. The revenues and expenses associated with these assets with the exception of depreciation on the Inland assets that were sold continued to be reflected in the 2007 numbers and are not reflected in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement with these assets. There were also a significant number of asset sales that occurred in late June of 2007 that are reflected in discontinued operations. These assets contribute over $8 million of FFO in the second quarter of 2007. Third, the 2008 tenant recoveries were impacted by the finalization of the 2007 common area maintenance true-up calculations. Certain estimates were used to finalize the accrued estimated tenant recoveries in the 2007 year-end results. During the second quarter of 2008, the final common area maintenance billings were processed, resulting in a negative $2.7 million adjustment. This adjustment is non-employing in nature. In addition to the unique guidance just discussed, our core same-store NOI growth was consistent at 2.5%. There has been upward pressure on the company's bad debt expense when compared to recent years. Our bad debt expenses continued to approximate 1.5% of total revenues in 2008, compared to approximately 0.8% for the same time period in 2007. The driver for the increase primarily is due to an increase in the level of financial stress across the small and mid-sized tenants. The operating results of our properties in Brazil continue to perform extremely well, including additional investment in certain assets of approximately $30 million, the portfolio has generated FFO growth of 82% and 69% over 2007 second quarter and year-to-date results, respectively. We have also acquired 62.9 million shares of MDT for $29.3 million, which produced approximately $4 million of FFO in the second quarter, 2008 and included approximately $3 million of income from mark-to-market capital hedging. With respect to funding needs for DDR and our joint ventures, we continue to execute on our strategic plan. We originated approximately $500 million of new mortgage capital and refinanced $275 million of existing mortgage capital year-to-date. We also have signed term sheets on $445 million of refinancing and $40 million of new debt which are expected to close during the third quarter. Moreover, we're looking beyond 2008 to make sure we're appropriately prepared if the current credit market dislocation continues. Our pending deals include three large loans. First, we have a signed term sheet and rate lock for at least $340 million of mortgage debt that will refinance the December maturity of MDT's original IPO debt. The blended pricing on the loan is approximately 6%, approximately 55% to 60% loan-to-value. Second, we have a signed term sheet on our Horseheads, New York development at 80% loan-to-cost and price at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. We should provide proceeds in excess of $40 million, subject to the outcome of pending appraisal. Third, we have a commitment to refinance our Ward Parkway Center in Kansas City which is held by our Coventry II joint venture. In addition, we have R$120 million of long-term Brazil-based debt under negotiation that is a hybrid of construction and permanent financing. All remaining 2008 maturities have extension options which are expected to be exercised, with the exception of approximately $30 million of loans on two Texas developments that mature in November-December 2008, which are currently in discussions with existing lenders and approximately $40 million of mortgage loans with a weighted average interest rate of 4.65% and a loan-to-value of just under 50% that will be repaid with our revolving credit facility. Our 2009 maturities are relatively light, consisting of $275 million of unsecured note issue in January, $120 million of consolidated mortgage debt and $430 million of joint venture mortgage debt of which our ownership interest is approximately $73 million. Of the 2009 maturing joint venture mortgage debt, we have the option to extend over $200 million at existing terms. Our share of the joint venture mortgage debt that is not extendable is $33 million. We've already begun discussions with a variety of banks and lenders about opportunities to meet these maturities and expect to address them early and at the most competitive terms possible. Since our last call, we've continued to find financing opportunities despite the adverse market conditions. Select commercial banks are still providing loans and participations have become more prevalent. [Light] companies remain active, but are clearly focused on the strongest relationship and best projects. Overall, loans are taking more time to close as lenders are employing greater scrutiny and more extensive due diligence. Given this environment, we're obviously pleased to have broad, long-standing relationships with a variety of commercial banks as well as an established track record among many institutional lenders. We're leveraging these relationships to secure the most favorable financing alternatives available. We continue to keep a close eye on our liquidity. We're committed to maintaining our debt level sufficient to maintain our ratings and sustaining adequate cushion relative to our debt covenants. We're well below our total debt threshold of 65%, our secured debt maximum of 40% and comfortably above our debt service and unencumbered asset test. These covenants reflect how our lenders look at our leverage as opposed to simple metrics like debt-to-market cap, which can completely misrepresent a company's true leverage and risk profile. By staying ahead of the curve, and raising capital proactively, I'm comfortable with our current balance sheet position and our outlook for 2009 despite the ongoing dislocation in the credit markets. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Hurwitz: Thank you, Bill and good morning. As I mentioned on our recent conference call, there continues to be a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street with respect to many aspects of our business. Consumer's concerns regarding the health of our economy and its impact on disposable income have caused broad changes in shopping patterns. Clearly, consumers are more price sensitive than ever and patronizing those retailers that offer the best value for non-discretionary goods. As a result, our core retailers are actually doing quite well and are still pursuing new store locations. Wal-Mart is still opening 140 to 150 stores this year and throughout the foreseeable future. Target is still opening over 100 stores a year. TJX, Kohl's, JCPenney, PetSmart, Bed Bath, Dick's Sporting Goods, Barnes & Noble, Staples, Ross and many other national retailers continue to be very profitable and are very focused on external growth. Most tenants have effectively controlled inventory and debt levels and remain on plan with respect to sales. They are also maintaining margins despite somewhat lackluster same-store sales growth. It is important to note that same-store sales results in a cautious inventory environment are somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not a good barometer of overall retail health and certainly not a reliable metric in determining overall financial performance. Simply put, you can't sell what you don't have on the shelves, but you can maintain margin with lower sales combined with prudent inventory control and that is exactly what we are seeing from the vast majority of our key retailers. Weaker retailers, some of which we also have in our portfolio are feeling pressure and will likely continue to experience difficulty in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we anticipate more store closings and bankruptcies and have adjusted our 2008 budget and reserves appropriately. We have experienced these cycles before and have made the necessary adjustments to our leasing and development strategies to accommodate the changes in our operating environment and mitigate risk. In many cases, the loss of the weaker tenant creates a great opportunity to release space at higher rents to a stronger retailer. More importantly, the quality of our property revenue stream is very consistent as it is generally derived from retailers with strong credit profiles under long-term leases with very little reliance on [over-rents] generated by tenant sales performance. Since 2000, there have been numerous tenants whose store closings made headlines, at the times that they were announced. OfficeMax, Eddie Bauer, KB Toys, Regal Theaters, Kmart, Food Lion, Rhodes, HomePlace, Tops Markets, Ultimate Electronics, Winn-Dixie, Zany Brainy and a host of others. Our occupancy and rent growth remained stable despite the historic store closures and challenging retail headlines. I'd like to highlight a few case studies to illustrate what our experience has been when tenants actually vacate. Two of the largest bankruptcies we experienced were HomePlace and Kmart, both of which were among our top ten tenants at the time of their bankruptcies. HomePlace occupied 12 locations in 2001 and represented over $7 million of rental revenue at a time when our portfolio was less than half of its current size. Within 12 months, all the stores were re-leased at rents 26% higher than previously in place. Subsequent to Kmart's bankruptcy in 2002 they closed 18 stores within our portfolio. We re-tenanted 16 locations and received 133% higher revenues. Toys ""R"" Us and Kids ""R"" Us represented another perceived blow to our centers but resulted in an attractive outcome. We have released five of their seven units in their entirety for an 81% revenue increase. With respect to speculation regarding Mervyns potential bankruptcy, we've been monitoring their status closely since the first signs of vendor pressure this spring and we continue to do so. Mervyns has not declared bankruptcy and is current on all rent payments. We acquired 36 of our 38 Mervyns stores in 2005. Notably we bought the first portfolio they sold post LBO and were able to select what we believe are the most attractive locations. Approximately 70% of the assets are based in California including nearly 1 million square feet in and around Los Angeles and over 500,000 square feet in the Bay Area. If our Mervyns locations should become available to release, we believe there will be significant retailer interest in the sites we own, based on their desirable West Coast locations with high barriers to entry, infill locations and strong demographics. Within our core portfolio alone, for example, we've re-tenanted a former Mervyns box in Utah with Ross Dress for Less, DSW and Michaels increasing rental revenues over 1500% after adjusting for TI. I would also like to emphasize that we hold a $25 million letter of credit that we can access if Mervyns files for bankruptcy or if Mervyns defaults and we terminate all the leases. In addition, we hold three other letters of credit aggregating $8 million which we can [tap] if they default on individual leases. The combination of quality locations, and significant credit enhancement coupled with already known tenant interest clearly minimizes any risk we have should Mervyns file Chapter 11 or Chapter 7. Notwithstanding the potential upside achieved through re-tenanting, we're analyzing the near term financial impact from the bankruptcies of Steve & Barry's, Linens 'N Things and Goody's. If each of these tenants completely ceased operations which is not expected to be the case and we were unable to re-tenant half of their stores which we clearly don't expect, based on our assessment of the quality of the real estate and our track record in past some of the tenant bankruptcies, we would still only suffer the following reductions in FFO on an annual basis until we were able to find replacement tenants. If Linens 'N Things close half their stores in our portfolio we would lose $3.7 million of rent of $0.03 of FFO. Similarly if Goody's close half their stores we would lose $2.6 million or $0.02 of FFO. And lastly if we assume the same for Steve & Barry's we would lose $1.5 million or a $0.01 of FFO. We are mindful of the current environment and are closely monitoring the relative strength of the tenants in our portfolio. We feel confident in our ability to create substantial value for our company and shareholders even in these difficult times. Expecting that there are more store closings likely to occur this year, we continued to be very proactive in our leasing strategy to reflect a much more conservative stance. We already addressed most of our 2008 renewals earlier in the year. During the second quarter, we focused on maintaining future occupancy by aggressively pursuing new lease commitments within reasonable margins on pricing. As a result of this effort, we signed a record number of new leases despite a very difficult operating environment. While our 9% blended rental rate increase is below our historical average, we strategically decided to focus on transactional volume, succeeded in that goal and we're still able to increase our average square foot rate across the portfolio by $0.25 a foot. This effort will have a very positive effect on our projected occupancies for 2009. Just to give you a little flavor of who is active in Q2, we signed new leases in our operating portfolio with Michael's, Hobby Lobby, David's Bridal, Justice and Jos. A. Bank. In our development portfolio we signed 100,000 square feet of new deals including leases with tenants such as Petco, Barnes & Noble and Ulta. in addition, Macy signed 103,000 square foot lease earlier this week joining J JCPenney and Sports Authority as a third anchor in our Nampa Idaho development. The Macy's deal has created considerable leasing momentum and we have another 50,000 square feet of leases near execution and over 100,000 square feet of letters of intent that are progressing. We have tenant commitments for additional locations from Target, Barnes & Noble, [Ulta], Bed Bath Anna's Linens and HH Gregg and many other stores for additional locations at our developments. Just this past week in addition to Macy's, we have executed leases with Kohl's and J.Crew as well. Overall, we have commitments on over 80% of our 2008 wholly-owned development deliveries and 66% for 2009. Within our JV developments, we have comparable levels of tenant interest with 77% committed for 2008 deliveries. We continue to make significant strides with respect to our international investments and developments and I would like to provide a brief overview of our platform and the investments we've made to date. As with our domestic operations, we always seek investment opportunities with the most attractive risk-adjusted returns. We have explored many international markets, but we've chosen to selectively invest where we believe the greatest value creation opportunities exist and are focused on success in a few markets rather than feeling the need to be everywhere. We target countries with economies that are growing at faster rates than the US and we identify strong local operating partners with an increased focus on retail real estate development expertise and trustworthiness. Last, we always try to leverage our full strengths of leasing, development and tenant relationships in all of our dealings and that is no different internationally. With respect to our investment in Brazil, I am pleased to report that the portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well. Economic and real estate market conditions in Brazil remain strong as evidenced by the 5.8% economic growth that occurred during the first quarter of 08 which was the fastest first quarter growth in over 13 years. Consumer spending and retail sales growth continues to remain robust as well with an 11% growth rate in year-to-date retail sales recently reported. Within our portfolio, retail sales have increased 13% year-to-date with commensurate same-store NOI growth, which is consistent with what we've seen in the portfolio since our initial investment nearly two years ago. We continue to see intense demand among retailers for space within our existing assets as well as for our development projects. And with the healthy sales growth we're seeing in our portfolio, rental rates are growing as well. With respect to our portfolio, we have seen a substantial increase in the value since our initial acquisition in the fall of 2006. This is due to a variety of factors including tremendous cap rate compression, the immense demand for retail real estate in Brazil, robust economic conditions, a favorable currency exchange rate environment, and our ability to drive NOI at our existing assets. Based on current market conditions, we are seeing development yields in the low to mid-teens while stabilized assets continue to trade below an 8% cap rate on a consistent basis. This compares to our initial acquisition cap rate of over 11%, based on third-party valuations by Cushman & Wakefield. Based on those valuations, with reflect to factors I just mentioned, our investment has increased in value by $190 million, more than $1.50 per share. This amount includes none of the considerable value creation we expect to realize through our development of the shopping center that is currently underway in Manaus or the additional development opportunities we expect to secure in the future. We made substantial progress at our three development projects in Brazil and Russia as well. Our developments located in Londrina and Overland are scheduled to deliver in 2010. And our development in Manaus is scheduled to open in the first half of next year; obviously those are all in Brazil. To date, we have nearly 75% tenant commitment for space in Manaus with anchor leases signed with national retailers such as Marisa, Renner and C&A. To the end of the second quarter, we've invested approximately $200 million in Brazil and have a commitment to invest an additional $100 million over the next two years. Now in Russia, our developments in Yaroslavl, and Togliatti continue to progress. We're currently seeing development yields in the low double-digits which is well above cap rates on stabilized assets. Both of our projects are expected to deliver in 2010. To date we've invested approximately $50 million of the total commitment of approximately $260 million. We continue to work with our partner ECE to explore additional opportunities. Our investments in Canada to date consist of development projects, which include three with Rice Commercial Group and two with Holborn Property Investments, all of which are in the Greater Toronto area. The five projects upon completion will aggregate 2.4 million square feet with expected total costs of $530 million with expected deliveries commencing in 2011. With incredibly high barriers of entry in the Toronto market and robust retailer demand, we are extremely pleased with the momentum that each of our projects currently enjoy. Our success internationally has attracted the attention of both retailers looking to expand overseas and private capital interested in co-investment opportunities. We continue to work very closely with Wal-Mart, for example, which is evaluating locations in Brazil and Russia as well as other countries. With the emergence of the reais-based debt market and with potential JV partners, there are numerous opportunities to continue to seek out attractive investment opportunities in Brazil and other markets in a prudent and strategic manner. As our international investment platform continues to evolve, our international developments could come to represent 70% of our total development investments in the future. We do not expect our international investments to represent 70% of our total asset base, as was erroneously reported recently in the press. That all being said operationally we are very focused on navigating the choppy domestic environment and the more robust international market with the appropriate care to mitigate risk and maximize value. We continue to expedite new and renewal leases, staying extremely focused on controllable occupancy levels. We have also continued to phase our developments to avoid capital expenditure on un-leased space, raise our return thresholds on new projects which will reduce the expansion of our pipeline, market space anticipated but not yet rejected in bankruptcy to limit downtime and continue to meet with all of our retailers to understand the ever-changing market and the potential impact on our portfolio. When you cut to the chase the story is still pretty simple. Leasing volume is still strong even though there is some obvious pressure on pricing. The vast majority of our tenants are still growing externally. Our development pipeline in progress is substantially pre-leased and if projects are not pre-leased going forward they won't get built. Our same-store NOI is very solid and average place rent continues to grow. Our exposure to bankruptcy is known to date is very manageable and we feel comfortable with our anticipated future exposure. And international continues to progress regarding high value creation growth and opportunity. While we are very cognizant of the conditions in which we operate, it is important to see the conditions for what they are and not let the abundance of negative pressures cloud the numerous positives that occur in every challenging environment. I would now like to turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Dan. In today's environment, we're approaching all capital allocation decisions more selectively than ever. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities created by the ongoing capital market's dislocation. While potential returns from some of these investments are better than we've seen in many years, we remain very focused on conserving capital and separating our investment decisions from our financing decisions. Clearly, we're very focused on completing our financing plan for new investments and will not simply rely on our lines of credit. Given today's environment in which there are a variety of competing investment opportunities coupled with more stringent underwriting and approval processes, the capital partners we're working with are naturally slower to move. These investors include both domestic and international institutions which are significantly less dependent upon the debt market and continue to be interested in the secure cash flow generated by our sort of assets. Transactional activity remains subdued, but we are getting relatively better visibility on these asset sales and our negotiations continue. Based on feedback from the market, we expect to reach or exceed our goal of asset sales at pricing consistent with market trends. In the 6% cap rates for higher quality assets and 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher for non core assets. Margins on sales of recently developed assets should be between 20% and 40% relative to our undepreciated development costs. Although overall transaction volume is down relative to recent years, sales are occurring. Year-to-date, we've closed $27 million in non-core asset sales, of which $19 million sold during the second quarter. Cap rates on the assets sold and under contract averaged about 7%. Relative to our core portfolio, these assets are generally smaller, more mature, and lower growth. Buyers range from local individuals to multibillion dollar REITs with motivations ranging from the high cash flow opportunistic to tax-driven. They've generally been financed with mortgage debt at 60% to 70% loan-to-value. We currently have over $80 million of asset sales under contract and another $100 million subject to letter of intent. We continue to move forward in negotiations with potential investors for our recently developed assets and are in negotiations with several parties on several large additional transactions. We have nearly $1 billion of merchant building product at or near stabilization representing over $180 million of potential gains, net of our deferral due to retained ownership. From an investment perspective, we talked for several quarters about the number of co-investment opportunities we see with smaller developers. This is a very attractive opportunity to increase our returns and actually shrink the dollars we have invested in development while still participating in projects. We're primarily interested in participating in the development of large scale community center assets that are fully entitled and have some level of pre-leasing. At the same time, we're receiving interest from private capital for the precise sort of risk profile and returns that these projects generate. Obviously, our opportunity to capture this market disconnect is divest these projects diligently, identify the best investments on a risk-adjusted basis and structure attractive investment vehicles that bridges the gap between those that are long capital and those that are long opportunity. This approach allows us to preserve our precious capital and increase our investment returns while exceeding the return requirements of our capital partners. We also continue to see the purchase of MDT units as a compelling investment because of the significant discount that the market currently assigned to the stock. We currently control over 6% of the units and when legally permissible would expect to continue to buy units in the market. This position clearly aligns our interest with those of all MDT unitholders. Moreover, given current market pricing, we can capture immediate and outsized returns on our investment. We also like the effective increase in our ownership of some of the highest quality assets in our entire sector. Much of MDT share price decline can be attributed to investor's concern regarding its balance sheet, which we believe were substantially addressed in a press release issued by MDT last night. First, with the June 30th revaluations completed, MDT continues to be in compliance with all of its debt covenants. Second, with respect to near term debt maturities as Bill described earlier, the trust has agreed to turns, received approval and rate locked the refinancing of its $340 million debt facility originally due to expire December 2008. Third, MDT has agreed to improve its debt covenants in order to provide the trust with greater balance sheet flexibility going forward. Fourth, the trust announced it's in negotiations to dispose of select property assets which will further improve the trust liquidity. We believe that these announcements may relieve some of the pricing pressure on MDT's stock and we remain committed to its long-term success. Before I turn the call back over to Scott, I want to discuss some changes we've made in the development section of our quarterly supplemental. In response to feedback from investors regarding additional disclosure, we've added a table detailing our land held for development. This new table provides greater color on the non-encumbering assets that we own and allows us to reserve the space in the development in process schedule for projects that are actually under construction today while still disclosing what our next starts may be. During the quarter, we commenced construction on projects in Norwood, Massachusetts and Guilford, Connecticut and added to our landholdings in Russia and Canada as you'll see reflected in these schedules. Now, I'll turn the floor back to Scott for his concluding remarks.
Scott Wolstein: Thanks, David. Before I open the line to questions, I'd like to reiterate some of the most important items that we discussed this morning. First, our balance sheet remains a top priority. We continue to proactively pursue new financing opportunities to ensure a strong balance sheet position throughout the remainder of 2008 and throughout 2009. As a result of these dedicated efforts, we are very comfortable with our ability to meet all of our future debt maturities and development funding requirements. Second, we're actively marketing dark and vacant space from recent bankruptcies and store closings. As Dan described, we've been down this road many times before and have demonstrated the stability of our assets and our ability to create value through re-leasing. Third, we're committing less balance sheet capital to early stage domestic development. And lastly, while we're seeing many new and attractive investment opportunities, we have adjusted our underwriting assumptions to ensure that any new capital investment must be more stringent return requirements that address all potential risks appropriately. The tougher it becomes in the broad market, the more attractive the stability of our asset class becomes. The consistency and cash flows generated by long-term leases to high quality tenant base requiring comparatively low ongoing capital investment and operating most compelling value proposition to consumers to insulate us very well from the volatility of the broad economy. As I have said before, I am comfortable affirming our 2008 FFO guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per share and we expect to have considerable progress on our transactional activity to report in advance of our next conference call. At this point, we will open the line to receive your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed sir.
Michael Bilerman: Good morning, (inaudible) is also here with me as well. David, I want to go back to a comment you made on the merchant development where you talked about having $1 billion dollar pipeline, $180 million of net gain. In the last quarter call in our discussion, you talked about a few hundred million of merchant development. And just going back over history, I don't know if you've even developed the $1 billion to have that sort of inventory. So, I'm sort of scratching my head a little bit to what encompasses $1 billion of merchant development in your books?
David Oakes: Well, given the conversations we've had previously, we've refined our methodology for making sure that we do have that pool identified. And that pool at current market values of stabilized or nearly stabilized developments has a market value in excess or right around $1 billion currently and again, relative to current market pricing we would expect even net of taxes and net of the gain we deferred due to our continued ownership would think that the gain is recognizable for this over the next year or several years, if we chose to sell all those assets would be in excess of $180 million.
Michael Bilerman: What changed from last quarter where you thought it was only a few hundred million dollars?
David Oakes: I think last quarter we had spoken specifically about our plans for calendar 2008 as opposed to the entire scope of recently developed or nearly stabilized assets that would be eligible for sale at a considerable gain relative to our cost basis.
Michael Bilerman: And this is all in the core portfolio or some of this is JV?
David Oakes: A few of these would be partially owned projects but a majority of that would be within the core portfolio.
Michael Bilerman: I really think we need some disclosure. This is well over 10% of the company's assets, its north of $1 billion. And I think just understanding where and how you're booking the gains is very important for shareholders and analysts to understand. Separate from that, can you just walk through the same-store NOI, was up 2.5% this quarter and occupancy was down 40 basis points, the reimbursement rate was 77% versus 86% last year, the NOI margin was 70% versus 72%. OpEx was higher. And so I'm just trying to piece it together, if you have all those downward movements, how is same-store NOI up?
David Oakes: Well, on the merchant building side of it, I think we understand your point. A great majority of it exists in disclosure from the past several years in our development schedule from our supplemental and then I'll leave the same-store NOI question in terms of the calculation to Bill.
Bill Schafer: I also want to correct you, Mike. $1 billion represents less than 5% of our assets, not over 10%. We've managed $22 billion in assets.
Michael Bilerman: For your share, and maybe there's a difference between what your share is?
Bill Schafer: Our wholly-owned portfolio alone is over $12 billion. Our assets are considerably more than what you just said. Maybe we have different idea of value but that's clearly far less than you think it is. And what you're talking about vis-a-vis in the last call and this call are apples and oranges. We talked about merchant building assets we had determined that we would sell and that's roughly half of what is available to be sold. For instance, we have a very large asset that's well over $100 million in Miami, that we determined not to sell at this point and it was not included in the numbers that we cited on last conference call, but in terms of what we have capacity to do, it would be included. We've also made progress on developments that were in progress that are now nearing completion that could be sold because they have greater visibility on the NOI for instance, projects that we have in Homestead, Florida, Chicago, Illinois, San Antonio, Texas, Horseheads, New York. There are lots of projects that are added to that pool as the year goes on. So, there's nothing inconsistent at all vis-à-vis what we said on the last call and what we said today. We know exactly what we have. I think we know it better than you do. And obviously when we disclose the gains, you will see exactly what they are, where they came from as we have in every year. We've never yet failed to deliver on those transactional income items when we said we would and this year will be no exception.
Michael Bilerman: It's the number one question we get, Scott, constantly of where is that pool of assets? What does it encompass? Where do those gains come from? And that's where I think there's a difference and so you're not going to get credit for being able to generate those gains, if people don't feel comfortable where they're going to come from. So, I think that's part of the disconnect that the Street is feeling relative to your merchant build.
Scott Wolstein: Well, I think that's a fair comment. We will discuss internally whether we want to expand disclosure in that area to give that greater visibility. But I do think after 15 years of operating as a public company and delivering every single quarter on our promises, that we deserve a little bit of benefit of the doubt and credibility when we say something and people are suspecting that we're being disingenuous which is somewhat insulting to be quite honest with you.
Bill Schafer: With regard to the same-store NOI, Michael, as you mentioned, actually as I indicated in my remarks, during the quarter we did have an adjustment relating to the 2007 year-end recoveries which negatively impacted the current quarter's recoveries, I think which you indicated were about 77% or so.
Michael Bilerman: Right.
Bill Schafer: Adjusting for that number, you're going to be up in the low to mid-80s I think, consistent with historic amounts. And for this year too, we've included our operations in Brazil which are really performing very strong, down there from the same-store NOI perspective and the portfolio really is operating consistent with how it has in the past. And, again, Brazil is really showing some significant growth in the international.
Dan Hurwitz: And per our historic definition of same-store NOI at this point, we have a same-store pool that includes a broader base of assets including Inland and including the Brazilian operations and have included Puerto Rico for several years. So it's consistent with our methodology overtime to include assets once they've been in the portfolio for a period of time.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christine McElroy with Banc of America. Please proceed ma'am.
Christine McElroy: Hi, good morning. I'm just following up on the leases on the 36 Mervyns stores you bought in 2005, are all of the stores under one master lease, such that if they wanted to close a store or amend some of the terms on a lease, it would impact all of their stores and they would have to amend the entire master lease?
David Oakes: No, there's not a master lease but there's a cross-collateralization in our favor so that in the event that there's a default on one lease we can choose to default them on all the leases, but it doesn't work the other way.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then you said you have a letter of credit of $25 million?
David Oakes: That's correct.
Christine McElroy: Okay. And then my second question, David, you talked about the non-core assets that you have under contract or letter of intent. What kind of cap rates are you projecting based on your negotiations, and is it similar to the 7% you talked about on your recent asset sales?
David Oakes: Yes, it's very similar, both for the $80 million under contract as well as the $100 plus million that is subject to letter of intent behind that.
Christine McElroy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lou Taylor with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed, sir.
Lou Taylor: Hi, thanks, good morning. David, in terms of the sales that are under discussion, do you have enough visibility to get a sense for when they're likely to occur over the second half? Are these fairly imminent or are these are things that are going to close to the end of the year?
Dan Hurwitz: Let me answer that, Lou. With respect to the merchant building asset sales vis-à-vis the non-core asset sales, we expect that to go under contract in the third quarter, maybe close in the third quarter. That part of it I'm not sure about. We'll probably be able to provide guidance in advance of the third quarter conference call as to where it would fall between Q3 and Q4. David would have a better handle on the non-core assets.
David Oakes: The non-core asset sales, a larger number of smaller transactions that will close spread between the third and fourth quarter where everything's progressing, but it's clearly a deal environment where everything moves a bit more slowly than the traditional pace.
Lou Taylor: Okay. And then second question, just pertains to the international development pipeline. I mean, what are your expectations for starts for the second half and which projects were kind of which country do you think they'll occur in?
Dan Hurwitz: Its certainly the asset in Yaroslavl in Russia will start in the second half of 2008, Togliatti maybe late 2008 or early 2009. In Brazil there are three projects in the pipeline that haven't started construction. Maybe one of them will start late 2008, but more likely they're all 2009 starts. I don't think that any of the Canadian projects will start until 2009.
David Oakes: 2009, fall of 2009.
Lou Taylor: Okay last question is for Bill. In terms of your debt maturities balance this year and maybe looking into '09 next year, can you give us a flavor of the sense of the type of debt they are? In other words, are the CMBS loans which you'll have to replace with new capital versus maybe bank or life company debt that you can maybe get an extension on without actually doing a brand-new financing?
Bill Schafer: Again, as I indicated, with regard to the joint venture, there's almost half of that that is subject to extensions that would be available to us. With regard to DDR's portfolio, there is $275 million of public debt that we would have to repay and then there's I think in the neighborhood of $120 million, $130 million of various mortgages throughout. And those a lot of times we would just pay off because those were existing mortgages that were assumed in conjunction with acquisitions and so forth and they're kind of spread throughout the year. So really, the only significant one that we have in really '09 is the $275 million of the public debt.
Lou Taylor: Great. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed sir.
Jay Habermann: Here with, [Johan] on my team as well. How you decide, you did maintain guidance for the full year and I'm just curious, sort of, zeroing in on obviously the transaction based income, but your sense that the market has slightly picked up at least a little bit. You're really banking on obviously sales really falling in the latter half of the year.
Dan Hurwitz: Jay, that's exactly what we guided before the year began and in terms of the most likely transaction that is in negotiation on the merchant building side, it really is a more of a joint venture, a sale of assets into a joint venture which has always been our preference versus trading out our trophy assets in all our sales. Those transactions take a little bit longer to document. There is a lot more to negotiate and we're exactly on track as we guided even last October. We were quite clear that it was our expectation that the transactions would occur in the second half of 2008. So, from our standpoint, although we certainly recognize that there seems to be some discomfort or lack of patience among investors in this regard, nothing has occurred to change our views that things will happen exactly on the schedule that we telegraphed on each call over the last three call probably.
Jay Habermann: Right, I think just given the fact that it's roughly $0.50 of your full year number, still it's certainly the potential that some of that could roll into 2009?
Dan Hurwitz: I really don't expect that, no.
Jay Habermann: In addition, could you just comment on the private equity fund that you mentioned, how far along are you in those discussions and how large could that fund be? What sort of interest would you take?
Dan Hurwitz: We're targeting $500 million in equity. We've received commitment from a lead investor for roughly 40% of that. And we're in advanced discussions with several more. We would expect that fund's first closing to happen late 2008 or early 2009. The challenge quite frankly has been matching up the deep interest we have overseas with enough domestic investors to give the foreign investors domestically controlled private REIT for tax purposes. As you would imagine, the pace of commitments from domestic investors is a little bit slower than it is from overseas investors. So we have several large domestic pension funds that are doing their work and due diligence. We have favorable indications from the consultants that they rely on with respect to this fund. So, we feel pretty good about having this thing closed late this year early next year.
Jay Habermann: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed, sir.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you. There were three projects that were on your wholly-owned consolidated JV development chart that aren't on this. I was wondering if you could tell me why this fell off, two were in Tampa and one was in Raleigh.
Dan Hurwitz: I believe as we increased our development disclosure and added this category, that more clearly reflects the land that we hold, we believe that each one of those projects that were effectively land or improved land or land where that it come from Inland where a very, very small portion of the project, generally one or two outparcels had been developed, but had not been under construction by DDR in terms of any level of us adding vertical improvements. We thought with the expanded disclosure that those projects were more appropriately reflected in the land schedule and that's the way they've been thought about and treated and invested internally at DDR.
Craig Schmidt: So, more of a change in reporting than actual status of those projects?
Dan Hurwitz: The status of those projects has not changed to reflection of how we disclosed them, I think more appropriately currently in the supplemental package.
Bill Schafer: Craig. I think it's important to understand that what happens when we engage in a large acquisition as we did with Inland, as we did with JDN, You inherit some cats and dogs that are actually development projects that maybe are a little bit different than the type that you might initiate yourself and then you go through a little decision metrics as to is it worth pursuing the development or should we just sell it. And I think all of these assets fall in that category. These are all part of the Inland portfolio that we're just trying to rationalize what's the best outcome for DDR. None of them are projects that really fit the profile of something we would have engaged in ourselves from the ground up.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And then one other question, on the MDT vis-a-vis your 6.7%. How high would you feel comfortable taking that ownership?
Dan Hurwitz: We're obviously subject to the securities laws that anyone else is that have certain costs associated with one's ability to participate in open market purchases. Outside of that, I think at recent valuation levels, we see extraordinary value in the shares and would continue to purchase them at these levels, subject to securities limitations, both regarding when we are allowed to participate in the open market, as well as the maximum ownership stake that any party can acquire before making a full tender offer.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Carroll Campbell] with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed ma'am.
Carroll Campbell: Good morning.
Dan Hurwitz: Good morning.
Carroll Campbell: I just had a question on G&A, I think on your last call you had a goal of having G&A stay around 4.5% to 4.75% of revenue. I noticed it was higher in the quarter. When do you expect to get it down to that point?
Dan Hurwitz: Actually, I think it's right in line there.
Carroll Campbell: Okay.
Dan Hurwitz: It's when you include all the revenues of the joint ventures which we manage.
Bill Schafer: When you include all the total revenues, it came in at 4.6%.
Carroll Campbell: Okay. I didn't look at it that way. Thank you.
Dan Hurwitz: Sure.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed sir.
Michael Mueller: Thanks, hi. A couple of development questions first. Can you comment on the cost of the Brazil project? It looks like it went up in the quarter without an increase in square footage, and on Ukiah, that was scaled back. Is that a phasing or is that permanently going to be a smaller project?
David Oakes: Well, first, in Brazil, our project in Manaus now very advanced through the leasing process and development process. A portion of that is a fundamental increase in pricing. It's a function of the boom that's going on in Brazil, the exact reason that we want to have product, an additional product there. And so we've seen our developments costs in local currency terms, increase by about 7%. On the other side of that, now that we're north of 75% leased for the project, we've seen lease rates come in about 10% higher than our original projection. So, on that side of it I think the yield is only increasing as the overall strength of the economy down there has contributed more to rental growth than it has to construction costs, but it's certainly increased both sides. The second part of it relates somewhat to a methodology change in the way that we have disclosed the cost in US dollars. I think initially we thought it would show less volatility and show more clear picture of the project, if we locked the currency rate from our original investment in Manaus. So, we'd eliminate certain quarterly volatility if the currency was moving back and forth, but at this point, I think we've realized that the meaningful one way move in Brazilian currency versus the US dollar, we want to more appropriately reflect what the current cost would be, even though many of those dollars were invested at a prior exchange rate. So, taking our original pro forma cost, increasing it by the 7% fundamental cost increase that I referenced earlier and applying current 1.57, 1.58 exchange rates get you to the current number. So, the great majority of the change there is simply a foreign exchange rate change which again doesn't have an impact in any negative way on the project yield and all in, on our investment now in US dollars where the total project cost is roughly $120 million, we expect the yield north of 15% on that project.
Scott Wolstein: Another way of looking at it is what investors seem to interpret as an increase in cost was actually an increase in value, because the project is actually being funded primarily through internally generated cash flow in Brazil in reais and from debt borrowed in Brazil in reais. And the costs that we're investing in reais is just worth more in dollars, because the reais is worth more than it used to be against the American dollar. So what people mistakenly looked at as dramatic increase in cost was actually an increase in value of the investment.
Michael Mueller: Okay. And David, you mentioned about buying MDT stock or the units, because it's pretty cheap. Can you turn the tables a little bit and talk about your own stock in this environment? How you think about that as investment opportunity, balance sheet considerations, et cetera?
David Oakes: I think we absolutely believe that at current prices our stock represents a very attractive investment alternative. We balance that against the fact that we are making our balance sheet a very high priority and making sure that we are in very strong financial condition to weather whatever existing storm may be out there and so we think of those two items together. We do have additional approval for additional share repurchase and I think it's absolutely something we consider at these levels, especially as we advance through and continue on a daily basis to get more clarity on the asset sales that we're progressing through in the proceeds that we'll recognize from those.
Michael Mueller: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of with [Palone Melgiri] with Wells Fargo. Please proceed, sir.
Palone Melgiri: I'm sorry. Somebody already asked my question. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Kity Wong] with Train, Babcock Advisors. Please proceed.
Kity Wong: Could you just quantify for me in order to meet your guidance for the year, for FFO, how much transaction you actually have to do in the second half of the year? And also what is your dividend expectation for 2008? Thank you.
Bill Schafer: The transactional portion of our guidance is in the $0.50 to $0.60 range out of the total guidance of $3.95 to $4.05, so to put that in dollar that ends up being in the $55 million to $70 million range of transactional volume or of gains from transactional activity.
Kity Wong: So in the sales dollar term, what would that be?
Bill Schafer: If we apply the roughly 20% margin that we've guided to and on the low end of what we've experienced historically, you'd be in the $250 million to $350 million range for merchant building sales to recognize those gains.
Kity Wong: And your dividend expectation for 2008?
Bill Schafer: Dividend expectation for 2008, we've had a consistent policy of revising the dividend at the beginning of the year when the Board of Directors makes that decision and that dividend for now has been set at $0.69 per quarter, that's been paid for the first two quarters of 2008 and historic policy would be what you would expect to see for the remainder of 2008.
Kity Wong: Is it too early to comment on your expectation for 2009 at this point?
Scott Wolstein: Yes, we complete our budgeting for 2009 in October. And traditionally speak to that on our last conference call.
Kity Wong: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please proceed, sir.
Michael Bilerman: Thank you. Scott, you talked in your opening comments about two funds. One was for the broken development deal. I think you also mentioned raising a potential fund for existing developments.
Scott Wolstein: Now, that would be a fund, Michael. We're really looking at that as discrete asset joint ventures. We really couldn't do that as a fund and I'll tell you why. In order to attract private capital in a fund scenario, we really can't cherry pick assets. We would really have to give them sort of an optionality on everything we do from a development standpoint and we're not prepared to do that. So what we do on the development side from our wholly-owned portfolio is we enter into discussions with potential private equity joint venture partners on specific development opportunities on a discrete basis and not on the discretionary fund basis.
Michael Bilerman: And would that be for existing developments that you already have under way or this is for new developments out of your land bank or new developments that you find?
Scott Wolstein: We have basically about seven or eight projects we've identified and entered into discussions with investors on. About three of those will start in 2008 and four of them will start in 2009.
Michael Bilerman: And that's the existing land you have?
Scott Wolstein: It's existing land that we either own or have under option and typically we would bring in the investors at the stage where the project is fully entitled, 50% pre-leased and ready for a construction loan such that we could mark up the project at the front end and recognize some gains when the investor comes into the deal.
Michael Bilerman: What sort of stake would you go down to?
Scott Wolstein: Well, we would go down to as little as 10%, but our share on the upside could be as much as 50%. Typically, the way those deals are structured, we co-invest on a 80-20, 90-10 basis from capital. We have pro rata distributions up to cash flow prep and then above that prep, we have a waterfall that maybe starts at 20% and goes up to as high as 50% of the upside. So, the goal on those joint ventures is to basically access most of the capital from our partners but, grab as much of the upside as we can after they get their returns and investors today are targeting IRRs from that kind of activity in the high teens to up to maybe 20 and on a project that you can bring in, anywhere north of an 8% return on cost, which is well below our threshold, which allows us for front end markup and you can sell on completion let's say a seven cap. It's very easy to generate IRRs well in excess of that.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. And then on the sort of the value add, the value funds to go after the broken development, how far along are you in identifying properties or is it sort of a blind pool upfront?
Scott Wolstein: We've created a department within the company that does nothing but that and we've had dozens of projects identified. We've had probably as many as 10 meetings with private developers recently to go over specific projects. The challenge there, Michael, is really to be quite candid, is a lot of these developers are in trouble because the returns they were willing to accept were kind of low. So, the decision we need to make in some of these is do we want to do a deal with the developer or do we want to do a deal with the bank and that's kind of how we look at this opportunity and I think some of the best opportunities. There are plenty of opportunities right now to do the deal with the developer. Some of the best opportunities might be those that we wait for when we can deal with the lender.
Michael Bilerman: Another thing you mentioned in your opening comments was new comp plans; sort of align interest of your employees to stockholders. How far along you are in terms of putting in new comp plans and what sort of value and impact to earnings would it be?
Scott Wolstein: Well, the major plan that was already announced, which was a supplemental co-equity plan that we announced I think last quarter…
Michael Bilerman: Last year.
Scott Wolstein: Actually, last year I guess we announced it. But what I was referring to really wasn't so much a new compensation plan as much as what we've been doing internally which is establishing very specific operating metrics, both on a departmental and individual basis, so that the employees' bonuses and long-term incentive comp is very specifically tied to quantitative or qualitative metrics that are established in advance so that employees are really more aligned, if you will, with the goals that we have for them to achieve not just on a company basis but also on very specifically on a departmental basis.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. And just on the bad debt expense, is that in your same-store NOI or out of it?
Bill Schafer: It's not reflected. We have a definition actually in our supplement where we slow the calculations of same-store NOI. We don't include lease terms. We don't include bad debt expense in those numbers. We don't include straight-line rents.
Michael Bilerman: And was there anything in the true-ups that you were talking that those are in the numbers or out of the numbers?
Bill Schafer: Those true-ups would have been adjusted to make truly a comp comparison.
Michael Bilerman: So you adjusted both years?
Bill Schafer: Right. Actually, we really just adjusted the first year because I think the numbers would have been spread throughout the various quarters last year, so we really didn't make any adjustment for the prior year number. We did in the current year, we adjusted for the 2007 or the adjustment that we made in 2008, we eliminated the effect of that.
Michael Bilerman: Okay and then just on the sales that you're doing, both the core and non-core assets and also the merchant build. We've seen a lot of REITs provide seller financing to get deals done. Is that any bit realm of what your doing?
Scott Wolstein: There's a real possibility we may do that on an interim basis in order to accomplish a transaction on a timely basis, but our goal if we did that would be to refinance that debt as soon as possible.
Michael Bilerman: Is this all the transactions and what sort of magnitude of seller financing are you talking about and how do you get comfortable with providing that?
Scott Wolstein: How do we get comfortable with providing it?
Michael Bilerman: Yeah, just in terms of what terms, how long, what rate?
Scott Wolstein: We're really governed very specifically by our auditors in that regard. Whatever financing we provide has to be regarded as market rate, both in terms of proceeds and in terms of interest rate. We're not providing the financing with a way to enable us to achieve a higher purchase price, if you will. It's really much more of a timing issue. Where those are today? Just to give you some guidance, I mean, they're in line with recently announced financings by our peers, pretty much 70% loan to cost is where the market is on the proceed side and interest rates roughly 250 to 300 over LIBOR.
Michael Bilerman: And how long are you comfortable providing seller financing for? Is it a short-term? We've seen guys go 30 day to a 90 day max. We've also seen in some cases a transaction where it was two years at 0%. So I'm just trying to understand where your threshold is.
Scott Wolstein: I would really rather not get into those specific details until we announce the transaction. I wouldn't expect that we would have a loan outstanding that we didn't refinance either behind the loan or in place of the loan, within 90 days.
Dan Hurwitz: And also, I think it's important relative to other transactions, this is not subsidized financing. This is market rate financing where we're not sacrificing anything regarding the economics relative to the market.
Michael Bilerman: But the reality is these deals couldn't get done today if you didn't provide the financing?
Dan Hurwitz: I wouldn't necessarily say that. I would say they wouldn't get done as quickly. The financing is available in the market. It just takes a long time.
Michael Bilerman: Right. These assets have mortgage debt on them or they're unencumbered assets?
Dan Hurwitz: Some do and some don't. The ones that do, that would remain in place.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed, sir. Mr. Sullivan, your line is open. Your phone may be muted.
Nick Vedder: This is Nick Vedder here with Jim. Sorry about that. Just looking at your supplemental, it looks like the estimated leasing commission/tenant improvement has been ticking up recently. I'm just curious if this is a general trend that we should expect to see going forward as an effort to maintain occupancy?
Bill Schafer: Well, I don't think the tenant improvements are a general trend. That spikes quarterly, depending on the nature of the transaction and where it fits in the portfolio, as you know. If we have a significant number of re-leasing in the lifestyle portfolio, that number will go up. If it's in the community center portfolio, it will go down. I think that's more time sensitive than anything else. It's really not capital that you're providing the tenant, it's actual cost. We are going to see an increase in third-party leasing commissions paid as tighter economics forced tenants to move more with off balance sheet real estate departments. So, instead of having their own internal real estate group, we're seeing a much more third-party broker-oriented representation by retailers which is adding cost to the overall transaction.
Nick Vedder: Okay. So, you're not really seeing too much pushback in terms of lease concessions, incentives at this point?
Bill Schafer: It's all focused on price right now. We're not seeing a lot of concessions. We're not seeing a lot (inaudible) for a lot more additional capital. They're really looking for lower rent for the most part, if they can get it and we've seen some of that in the portfolio and it's reflected in some of our numbers. In terms of the capital expenditure numbers, I think overall our numbers are so low relative to a lot of others that even just smaller increases end up being a larger percentage increase on our overall tenant improvement and capital expenditure budget, so it is going up somewhat but in terms of absolute dollars, it's on the side of this portfolio, it's not that significant, it's just relative to a small base of spending.
Dan Hurwitz: But we absolutely are seeing and I think we will continue to see as a trend increased cost to lease from a third-party perspective. Even those tenants that have had brokers historically represent them; the cost of those brokers has gone up dramatically.
Nick Vedder: Great. Thanks. Quickly, a second question. Looking at the MDT refinancing, you mentioned that it was refinanced about $340 million at a 60% to 65% loan-to-value. What sort of cap rate could you equate with that?
Scott Wolstein: The lender equate to that?
Nick Vedder: Yes, yeah, what was the cap rate that they were expecting on that transaction?
Scott Wolstein: I think the lenders are typically applying a cap rate in the low-to-mid seven on their financings which is probably less than the value of the assets, but that's what they're typically applying from an underwriting standard today.
Nick Vedder: Okay. Great. Thanks.
David Oakes: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. Thank you for joining today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."
4,SITC,3,2008,2008-10-27 17:00:00,"Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to the Third Quarter 2008 Developers Diversified Realty Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today’s call Ms. Michelle Dawson, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Michelle Dawson: On today's call, you'll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, Bill Schafer and David Oakes. Before we begin, I'd like to alert you that certain of our statements today may be forward looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our press release dated October 23, 2008. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.DDR.com. Lastly, I’d like to request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time I'll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott Wolstein: I am pleased to announce this quarter’s financial results of $0.83 per share which compares to last years third quarter results of $0.80 per share. Before I begin I would like to reiterate the statements I expressed in the press release that we issued earlier this week. My own experiences over the past several weeks have illuminated the risks associated with leverage in capital constrained environment. In my day to day activities as Chairman and CEO I am committed to fostering a more conservative approach across all business lines and throughout or national and international pursuits. The absolute top priority on my agenda and that of each of us on this call is to ensure that we are positioned to comfortably navigate this challenging environment and emerge from it even stronger. We will take proactive steps to reduce our leverage utilizing any and all necessary financial measures to protect our long term financial strength. Throughout today’s call you will hear how we are adjusting our strategy and proactively adapting to the current environment. That being said, as we review our third quarter results we continue to see the stability of our product type becoming increasingly evident which contributed to the consistency of our core operations. For example retail sales results reflect consumers continued shift to value oriented retailers and as a result our centers and our largest tenants have been and should continue to be the relative winners in the retail marketplace. We can see this trend reflected in our leasing volumes which set an all time company record in terms of the number of new leases executed in a quarter and in our leasing spreads which are comparable to historic averages of roughly 10% growth on an overall blended basis. Moreover the same store long term leases and renewal options that dampen our internal growth in bull markets now serve as important down size protection in a bear market. As evidenced by our recent press release we continue to close on asset sales and are actively addressing upcoming debt maturities. In response to unprecedented events that have taken place in the capital markets we have adapted our strategies and continue to do so in order to mitigate risk and focus on our core operating results. While you will hear much detail on those results later in the call I would like to focus on the big picture. Our priority continues to be enhancing liquidity, protecting the quality of our balance sheet and maximizing our access to a broad set of capital sources. Potential new investment opportunities will be pursued but only with significant equity and debt financing in place and only where carefully underwritten expected returns sufficiently exceed our current cost of capital. I want to reiterate our focus on selling assets to third parties and into joint ventures. If we look across our maturities in 2009, 2010 and beyond and taking severe disproportionate approach as many of you have done in recent weeks we know that these asset sales represent one of the least expensive sources of capital available. Probably only surpassed by our internally generated retained cash flow. We had flows and are continuing to progress on numerous individual or small portfolio asset sales that should generate over $200 million for 2008. In addition, as we announced this morning we have signed a letter of intent for the sale of approximately $900 million of assets into an 80/20 joint venture with an institutional partner that we know that will generate several hundred million of net proceeds. I will let David Oakes give you details later as well as the progress update on a number of smaller asset sales. Second, we continue to work very hard to conserve capital and to make all capital allocation decisions more prudently than ever. To that end we continue to scrutinize any and all capital expenditures on our development pipeline. We will mitigate risk by phasing projects and carrying land which we already own until leased and financed. We will not pursue any projects that do not meet our pre-leasing thresholds or whatever percentage is necessary to secure third party construction financing or our return thresholds which stand in excess of 10% return on costs. Fortunately our asset class does not require a significant amount of regular leasing or maintenance capital expenditures. We could operate our portfolio in a highly cash efficient manner and still generate consistent cash flows. Our free cash flow after all expenses and interest and including CapEx and preferred dividends exceed $300 million per year. Before we discuss capital markets I will briefly review our third quarter results. With respect to international development we have suspended all spending in Russia until we have greater clarity on the economic and business environment in that country and until debt financing is available on commercially reasonable terms. In Brazil we are finishing our project in Manaus which is almost fully leased and expected to come online at April. We are not commencing any new development projects at this time. We continue to believe in these development projects in Brazil and their returns but we are carefully rationing capital for the near term. With respect to our operating portfolio in Brazil we continue to generate extraordinary NOI growth we are pursuing capital recycling opportunities and are in discussions with several large institutional investors regarding joint venture investments. We have seen many very difficult cycles before and we know that the best strategy is to focus and commit to the basic blocking and tackling of running a high quality retail real estate portfolio which generates the vast majority of our revenue, drives value creation and generates more capital available for distribution. At this point I will turn the call over to Bill Shafer for his comments on the quarter.
Bill Shafer: Before we discuss capital markets I will briefly review our third quarter results. Our FFO for the quarter continues to reflect consistent results driven by our core portfolio performance. We earned FFO of $0.83 per share which compares to $0.80 per share in the prior year, an increase of 3.75%. Although our operating margin dropped somewhat reflecting higher vacancy and bad debt levels same store operating results were positive for this quarter. In light of all the volatility in the economy and the financial markets I was pleased with our portfolio results which reflected a $0.03 increase over the prior year results. I would also like to discuss a few specific items that were included in our numbers but had no net impact on the overall results. First, during the quarter we recognized $16 million tax benefit similar to the valuation reserve that was released in the first quarter 2007 the majority of this amount related to the release of additional valuation reserves associated with deferred tax assets that were established over prior years that were acquired from JDN. These valuation reserves were established due to the uncertainty the deferred tax assets would be utilizable. Based upon the increase in fee and miscellaneous other non-real estate related income opportunities and the recent transfer of various management contracts from the re into the TRS which will result in future taxable income. It was necessary to eliminate the reserve based on the current facts and circumstances which now indicate that a reserve is no longer necessary. Second, we recognized approximately $3.5 million of mark to market hedging losses which were generated by our additional equity ownership in MDT Joint Venture. These mark to market losses offset the mark to market income of over $3 million of those recognized in last quarter. There was no cash impact to our operations however as a result of these accounting related adjustment there was also approximately $1 million of transactional related charges incurred relating to our joint venture in Brazil. Both of these charges reduced our equity and net income from joint ventures. Third, we recognized $5.8 million accounting loss on the sale of our 55% consolidated joint venture interest in an office building in Massachusetts that was formerly occupied by Cisco. Our partner triggered the buy sell provisions and we determined that selling our interest in the building was much more economically and strategically attractive then buying their interest despite the negative FFO implications for the quarter. Finally, as is common in our business we are involved in certain litigation matters. In one case the jury came back with a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Although we disagree with the jury’s decision and are appealing the verdict we have increased our reserves relating to this matter. This accrual significantly contributed to the increase in our other expense line item of $6.6 million over last years third quarter amount. We do not believe there are any other potential material legal rulings that will impact our operations. Again, the net impact of these four items on our quarterly results was essentially zero. Turning to capital markets, as we disclosed in our recent press releases our financing activities on behalf of DDR and our joint venture partners aggregated $525 million during the third quarter. Aggregate financings total $1.2 billion for the year, $1.1 billion of which represented new capital. Although the credit environment has become much more difficult in the last few weeks we continue to pursue opportunities with the largest US banks, select life insurance companies, certain local banks and some international lenders. Across the board approval process has slowed while pricing and loan to value ratios remained dependent upon the specific deal terms but in general spreads are higher and loan to values are lower. The financial crisis is not unique to DDR or the RE industry in general for that matter. Various governments throughout the world have announced numerous initiatives that are intended to strengthen and solidify the world’s financial systems and restore confidence in the global economy. This process however will take some time. Although the ultimate impact to the national and global economy is uncertain today we believe it should become much clearer over the next several months as opposed to years. Accordingly we have always focused on the company’s long term growth and the primary focus on the current environment and navigating through the upcoming year and through 2010 as well. Early in the year I provided you a capital plan for upcoming quarters. I would like to give you an update on that plan having put 2008 largely behind us. I will outline our cash needs followed by our funding strategy. Excluding loans for which we have options to extend we have approximately $400 million of consolidated debt maturing in 2009. We have approximately $350 million of joint venture debt maturing in 2009 of which our share is approximately $60 million. Of the aggregate $750 million to be refinanced in 2009 approximately $275 million of indebtedness is unsecured and less than $15 million of mortgage debt has recourse to DDR. Of the $400 million consolidated 2009 maturities we expect to repay approximately $50 million using a combination of equity raised from expected sales, retained capital, additional secured financings and our line of credit. These obligations are comprised primarily of mortgages originated several years ago and assumed in various acquisitions. The loans are small, well amortizing and thereby have low leverage of approximately 50% loan to value. We expect to refinance roughly $70 million of mortgage debt on two assets. These loans were originated in 1999 and are also well amortized and have an estimated loan to value ratio of approximately 44%. The most significant maturity relates to the $275 million of unsecured notes maturing at the end of January 2009. Although this maturity has been address to retain capital line of credit availability, additional sources of capital potentially include proceeds from sales initiatives mentioned earlier in which David will discuss in more detail, proceeds from new secured financing along with other initiatives currently underway. As Scott mentioned our strategy includes looking ahead not just to 2009 but to the following years as well. Over the years we have been very careful to balance the amount and timing of our debt maturities. Notably we have no major maturities between February 2009 and April 2010 providing us with adequate time to ensure that the larger maturities including our credit facilities, which occur in 2010 through 2012, are addressed well in advance. The weighted average interest rate on the consolidated debt expires without extension options in 2010, is approximately 5% using current LIBOR rates. This includes $500 million of unsecured senior notes and $428 million of secured debt. The estimated loan to value ratio on the consolidated secured debt maturing in 2010 is approximately 40%. Even in dislocated markets this low loan to value should allow a very high likelihood that refinancing even at increased proceed levels will be achievable. Potential sources however clearly also include capital recycling and retained capital which has consistently been a cornerstone of our financing strategy. With respect to capital expenditures we consider this type of spending to be completely discretionary. Within our development and re-development portfolios we have dramatically reduced expected spending and as Scott described are able to do so by phasing construction until sufficient pre-leasing is reached and financing is in place. Funding for these expenditures will be provided by capital recycling and asset sale activities including potential joint venture and sale of certain developments. Operating cash flow and existing perspective construction loans a market we continue to tap for new financing. Moreover we have significant unencumbered asset pool of approximately $5.5 billion which continues to be available for potential financing, and we have the ability to replace over $500 million of unsecured debt with secured debt and still satisfy our covenants. Furthermore one of the great benefits of our asset class is the relatively low level of capital necessary to lease and maintain the portfolio. We expect we will need approximately $26 million or $0.38 per square foot during 2009 for leasing and maintenance CapEx including our proportionate share of joint ventures which is line with actual amounts expended in previous years. As David will discuss in more detail we will continue to increase our flexibility as the result of pending joint ventures, third party asset sales and financing activities that are already under way. We will be extremely diligent to improve our balance sheet and this objective is at the top of each of our priority lists today. These are difficult times but once this period of macro volatility is behind us we will emerge a stronger company as a result of our ability to act quickly and opportunistically as we have done in other challenging cycles. Moreover, we have the support of our large lenders and equity partners to get us through this period of market uncertainty. I’ll turn the call over to Dan now.
Dan Hurwitz: Considering the enormous disruption occurring in the capital markets and the internal operating disruption that can result we are pleased with the portfolios performance this quarter and the focus of our employees. As Scott mentioned leasing activity this quarter established a new record for aggregate new square feet leased. We signed new leases with Kohl’s, Publix, Buy Buy Baby, Fresh Market, Bells Outlet and HH Gregg. Not only did we produce 1.84 million square feet of lease space but the highest production region was our Southern region which produced 182 leases and 940,000 square feet. Given our exposure to Georgia and Florida it is important to note the outstanding deal velocity in that market compared to the negative headlines at each market, particularly Florida continues to generate today. These results reflect certain changes in our leasing strategy some of which have been in place for several months already. Our top priority is to maintain occupancy. We’re staying in front of tenants by conducting full portfolio reviews and traveling to their headquarters in record numbers. We’re renewing tenants early and currently have 67% of our 2009 renewals either complete or in documentation. We continue to accelerate the time it takes for leases to be processed by our attorneys and revisiting deals that had previously been declined. Simply put, it takes more hustle and creativity to close deals and our leasing team continues to deliver. Moreover it is important to note that our capital contribution to these leasing transactions is minimal by nature of the community center business compared to other property types. We typically re-lease space on an as is basis with minimal costs associated with new leases and essentially no capital expenditures on lease renewals. We also see clear trends across the broad retail industry and in an environment such as this there is a flight to value. Consumers become increasingly price sensitive, becoming discretionary spending in favor of necessities, groceries and discounted apparel and general merchandise. Retailers that can offer this price leadership and value proposition are outperforming those that cannot. We see that manifest itself every month in sales and margin results. The market share shift to tenants that offer value and convenience is accelerating dramatically. Moreover while retail bankruptcies and store closing are frequently in the news today the reality is that most of our tenants are very healthy with larger more diversified operations and much stronger balance sheets than in the past. Credit quality matters now more than ever. With respect to those handful of tenants that have recently announced bankruptcies I’d like to bring you up to speed with recent announcements. With respect to Mervyn’s we have eight locations aggregating 600,000 square feet and $3.7 million in pro-rata annual rental revenues which were on the initial closing list. Mervyn’s however has not rejected any leases and as a requirement of the bankruptcy law is required to remain current in their rental payments. Mervyn’s announced last week that it intends to liquidate. They have not yet announced the definitive auction date for all its real estate and as a member of the creditors committee we are monitoring the proceedings very closely. We are currently receiving positive tenant interest for many of these boxes and are prepared to respond quickly to opportunities to release or sell if we were able to recapture some stores after the auction process. In the event that a competing retailer, adjacent property owner or another interested party acquires a Mervyn’s lease that buyer of the lease would assume all terms and obligations of that lease and we would not incur any costs or experience any interruption in rental payments. As discussed in the press release we issued earlier in the week our original underwriting on this investment was based on the value of the underlying real estate reflecting the possibility that Mervyn’s would default or declare bankruptcy. We were the first buyer to acquire locations from Mervyn’s and as such focused our interest on those assets we believe represented the best long term real estate value. In addition, the acquisition was intentionally structured to protect our interest by providing a $25 million purchase price adjustment secured by a letter of credit provided by the seller. In addition, we have an $8 million letter of credit provided by Mervyn’s as security deposits on specific leases. All of our Mervyn’s locations currently contribute less than $10 million per year or approximately $0.08 per share after the debt service secured by these assets. Based on the current level of tenant interest in these locations and the funds available to us to cover the cost of re-tenanting the space we do not expect our results to be materially impacted as a result of the Mervyn’s bankruptcy. It is worthwhile to note that these Mervyn’s are the exclusive collateral for $259 million of mortgage financing which is non-recourse to DDR and MDT and matures in October, 2010. We own the Mervyn’s assets in a 50% consolidated joint venture with Macquarie DDR Trust in which we both invested roughly $75 million of equity in 2005 and we have received approximately $25 million in net cash flow after debt service since we acquired the portfolio three years ago. Linens ‘n Things has announced that they are liquidating. The real estate will be sold at auction which we expect to be held in early 2009. We currently expect to have 10 closed locations that represent 325,000 square feet and $2.3 million in pro-rata revenues. We have another 28 leases, which, depending on the outcome of that auction could be assigned or rejected. These leases aggregate 940,000 square feet and $4.7 million in pro-rata rents. In anticipation of a worst case scenario we been actively marketing our Linen boxes under the assumption that we receive all of them back and to date we have received positive feedback on many from potential tenants. Steve and Barry’s which filed in July has been purchased and will emerge from bankruptcy. Of our 10 locations three leases were assumed and assigned. The two locations that were rejected and the other five locations that are holding going out of business sales aggregate 380,000 square feet and $1.9 million of pro-rata annual revenue or approximately $5.00 in annualized base revenue per square foot. Similarly Goody’s which filed in June emerged from bankruptcy earlier this week with new equity and debt capital in place. We had 16 leases rejected and expect to receive one more in early 2009. These rejections represent 550,000 square feet and $1.8 million in pro-rata revenues. Our remaining 21 leases will continue to operate without interruption. As a result of the new bankruptcy laws we are seeing important differences in the manner in which retailers proceed through the bankruptcy process compared to previous years. Retailers must now be much more prepared prior to filing bankruptcy because the window of time they are allowed to come up with a plan of reorganization or liquidation has been shortened dramatically. While it used to be common practice to lengthen the delay decisions on leases we are seeing tenants make decisions much quicker thereby giving us better visibility then we have had in the past. We have also significantly adjusted our leasing strategy to meet our challenging environment. In response to recent tenant bankruptcies and likely space recapture we have created a dedicated division within our leasing department to focus on marketing and re-tenanting of those boxes. As part of this initiative we have a Vice President of Leasing and staff members actively monitoring and involved in the day to day events of the bankruptcy. This process increases our ability to pursue package deals or portfolio transactions. We are dedicating considerable resources and putting significant focus on the re-tenanting process to ensure that it is smooth and is profitable as possible. We are already evaluating a number of potential transactions with retailers who are obviously viewing this opportunity as their means to enter new markets and win market share. Tenants that are actively making new deals that could potentially backfill these boxes include Bed Bath and Beyond and their Christmas Tree Shops and Buy Buy Baby concepts, TJMaxx, Marshall’s, AJ Wright, Kohl’s, JC Penney, Ross Dress for Less, Joanne’s, Dicks, Sports Authority, PetSmart, Petco, HH Gregg, Staples, Fresh Market, Best Buy and several others. We expect more bankruptcies to occur and our positioning ourselves appropriately. That being said we do expect a short term hit to our portfolio leased rate because of down time regarding the re-leasing efforts of the bankrupt tenants previously discussed. Occupancy should trough mid way through 2009 and then start to regain ground during the second half of the year. Turning to development, we have significantly reduced our anticipated spending for the remainder of 2008 and through 2009. One of the important benefits of our asset class is that we have the ability to phase development projects over time until comfortable leasing levels can be achieved. To further ensure judicious capital spending earlier this year we put new more stringent investment criteria in place. The new underwriting criteria include a higher cash on cost project return threshold, a longer lease up period and a higher stabilized occupancy rate. It is also important to note that among our development joint ventures we, as the development director have the control over capital expenditures. With respect to our international developments we will host the grand opening for our project in Manaus, Brazil where over 90% of the space has been leased in April 2009. Funding for this development has been provided by a combination of retained capital from the operating portfolio in Brazil and our Real based revolver. In light of the volatility of the Russian markets and the current unavailability of local debt however we will suspend development there until we see a debt market emerge that can finance our investments more efficiently. Our joint venture currently owns two sites there aggregating 69 acres. Operationally this past quarter was very rewarding considering the environment in which we operate. We have every expectation that 2009 will be equally as challenging. We are responding in a conservative manner by concentrating on our core operations and limiting development spending. More importantly this realistic approach has been carefully reflected in our 2009 budget. On that note I’d like to turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: There have been two major themes you’ve been hearing about throughout the call. First that we have been and continue to evaluate all sources of funds to ensure that we are liquid and well capitalized in the near term and the long term and prepared for threats and opportunities that may arise. We have sold assets in the past and we will continue to do so with these transactions represent one of our least expensive forms of capital and can have a very positive impact on our portfolio operations and performance. Second, we continue to be very prudent and selective in evaluating all expenditures on a risk adjusted basis. We are viewing investments through a very different prism then used in the past. While this is an opportunistic time for many investments our focus is only on pursuing those in a fashion that does not cause any stress to our balance sheet. I would like to give you a brief update on how we have implemented those strategies, an idea of what we expect to occur over the next few months. As described in last weeks press release we closed on $73 million of asset sales during the third quarter bringing the total to over $100 million of asset sales year to date. Pricing on these asset sales reflect reasonable comp rates given the current environment with an average cap rate below 6% for the third quarter. Pricing on these asset sales reflected some vacancy but generally reflected cap rates of roughly 7% for smaller assets in non-core locations on a fully leased basis. The sale of our Massachusetts office building is a good case study on how asset dispositions may incur short term costs but are economically appropriate under a long term scenario. We had acquired this asset as part of our acquisition of American Industrial Properties and held our 55% interest in a consolidated joint venture with an insurance company. The in place cap rate on the sale was 3.4% and reflected the properties 70% occupancy rate. This asset sale made sense in terms of our overall business strategy and generated $20 million of liquidity in addition to the amount of capital that would have been required to re-tenant the currently vacant space. These aspects of the sale significantly outweighed the near term cost of the $0.05 loss that included in FFO due to this sale. Other dispositions completed during the third quarter include the sale of Brownfield Jersey City asset which was fully occupied by two tenants with long term relatively flat leases; a private individual with local financing purchased this asset at a cap rate in the upper sixes. Also during the quarter we sold four single tenant assets leased to PetSmart and Joanne’s at cap rates in the low to mid 7%. Although these sales may reflect negotiations that began in a strong economic climate transactions continue to move forward and investors continue to have an interest in quality real estate with predictable cash flows at fair pricing. As evidence of this continued activity last week we put $23 million of assets under contract. This week we put another $35 million of assets under contract and signed LOIs on an additional $27 million of asset sales. Plus, as Scott mentioned we find a term sheet with an institutional investor that we have worked with before on approximately $900 million of asset sales at a cap rate near 8%. The transaction is expected to generate over $270 million of net proceeds to DDR, more than $170 million of which will be available immediately upon closing which is expected in mid December. These proceeds in turn will be used to de-leverage our balance sheet. We will provide further details on this transaction once the sale is closed. We are also having advanced discussions with other large institutional capital sources regarding potential joint ventures. In addition, we are in the process of offering a portfolio of stores to the largest and best capitalized retailers in our portfolio. The potential sale of these relatively flat cash flow streams could generate in excess of $200 million of net cash proceeds. Currently we have a total of $71 million of asset sales under contract with a weighted average cap rate around 8% and another $92 million subject to LOI with weighted average cap rate in the low 8%. Perspective buyers range from local individuals to larger more regional private investors to large Re’s. We continue to receive bids on assets we have listed and will push forward to close those sales. We are working to tee up additional sales for 2009 closings including a mix of quality assets likely to be placed in joint ventures as well as non-core assets and single tenant assets with flat but highly predictable cash flows. We feel it’s a good opportunity to monetize our investments in these assets and reduce leverage or recycle the capital in the new investments. Similar to Dan’s comments with respect our leasing team our transaction team is working harder, faster, and more creatively to find buyers and close deals. We are also moving forward on the formation of an institutional venture to invest in distressed development projects and other high value add opportunities. We are currently in advanced stages of documentation with select lead institutional investors with a collective objective of executing a first closing before year end. Give the pipeline a very attractive opportunity that we are tracking today. Thereafter we expect that subsequent closing with additional institutional investors during the first half of 2009. We would use this venture to selectively acquire projects that have become available as a result of the considerable market dislocation. This is an opportunistic time for many investments but we continue to be very prudent in choosing investments with the highest risk adjusted returns. We see a significant number of projects with some level of distress and increasingly projects offer considerably below another investors cost basis in an effort to avoid personal bankruptcy. We are underwriting those using a very conservative assumptions which quickly eliminate the vast majority of those projects. That being said there are some very compelling opportunities that are becoming available at highly favorable terms and pricing. At this point I’d like to turn the call back to Scott for his concluding remarks.
Scott Wolstein: In our remarks today you’ve heard how we are making proactive adjustments to our operations and long term strategies and how our balance sheet strength is our top priority. We intend to generate capital from expected asset sales including sales to JV’s, retain capital and existing and perspective financing to fund our debt maturities and to the extent we deem appropriate any further capital expenditures. With respect to the remainder of 2008 the primary uncertainties are the timing, volume and pricing of merchant built sales. Due to the significant volatility in the market we may not hit our previously announced targets. Obviously current pricing for larger, high quality assets is not fully reflecting those positive attributes so we may well choose not to sell all of our potential merchant built assets this year. Our goal is to generate proceeds that can be profitably reinvested not just to look at booking near term merchant building gains to achieve earnings targets. The risks associated with the recognition of these gains in fact have largely clouded our story which as you’ve heard this morning is quite simple and consistent. To improve the transparency of our business and to encourage investors to focus on our recurring, reliable, operating revenue we have made two important changes. First, at the rest of several analysts we added disclosure to our quarterly supplement which lists all developments and re-developments that comprise assets that could be sold to generate merchant build gain recognition. Second, with respect to the remainder of this year and beyond based upon extensive feedback from numerous investors and analysts we will be providing guidance based only on operating FFO exclusive of gains, losses and other items relating to the sale of assets. We believe this change in guidance and reporting will prove the transparency of our business, highlight the visibility and consistency of our earnings and return the focus of our business to where the vast majority of our cash flows are earned. That being said, excluding these gains and losses we expect 2008 FFO to be in a range of $3.22 to $3.28 per share. Even at the low end of this guidance at the current share price we traded 2.6 times FFO. This multiple reflects more than a 60% discount to our peers and to the industry. While this guidance is a more appropriate reflection of our core operations we still do believe that there may be significant transactional income that would be added to this number that may be recognized before the end of the year. With respect to 2009 guidance, however, given the extreme uncertainty in the markets there are too many significant variables that are too fluid for us to provide the same levels of formal guidance that we have traditionally provided on our third quarter conference call. That being said, our best estimation at this time based upon our outlook regarding leasing, development and financing activity is that 2009 FFO should be approximately $3.00 per share. This expectation includes net de-leveraging of more than $500,000, increases in interest rates and also includes a non-cash impact of the change in accounting treatment for the convertible securities which amount to approximately $0.12 per share. As referenced above this figure excludes any gains and losses from asset sales. Based upon these expectations management has recommended and the Board of Directors has approved a 2009 dividend policy that will maximize our free cash flow while still adhering to payout requirements. This policy amounts to an annual 2009 dividend per share of approximately $1.50 to be paid quarterly. To further enhance our liquidity and to apply this updated mindset regarding payout policy we will omit our fourth quarter 2008 dividend. This will generate more than $80 million of additional capital to further increase our liquidity. As a result our 2008 common share dividends will aggregate $2.07 per share. In total the change to our 2008 and 2009 dividend policy should result in additional free cash flow of at least $230 million which will be applied primarily to reduce leverage. In summary, we have a great company and an outstanding portfolio. We are hopeful that the dramatic improvement in our balance sheet and the significant change in our policy as to earnings guidance will eliminate distractions and enable investors to focus on the exceptional company we are and the quality of our operating cash flow. At this point I will return the line to the operator and receive your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Christine McElroy - Banc of America.
Christine McElroy: Can you provide some more color on what types of assets were included in the sale announced today? Would you say they’re a good representation of your overall portfolio or are these more non-core assets?
Dan Hurwitz: The 13 assets as a whole represent a pretty broad spectrum of our assets by geography and even product type. I would say they are reasonably representative of the portfolio as a whole. It’s not the best but wouldn’t consider them non-core, they’re good shopping centers.
Scott Wolstein: The best way to look at that is if we put assets in the JV those assets that we want to continue to be invested in and in this particular joint venture we have a promote structure that enables us to benefit from value creation in those assets over time. When we’re dealing with non-core assets we typically don’t keep them in joint ventures because we consider our joint venture partners just like our shareholders and we don’t want to put any assets that we wouldn’t want to own ourselves. You can always assume that when we announce a joint venture those are closer to core than non-core.
Christine McElroy: You mentioned that assets sales are your least expensive option for raising capital today. Can you walk through how you think about the cost of raising other types of equity capital as you look to de-lever next year?
Dan Hurwitz: I think we specifically said the retained cash flow now with the revised dividend policy that we generate is the lowest cost of capital and the most certain capital in this environment, asset sales then behind that based on where other alternatives are today. As we look at an extremely depressed stock price that implies a cap rate that is well above where we continue to execute on asset sales it seems clear that generating equity from asset sales is the more attractive option.
Christine McElroy: Where you are getting the $500 million is basically the asset sales and the dividend cuts?
Dan Hurwitz: That is accurate.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa – Merrill Lynch.
Steve Sakwa: When you’re talking to these institutions about these JVs I guess how are their return expectations change, what are they looking for, what kind of hurdles do they want to hit in these kinds of arrangements?
David Oakes: It depends on the institution whether they’re a leveraged investor or an un-leveraged investor. Typically the leveraged investors that are willing to tolerate a little more risk are looking for a current cash flow of roughly 12% leveraged. Something north of that in IRR over a long term hold.
Dan Hurwitz: As part of managing the gap in expectations today we are finding a number of investors with an interest in down side protection or minimizing the risk there and I think our assets in the long term cash flows serve that very well versus some of the investors a few years ago looking for the extreme up side. For us especially in a joint venture with promoted structure we still believe we can capture that up side and our assets naturally deliver the stability that many of the investors that are still in the market are looking for today.
Steve Sakwa: I just want to make sure I understand when you were talking about this whole de-leveraging process, put into perspective how much exact capital would you like to raise or how much debt are you looking to effectively pay down over the course of the next 15 months?
Scott Wolstein: That $500 million target that David mentioned it’s a good ball park of what we would like to achieve in 2009 as far as de-leveraging. I think what is equally important is that we have a clear visibility on addressing all our debt maturities far in advance. So it isn’t purely a matter of de-leveraging but it’s also a matter of terming out a lot of our debt and finding other sources of capital that are more reliable long term. Basically terming out our debt maturities.
Steve Sakwa: Between the dividend cut and the large joint venture that you just raised that effectively is the $500 million.
Scott Wolstein: I was talking about $500 million before the dividend cut. In terms of transactions.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank.
Lou Taylor: Can you talk a little bit about the rationale in the dividend cut in terms of maybe other options you thought about maybe just to dividend suspensions for a couple of quarters or maybe taking some of the money and actually buying your stock a little bit as well. Can you just go through the thought process there?
Scott Wolstein: The dividend cut is a source of capital whether we use some of that capital to repurchase our securities whether they are debt or equity is a completely different decision. I wouldn’t rule that out. We just felt that based on where these shares were trading and where the investors seem to be concerned about our company’s balance sheet and liquidity it was really inappropriate to maintain the dividends at such a high level and we thought that the capital could be better deployed in doing some of the things you’re suggesting. We have debt securities outstanding trading is huge discounts and we have abilities to take this retained capital and go out and buy back that debt and eliminate any risk going forward and on a very highly accretive basis. The interesting aspect of a de-leveraging strategy today isn’t just to de-lever but it’s also to de-lever and take advantage of investment opportunities that give us historic yields on our investment and at the same time give us an opportunity to increase the quality of the balance sheet. I think we would be remiss if we didn’t take advantage of that opportunity.
Lou Taylor: In terms of the large JV you announced this morning. What’s the status of that is it just at the LOI stage or you at a signed contract stage. Where is it in the process?
David Oakes: We have actually a letter of intent that agrees on all the economic turns and the partner has been engaged in due diligence for a few months now. We expect to be under contract shortly and we expect the transaction to close in mid December.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Sticking with the joint venture here for a second, can you just with comp structure you have $890 million total assets, how much debt is going along side that, how much seller financing would you be providing to the venture and then understand the proceeds that you’re taking out and timing, the $260 million and then total but only $170 million up front.
David Oakes: Basically the transaction is structured with overall leverage of about 70% well into the value addressed in the transaction. Approximately 50% loan to value is in the form of third party financing and approximately 20% is in seller financed mezzanine paper. The reason there’s a difference between the immediate proceeds and the ultimate proceeds on the transaction to us is because half of the assets are already have financing in place and the other half of the assets are unencumbered and we’re in negotiation with lenders on a loan secured by those assets and we’ve basically structured the transaction with the terms we anticipate that loan to provide.
Michael Bilerman: So there’s about $220 million of existing debt that’s going with it you’re going to go out and get another $220 million.
David Oakes: More than that but at this point our historic policy has been that we haven’t announced the transaction until we were further along. At this point we thought a signed LOI on a deal of this size in a market like this was a material event to provide some details on but would not look to provide complete details on this transaction until we’re closer to closing.
Michael Bilerman: How do you think about the $180 million of seller financing and what sort of terms is that being provided, what sort of rate is that being provided?
Scott Wolstein: We’re not going to get into those details on this call. I’m not sure we ever will get into that level of detail because we’re in negotiations with other institutions on similar joint ventures and we don’t want them to use the terms of this joint venture against us in other negotiations.
Michael Bilerman: If you’re providing capital to a joint venture I would assume that’s going to be an important piece of your capital raising strategy but also it will impact how your numbers are going to be.
Scott Wolstein: Yes but the capital that we announced is net of that. That’s all net new capital. Net of any seller financing that we’re providing.
Michael Bilerman: It’s 70% levered with your seller financing that only leaves $260 million total why is there a difference and that’s for total you only have 80% of that. I’m just trying to understand.
Scott Wolstein: We have 100% of the proceeds from the joint venture. We’re selling the assets to the joint venture. We continue to own 20% on a go forward basis. I don’t understand your point.
Michael Bilerman: Can you talk a little bit more have you thought about it from a metric standpoint in terms of de-leveraging where you say okay today I’m at this leverage ratio and this fixed charge I want to get to ‘x’ and ‘y’ by the end of next year and ‘a’ and ‘b’ by the year after.
David Oakes: Yes, we look at it both from a covenant standpoint as well as from the standpoint of where we would calculate our leverage today based on our metrics. The top priorities as we look at this strategy are one, in a market where the investor feedback we’ve gotten is an extreme concern about the liquidity situation of every real estate company to at minimum make sure that we have addressed our maturities over the next several years with a clear plan and with as much of that plan as possible being events that are completely under our control as opposed to dependent on a third party. Along with that strategy to lower our leverage by any metrics whether it’s ours or the banks by several 100 basis points. Say lowering a leverage metric by two to five percentage points.
Michael Bilerman: What are your stock holdings today and any other margin that you may have, where does it stand?
Scott Wolstein: I have 500,000 and change in remaining shares in the company. They are placed as collateral to a line of credit that’s not a traditional margin law.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Vedder - Green Street Advisors.
Nick Vedder: In your prepared remarks you mentioned that you have roughly $500 million of secured debt that you could place on encumbered assets. Is that as of 3Q or is that including some of these potential asset sales?
Dan Hurwitz: That is as of September 30th. Sales reflected in the third quarter what we closed would be reflected in those metrics what is post-September closing is not.
Nick Vedder: In terms of your total and your debt covenant and your line of credit with respect to your total debt over your total assets you’re boxed in at 60%. Where do you stand as of 3Q?
David Oakes: Actually we have the ability to go to 65% too for a few quarters there. We are under the 60% threshold as of September 30.
Nick Vedder: How much room do you have to increase debt under that covenant, are you close to the 60% or you have some more wiggle room in there?
David Oakes: The transaction we announced today and with the dividend policy we’ve announced we’re having significant push under there. Several hundred million dollars.
Nick Vedder: With respect to the asset sale that you have under contract can you provide some comment in terms of the characteristics of those properties and are they core, non-core, are they unencumbered properties or is there assumable debt. Just trying to get a feel for what those properties are like?
Scott Wolstein: Are you talking about the assets sales versus the JV?
Nick Vedder: Yes.
Scott Wolstein: It’s a broad array of properties that are all considered non-core. There’s one large package of single tenants, CVS Drugstores, for instance pretty flat leases. There are properties that have fairly low occupancy where buyers are paying for the pro-forma income where we don’t share the buyer’s optimism as to the future of those assets. None of those assets would be considered assets that we would want to maintain in the core portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: You mentioned occupancy troughing sometime mid next year. Can you give us a sense of where you anticipate occupancy going over this time and you mentioned more bankruptcies, any more specifics there?
Dan Hurwitz: As far as occupancy is concerned for our 2009 budget we see it across the board dropping between 150 and perhaps 200 basis points from where we are today. Over the course of the third and fourth quarters we see ourselves battling our way back up to maybe a little better than we actually are today. A lot of that is really going to depend on what happens with the final disposition of these bankrupt tenants because we are assuming that we have all the Linens ‘n Things back in vacant. We’re assuming we have all the Mervyn’s stores back in vacant and it is unlikely that some of those stores will not be purchased in auction. Exactly how many is pretty hard to predict based on the bids that have been received to date and the negotiations that are ongoing. But 150 to 200 basis points seems to be where we’re headed. By the end of next year we should be back a little above where we are today.
Jay Habermann: You mentioned in the release as well there’s been pretty strong interest for the Mervyn’s spaces. Can you give us a sense of perhaps how much of that space there’s been interest already indicated for on the part of retailers?
Dan Hurwitz: Right now probably a little less than half of the Mervyn’s spaces have I would consider very, very strong interest where actual economics discussions have commenced. The other half it may take a different type of occupant. We may have to split the boxes, for example, as opposed to someone taking the entire box. We know that there are currently transactions being discussed amongst the debtor and tenants directly. We’re going to have to see. We’re very comfortable that the downside on approximately half of the Mervyn’s boxes should be able to minimize that. As far as your second question which was future bankruptcies, it’s a very difficult question to answer. There are tenants quite frankly that are operating out there today not in bankruptcy that many people thought would already be in bankruptcy. Certainly it’s no secret that we have a large exposure to Circuit City and Circuit City has had its share of issues. There are others out there as well. It remains to be seen what happens with the vendor community because what’s happening with these retailers as we’ve gotten very involved with the Goody’s process, the Linens’ process the Mervyn’s process is that it’s the vendor community that’s putting these tenants out of business it’s not the landlords and it’s actually not even the banks it’s the vendor community. If the vendor gives up on the retailer then it sort of lights out for that retailer. The tenants that continue to receive vendor support will be able to limp their way through and the tenants that don’t won’t make it. It’s going to be very interesting to see. Right now it seems like the vendor community is not incentivised to put anyone out of business. That’s what we’re seeing because if you go into some stores that are really undercapitalized today they still have a lot of inventory and a lot of merchandise. Vendor support is still there for some. The ones that have disappeared though and particularly in the Linens ‘n Things situation if you shop their stores you could tell that the vendor community had quit on that retailer very early in the process.
Scott Wolstein: One other thing that I think all of you should keep in mind as you look into the Christmas season and so forth. A lot of people try to equate the health of retailers to their sales volumes and this is going to be a year where retailers are going to be looking for margin and not looking for high volume. Retailers are not going to go out on a limb this year and buy a lot of inventory, put on the shelves and hoping that the customer shows up. Even though you may see some drops in same store sales over the holiday season that doesn’t necessarily mean that retailers are not achieving their plans and in many cases it may actually enhance their profitability and the quality of their credit. It’s going to be an interesting season. Often time’s people watch CNBC and they just look at the sales number. On tenant in our portfolio for instance that’s a good example of that is Old Navy. We’ve seen their sales drop dramatically across the portfolio but they’re doing better on their margins then they were doing before at higher volume.
Jay Habermann: You talked about de-leveraging and obviously given the weakness in the stock price of late it certainly puts more emphasis on probably selling more assets here in the near term. Given that 2010 seems to be the number that everyone’s focusing on these days can you respond to that in terms of again the $5.5 billion of unencumbered assets? You’re talking about selling some boxes back to some big retailers.
Scott Wolstein: Yes, we are in discussions with Wal-Mart, Target, Lowe’s and others to sell them back flat leases in the portfolio that improves our growth rate. It also enables us to access capital at a fairly good price.
Jay Habermann: Is that sub 8%?
Scott Wolstein: I would expect they would come in at sub 8%. You basically have to look at what their cost of capital is for the various retailers. Obviously Wal-Mart has the lowest cost of capital of that group. That can generate upwards of $200 million in proceeds to the company. It’s a highly efficient transaction and we can deploy that very accretively to investments. We will be aggressively applying these proceeds to repay some of those maturities in advance. We will be in the market trying to buy those bonds at a discount. As I said before it’s truly an historical opportunity. We have converts out there trading right now at yield to maturity north of 20%. The ability to sell a box to Wal-Mart at anything south of an eight cap and take that money and put it to work at a 20% yield to maturity is a pretty remarkable opportunity which we are going to aggressively pursue.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carol Campbell - Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Campbell: Have you all taken care of refinancing any of your 2009 maturities at this point?
Scott Wolstein: I think we addressed that in the script. The only major maturity is at the end of January. That will be refinanced from retained capital and our credit line availability.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller – JP Morgan.
Michael Mueller: I think you may have touched on this at various points, you talked about assets you would want to hold and then you talked about assets you wouldn’t want to hold. Can you about where you see the cap rates for where institutions would pay for the stuff that you would want to hold, core stuff versus the non-core which looks like its trading at around 8%?
Scott Wolstein: Eight cap is kind of a ballpark. There will be deals that get done a little south of that, a little north of that but that’s the ballpark.
Michael Mueller: That’s the ballpark pretty much for everything.
Scott Wolstein: For the institutional quality stuff today. The irony is that non-institutional quality stuff, the non-core stuff it actually trades at cap rates typically lower on income in place because the buyers are buying pro-forma income. From a standpoint of taking income off of our income statement and putting it to work in new capital a lot of those transactions are actually getting done a ridiculously low cap rates. For instance the office building in Boston that we’re selling is like a 3.4% cap rate because there’s a fair amount of vacancy. We’re only taking a small amount of income off of the income statement and generating a lot of capital that we can put to work immediately at much higher returns.
Michael Mueller: I think you were talking about assets under contract, assets under letter of intent. Outside of the joint venture that you close in December can you just quantify what do you think will hit in the balance of ’08 in terms of asset sales? Really just a magnitude of, like a ballpark range for what you think could be the asset sale number in 2009?
David Oakes: The assets we mentioned either under contracts or subject to letter of intent we would expect the great majority of that to close during 2008 so looking at the next really six weeks for the closing there that’s where due diligence has been done in many cases and in other cases its just extremely simple assets based upon they’re single tenant, highly stable, cash flow. At this point the outlook for 2009 asset sales includes the transactions with large well capitalized retailers that Scott mentioned where they could be repurchasing some boxes where they currently have long term flat leases with us. It also includes roughly $100 million of additional non-core sales. We’ve been, as Scott mentioned, continuing to find buyers for these assets somewhat because the individual assets are smaller, somewhat because you’ve got individuals that simply have a more bullish outlook on an individual local property than we might. The target on that number and the expectation for non-core sales is $100 million for 2009 and then the other less tangible initiatives we mentioned in terms of discussions regarding other joint ventures are not included in those figures but could easily amount to several hundred million dollars.
Michael Mueller: The retailer related transactions that was a couple hundred million dollars.
David Oakes: It could be as much as $200 million is what we outlined based on the packages that are out there. A safe range would probably be $100 to $200 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities.
Jeff Donnelly: Are you able to bracket for us the prospects for realized gains and losses on asset sales across the organization in 2008 and 2009 maybe like a sensitivity different cap rates?
Scott Wolstein: Maybe you didn’t hear the statement about not providing guidance on gains from asset sales. We’re not going to do that. As we do our formal guidance later in the quarter we’ll probably have to look at that more closely because it may affect the dividends during the year.
Jeff Donnelly: The reason I was asking is that I’m wondering do you think there’s a greater chance if you recognize losses instead of gains on these. I just curious what your basis is in your assets.
Scott Wolstein: I don’t believe that’s going to happen.
Jeff Donnelly: Concerning your 2009 guidance what are you anticipating for things such as bad debt, expense recapture efficiency and maybe even rent concessions through existing tenants. We’re facing a difficult holiday season on top of this already tough environment. I think people want to know you’ve baked in a fair degree of conservatism to arrive at your $3.00 guidance.
David Oakes: With regard to bad it’s relatively consistent. I think for a big chunk of the expense that we’ve been recognizing this year probably is taken into account the tenants that are the lesser quality. We’ve already recorded I would say significant bad debt expense this year. When you look at the credit quality of our asset base on a moving forward basis we expect really bad debt per se to be a little bit lower. They have indicated there’s going to be some actual occupancy, our occupancy right now is a little bit lower and that will be increasing throughout the year.
Dan Hurwitz: In regard to rent concessions we’ve had a surprisingly low amount of rent concessions in the actual core portfolio which is one of the reasons why it’s holding up so well and performing well. Interestingly though we have had a number of tenants try to re-trade us on development projects that have not yet commenced. As a result, since that spending as we’ve talked about completely discretionary if the tenants want to re-trade a deal that reduces the return below the level that we’ve prior approved we just won’t build the project. What that’s going to do it’s going to make it very difficult for the tenants to hit their open to buy for the given year. It actually will give us more pricing power going forward. We are under no pressure to build projects unless they hit our threshold returns and most of the re-trading that we’re seeing is on those projects where tenants feel that they have the leverage in the current environment. Of course the response to that leverage is not to build the project.
Jeff Donnelly: Where are those development thresholds going in this environment?
Scott Wolstein: For us they’re going up because we’re requiring them to go up or we’re not building the projects. Overall for some of the projects that are in the process they have cracked down. We have projects in the low 9% that are coming out of the ground, some in the high 8%.
David Oakes: The exciting opportunity in the development business is going to be in taking on projects that are already in tough shape with private developers who are capital constrained and unable to deliver in working with banks to capture those projects and use the banks capital to get them finished. I expect returns on those projects to be frankly well north of our 10% threshold. One of the reasons that catch rate of some other companies who are dismantling their development operations we’re keeping ours in tact because we think our competency is going to be a very rare resource that banks are going to really want to tap into in the coming year or two because they’re going to be forced by regulators to take back a lot of projects that are in process that have already been titled, already leased but just can’t get financed. They’re going to turn to people like us to work it out for them and to get those projects finished. We’re pretty excited about that opportunity and that’s why we’ve created this value fund with institutional capital to take advantage of that.
Dan Hurwitz: I think another important part of it is sometimes we just talk about these headline return numbers but I assure you there’s also been extreme focus from the senior most members of our development department up to the senior members of management to make sure that the underwriting of these developments is extremely cautious and extremely realistic reflecting the current market environment whether that’s a timing issue on lease ups, whether its more clearly quantifying risk in an environment that clearly has more risk. It’s not only the headline number going up its that we are much more carefully underwriting this and believe we’ve got an exceptional development team that can do that even in an environment with this many challenges and an exceptional leasing team that can do that in terms of their relationship and knowledge of what retailers will actually pay to be on a sight.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Harris – Royal Capital.
David Harris: Does this feel worse than the early 90’s in an operational sense the capital markets?
Scott Wolstein: I would say that was pretty bad but yes I think this is worse.
David Harris: It’s worse now or you expect it to get worse?
Scott Wolstein: No, I think it’s worse now. I think that it was difficult to get a loan in 1991 on a real estate project. One of the problems with that question is we’re a very different company today then we were then. We have access to the very few loans that are out there where we may not have back before we became a public company and had the size and scale that we have today. Back in the early 90’s there were certain aspects of the capital markets that were closed. It wasn’t all of them. The dislocation in the corporate bond market today is really unbelievable, and much worse then that was back then I believe. There was a lack of liquidity back then because there was really occasion by the tax reform act of ’86 and the S&L crisis and taking that liquidity for the syndication market out of the real estate industry. This particular liquidity crisis goes well beyond the real estate industry and it goes throughout the entire economy. That really wasn’t the issue back in the early 90’s.
David Harris: Can you comment as comparisons between now and back in the early 90’s on the operational side, the property side? I think most of us have a fair handle as to how terrible it is on the capital markets.
Scott Wolstein: Operationally maybe Dan could speak to that even better than I can. Other than these few tenant bankruptcies operations side right now is pretty good. We’re not feeling a lot of distress out there. We just went through our portfolio reviews, went through virtually all of our properties with our leasing agents and I was frankly amazed at the level of activity that’s out there and the level of interest from retailers and boxes. The problem with the retail business is that it’s highly competitive and there are times where retailers take market share from each other and people come and go. We’re just in one of those places because of the lack of capital in the system where we’ve got some of the weaker retailers are disappearing and being replaced by others. When I look at that operationally it’s really more an issue of down time until you put a stronger retailer in the box I really don’t think we’re looking at a severe dislocation in the retail market particularly at the value retail level where you’re dealing with everyday necessities.
Dan Hurwitz: The biggest difference operationally from the tenant community is that today our tenants are better capitalized, they’re stronger, they have more market share and they have most importantly in this environment much better control over their inventory. Tenants are able to gauge their inventory needs to a point of profitability much better today then they did in the early 90’s which is where we had significant fall out. That being said there are far fewer tenants today then there were in the 90’s. It’s nice that our tenant community is healthy because we need them. In the early 90’s you in some cases had three, four and even five players in every category but today because of consolidation we’re really down to two. The options on re-leasing space and operating in this environment the tenant roster is shorter, much shorter than it was in the early 90’s but at the same time the tenants are healthier.
David Harris: On the operational guidance that you’ve given I’m right in thinking that would exclude any transactional income that might have been generated through the joint ventures?
Bill Shafer: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Spector – UBS.
Jeff Spector: I just want to make sure the new guidance is this a permanent change?
Scott Wolstein: Yes.
Jeff Spector: A quick question on the credit markets, obviously they’re still frozen. We’re hearing that a lot of banks have stopped lending even in the past week because companies continue to draw down their lines of credit. Can you just talk about some of the conversations you had this week, even just in the past couple days?
Scott Wolstein: I’m going to let Francine Glandt answer that because she talks to these banks almost every minute.
Francine Glandt: We are talking to banks daily and actually we’re in the market right now with some financings and have received quotes. Last week we received a few and we’ve got some this week as well. There are still key relationships that are lending to us. I will say the loan to values are lower. What would be quoted as a 60% loan to value in our eyes is probably a low 50% to mid 50% when you factor in the calculations and cap rates and various reserves that the lenders use. The hold levels are lower; a bank typically would have held $50 to $60 million in some cases they’re now asking for $25 to $30 million. The pricing of course as Bill mentioned is a bit higher. They do take longer to close but they are doable. I would say one benefit that we have is that we can take financings and break them up into smaller portfolios. We can put properties individually into loans of $30 or $35 million as opposed to having to put together a consortium of banks for $200 million. That is an advantage in this market where smaller does tend to finance better.
Bill Schafer: There’s one other think that I’d like to mention which hasn’t been talked about much by anybody. Necessity is the mother of invention and there are a number of people out raising funds right now to go out and fill the void that’s left behind by the banks in providing debt. I had dinner last night with somebody that runs one of those funds who’s just raised $3 billion in institutional capital and there are several of these out in the marketplace. While it may be pretty tough right now for a lot of people there is going to be lenders out there that are non-traditional that are going to start to fill that void. They may even provide capital to people like us to go out and buy some of our debt in the marketplace. There is some good news on the horizon too it’s not all bleak.
Jeff Spector: Can you mention what cap rate the banks are talking about over the last week in their quotes?
Francine Glandt: The typical cap rate that I’m seeing these days is in the 7% to 7.5%. Of course it depends on the deal that you’re shopping but that’s what I’ve seen.
Jeff Spector: On the leasing front can you talk a little bit more about the progress you’ve made in ’09 I believe you said you’re about 67% is that in contract stage?
Dan Hurwitz: That is correct. That’s either executed or in contract. That’s on renewals. As we look at our ’09 budget we’ve made the conscious decision to advance discussions with tenants on renewals because we want to have obviously clear visibility on what those tenants intend to do. Historically we have not done that that is a change in policy for us because we like the idea of tenants missing their renewals because we get to mark that lease to market which is usually substantially higher than the actual renewal price. We’ve been actively out there, we have a staff of specialists that just handle renewals because there was something that we are extremely focused on and we’re very comfortable with where we are. At the time of the weekly volume of transactions as you can see from our numbers is so high, much higher than we thought it would be the 67% number is probably by the end of this week by today will be closer to 70% for ’09.
Jeff Spector: Can you let us know what type of spread you’re seeing?
Dan Hurwitz: It’s very consistent with what we’ve seen with the past. A spread when we do a new lease is down a little. We had some quarters in the mid to high 20% and on new leases we’re seeing in the mid to high teens for the most part. On renewals we’re seeing in the 8% to 10% range and the blend is really in that sort of 10% to 12% range. One of the things that could skew that number though that we’re very sensitive to is what happens with the vacant boxes. There will be boxes no question that we do deals with tenants at a lower rent than Linen ‘n Things was paying or Mervyn’s was paying. That could have a negative impact on that number. Absent those extreme situations we’re trading a little lower in the new leases and we’re trading within our norms on the renewals.
Jeff Spector: I don’t know if you can answer this but clearly one of the pressures the vendors are, one of the pressure points is from the factors do you have any color on what’s happening on that side of the equation?
Dan Hurwitz: It’s not pretty. There’s no question about it. The factors are scrutinizing the retailers in a way that they’ve never done before. Terms for retailers are continuing to shrink for the most part. That is adding to some of the stress that is on members of the retail community. Some of the vendors are making up for that. There are certain vendors out there that fear the day when there’s only one retailer that is actually a distribution channel for them. They are keeping other retailers afloat themselves where they’re actually almost factoring themselves. The pressure currently in the vendor community and the factor community is as extreme as you would imagine in a market like this.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Can you expand on the litigation and the legal verdict in the $6 million of costs and what that sort of related to and what the status is?
Scott Wolstein: We had a tenant in one of our shopping centers who claimed a loss of business by an improper operation of a valet parking service, sued us for loss of business over a period of years won a jury verdict that we are appealing.
Michael Bilerman: The $6 million is the reserve that you’ve taken for that?
Scott Wolstein: No, the $6 million is not the full reserve and we have been advised by council not to—It’s not the full amount of the judgment its.
Dan Hurwitz: The judgment was $10.8 million the reserve was $6 million.
Scott Wolstein: That does not indicate the full reserve we had for that particular item.
Bill Schafer: By the way we also have the opportunity to pursue a cross claim against the city because the reason the valet service wasn’t what the tenant had hoped for was because the city didn’t allow us to provide it. It’s a very complicated situation but that’s about what we’re looking at in terms of the numbers.
Dan Hurwitz: Just to further clarify on that matter. The increase in the other expense line item was about $6.6 million. It includes probably a normal recurring abandoned project stuff but it also includes the litigation related costs in addition to potential reserves associated with ultimate settlement.
Michael Bilerman: The list of assets that are eligible for merchant build is very helpful to have so I appreciate you putting that in. I’m not trying to ask for more but what would be helpful is just to have the un-depreciated book value of those assets so that we can understand what the totality from a development cost is of those assets to be able to understand what could occur.
David Oakes: We should be able to provide that, it’s available in our public filings and we can certainly include that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: The senior debt based on the credit facilities can you just remind us if you have the ability to extend the unsecured credit as well as the secured?
Scott Wolstein: Yes, we do have the ability to extend each of those for one year term.
Jay Habermann: Have you already begun that process?
Scott Wolstein: They don’t mature until several years out.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt - Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt: I’m just wondering given the real estate business as a lagging indicator at what point to you think your operating metrics will be the worse during the 2009 is it going to be right after holiday or later in the year?
Dan Hurwitz: It’s usually right after holiday. What happens is we’ll know and retailers will know right after holiday, when I say right after holiday, holiday today includes January. We’re really talking about February. The retailer’s cash position is the best obviously in the first quarter and we’ll know at that point in time if they have the resources necessary to get to the fourth quarter to reenergize and replenish that cash supply. If you look at the cash position of most retailers, June/July is the low because they’re placing orders for the holiday and their sales are always the lowest. If they don’t get enough cash reserves generated out of the first and second quarter we’ll know that and we’ll start to see some fall out. If we get through midway point of the year and we’ve seen that this year as well. Most retailers survive through the holiday because there’s really no benefit for them to close before they have the opportunity to benefit from holiday sales.
Craig Schmidt: Is there a potential for negative same store sales during ’09 in any of the quarters?
Dan Hurwitz: Yes, I think there is real potential for negative NOI for same store sales depending on what happens with these bankruptcies and I think you’ll start to see that in first and second quarter if it’s going to happen.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Anar Ismelo] – GEM Realty.
[Anar Ismelo]: You mentioned non-recourse on your mortgages. What is your ability to really walk away from those properties not that you have to but if you were without triggering anything under the credit facility?
Dan Hurwitz: We have the contractual right under the terms of the mortgage to deliver the properties not anything that we’ve done or take lightly in any way nor is it our expectation that it is something that we will do. You pay a certain price for non-recourse financing for that level of flexibility in those situations but I reiterate again that is not anything that we have plans or historically have done.
[Anar Ismelo]: I was trying to understand if the credit facility limits the amount of walking away you can do from the assets?
Dan Hurwitz: We would expect that if that were the case which again we do not at all expect that there would be a negotiation to be had with the unsecured creditors where at that point they would have to view what’s in their best interests and we would deal with that if we came to it. Again, we don’t expect to get there.
[Anar Ismelo]: Do you still have an option to expand your credit facility to $1.4 billion?
Scott Wolstein: Yes.
[Anar Ismelo]: Are there any conditions satisfied before you expand it?
David Oakes: The conditions are, there’s not any obligation for any existing lender to increase their commitment levels. It’s just a matter of going out and finding the additional commitments to take it up to that level.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities.
Jeff Donnelly: I was curious maybe more big picture about how we should be thinking about the evolution of big box tenant leasing demand obviously we’ve seen announcements and actions taken around closings this year I think conventional wisdom is we should see more of that closing going into 2009. How long do you think it takes before we move from what I’ll call a net closing market to maybe a net absorbing market? Is it late ’09 that we begin to see retailers look to find leases for openings in 2010 or does it come sooner than that.
Dan Hurwitz: It really depends on the retailer you’re talking about. Most of the retailers that we’re dealing with forgetting the ones that are in bankruptcy aren’t net closing at all. In fact they’re net opening. There are certain stores out there that we have a sense that are net closing but they’re the vast minority. In fact what people sometimes don’t realize but you do pick up when you talk to the retailers directly is that even though they’re new store count is down its more down because of the absence of supply as opposed to the absence of demand. Most of our tenants are adjusting their new store openings to the lack of development activity and the lack of product and going back into the inner core. I think in general it will take us probably 18 to 24 months to absorb the boxes that are going to hit the market or have already hit the market due to bankruptcy. Overall if you look at the big box retailers the health and the growth profiles are quite strong and the demand for space obviously still exists as you can see from the leasing results.
Jeff Donnelly: Related to that are there regions around the country where you’re seeing a disproportionate impact on those closings you mentioned. Conversely are retailers the ones you mentioned to the extent they do have limited opportunities to open stores are there regions that they’re avoiding, is it Florida markets such as that?
Dan Hurwitz: We’ve said many times that retailers really are a very local business. While Florida certainly has a bad name as does of course Phoenix or Vegas there are opportunities to do leasing in those markets and that’s why even we were surprised by the volume of deals that we did in Florida over the last quarter. I think in general though if you talk to most retailers they do have their hot markets that they are looking to go in to. Most would say that given an opportunity that makes sense from their global perspective they would do it in any market. We’re seeing New England for example is extremely hot right now as is Washington D.C. which has been hot for about 10 years now from a retail perspective. If we were going to take a look at a market though that has the bulk of the closings in our portfolio its going to be the Southern California market and the Phoenix area where you’re going to have a whole slew of Mervyn’s and you’re going to have a whole slew of Linens ‘n Things.
Scott Wolstein: In terms of the portfolio reviews that we recently completed, the only region that had negative growth budgeted for 2009 was the Southeast. We had pretty good numbers in the other regions frankly in our portfolio.
Dan Hurwitz: That actually includes Puerto Rico which as many people have read recently has come under some pressure economically as well no different then we are here yet our same store sales continue to grow in Puerto Rico and our NOI continues to grow there as well.
Operator: Your last question comes from [Quentin Valeli]– Citigroup.
[Quentin Valeli]: I know you’ve had $140 million of asset sales under negotiation in the MDT joint venture I’m just wondering if you can give us an update on those sales?
Dan Hurwitz: Yes, we continue to work on sales not only for our own consolidated balance sheet as well as for our important partners. That includes MDT we’ve made considerable progress on one transaction that we expect to have more news on in the very near term and continue to advance on assets listed and make progress on other asset sales on the behalf of Macquarie DDR Trust.
Operator: At this time we thank you for participating in today’s conference you all may disconnect and enjoy the rest of your day."
5,SITC,4,2008,2009-02-24 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 Developers Diversified Realty Corporation fourth quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call, Ms. Kate Deck, Investor Relations.
Kate Deck: On today's call, you'll hear from Scott Wolstein, Dan Hurwitz, Bill Schafer, and David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued today and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and on our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our press release dated February 23, 2009. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. I would like to call your attention to an important press release that we released moments ago. The transactions described by this press release will be discussed on the call this afternoon. Lastly, I’d like to request that callers observe a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time I'll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein
Scott A. Wolstein: Good afternoon everybody. First let me talk about our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter of 2008 we reported FFO before gains on debt repurchases on impairment charges of $0.74 per share versus last year’s fourth quarter FFO results of $0.77 per share. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008, our FFO before gains, impairments, and other charges was $3.29 per share which compares to $3.09 per share for 2007. Including impairment charges of over $215.0 million our FFO was ($0.95) per share for the quarter and $1.52 positive for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2008. We are very pleased today to announce two significant capital transactions that will occur in 2009. First, we have entered into an agreement for the strategic investment of Alexander Otto and members of the Otto family into our common stock as described in the press release released moments ago. The Otto family is well respected in the international real estate, retail, and finance communities and their investment provides a huge opportunity to synergize our retail real estate expertise with theirs. Their purchase of 30.0 million common shares comes at an extremely important time for our company to be able to use this capital from the transaction to reduce indebtedness. The sale of these shares will occur in one or two tranches at the option of the Otto family. If it occurs in two tranches we anticipate obtaining the initial proceeds from the first closing of 15.0 million shares in April, and the proceeds from the second closing of an additional 15.0 million shares will be obtained no later than October. The first tranche will be purchased at $3.50 per share and the second tranche will be purchased at the price of $4.00 per share, premiums of 33% and 52% respectively to Friday’s close. In addition, we will issue warrants to the Otto family for the purchase of up to 10.0 million additional shares at $6.00 per share, which represents a 128% premium to Friday’s close. Those warrants will be granted in two tranches of 5.0 million each upon the two closings I mentioned before. Secondly, the Otto family is funding a five-year $60.0 million first mortgage loan to the company which we can use to extend our overall debt duration and repurchase unsecured notes to a discount at par. Alexander Otto and other members of his family are the owners of ECE Projektmanagement of Germany, Europe’s leading firm in developing and managing inner-city shopping centers with over 100 shopping centers in their portfolio. In addition, Alexander Otto is the largest shareholder of the German-listed company Deutsche EuroShop AG which owns 16 shopping centers in Central Europe. The Otto family owns a large number of businesses with particular focus on real estate, retail, and finance and controls numerous retailers with hundreds of stores throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. The Otto family has been active in the North American real estate and retail industries for decades. With their ownership of the Paramount Group, Alexander Otto and his family control one of the largest privately owned real estate, acquisition, redevelopment and management firms on the East Coast. The portfolio of the Paramount Group includes several high-rise buildings in New York and Washington, DC. Also in the metropolitan area of Toronto, the Otto Family owns numerous apartment buildings and industrial parks. In regard to North American retail, the Otto Family currently owns Crate and Barrel. We at DDR are very excited about this transaction and will be filing an 8-K with complete details shortly. The transaction is subject to shareholder approval so will also be filing a proxy. Upon completion of this transaction, we also look forward to adding two new Board members being nominated by the Otto family, which we expect to add further expertise in alignment of interest with our shareholders. Given the dramatic changes in the capital markets over the past year that has affected most companies, I would like to take a moment to reiterate how we have adapted our business strategies to date and how we plan to navigate through these difficult times going forward to ensure that we emerge a stronger company. We have implemented significant changes to our business model that will result in us operating with increased liquidity and lower leverage. The steps we are taking to improve our position hold top priority for our senior management team and we are taking immediate and aggressive action to address those issues as demonstrated by the transaction that I just discussed. We are firmly committed to enhancing our liquidity. We have already made progress in strengthening our balance sheet and reducing leverage in recent quarters through several initiatives which I will touch up on now and you will hear about in greater detail throughout today’s call. In December we sold $43.0 million of common equity. Proceeds were used to pay revolving credit facilities and buy unsecured notes at a discount to par. Although we recognize the high cost of equity capital today and the new issuance of shares is dilutive to certain metrics, this demonstrates our commitment to enhancing our firm’s financial flexibility. We purchased $70.0 million of unsecured notes at a discount to par. The notes were purchased for approximately $58.0 million, including $48.0 million of the January 30, 2009, maturity, resulting in a weighted average of about 81% to par. During the first quarter we sold $58.0 million of unencumbered, non-core assets at a weighted average cap rate of 7.8%. For 2008 as a whole, we sold $200.0 million worth of assets aggregating roughly $140.0 million of net proceeds to DDR after repayment of debt before closing costs. The weighted average cap rate on these sales was approximately 6.9%. In January 2009 we also sold a $22.0 million center at a 12.8% cap rate, an $8.0 million center at an 8.1% cap rate, and five former Mervyn’s locations to Cole’s. The latter two transactions were from joint ventures. We also omitted our fourth quarter 2008’s common dividend payment that would have been made in January 2009, which results in cash savings in excess of $80.0 million. This additional retained capital was used to repay indebtedness. We will set the 2009 annual dividend at approximately the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT status. A year ago we were paying roughly $330.0 million of annualized common dividends per year on the net outstanding shares. The reduction of the dividend to the taxable minimum will save our company approximately $200.0 million per year. Additionally, our Board of Directors has approved that our first quarter 2009 dividend will be paid 90% in stock. If we pay all of our 2009 dividends in stock this will give us the ability to retain in excess of $100.0 million of additional capital in 2009. The dividend savings provide significant funds to address pending cash needs and debt maturities. On January 20, 2009, we repaid the outstanding balance of our maturing unsecured notes using asset-sale proceeds, free cash flow, and capacity on our revolving debt facility. As of today, we have addressed all of our consolidated debt maturities through February, including all of our unsecured debt maturities for the full year of 2009. And we are working with lenders to extend or refinance maturities on secured indebtedness for the remainder of the year. We are finding great success in extending three CMBS loans that mature in the first quarter of 2009 beyond their contractual charge and have been in constant contact with our lenders and loan services about our upcoming obligations. With the repayment of the January 30 unsecured notes, we have no other major debt maturities until May of 2010. We continue to remain in compliance with all of our financial covenants and our bank facilities and our public indebtedness and we will continue to take steps to provide additional cushion on these covenants. We have many initiatives underway in 2009 that will continue to strengthen our balance sheet. In addition to the sale of common stock to the Otto family and the new $60.0 million mortgage loan, we will continue to purchase unsecured notes at a meaningful discount to par. The focus will be on near-term maturities at the most attractive pricing. We will sell additional assets with an expectation that more than $200.0 million in sales is achievable in 2009. We are currently well ahead of that pace and we hope to exceed it. We will raise capital through new secured mortgage debt with life insurance companies and our commercial banking relationships. We will also dramatically slow spending on our development pipeline. Notably, we do not expect to start any new projects in 2009. Most importantly, based upon our expected free cash flow of approximately $300.0 million per year, expected asset sale proceeds of $200.0 million, the proceeds from the Otto transaction of $175.0 million, and minor free financing assumptions including that only 60% of expiring mortgage debt can be replaced, we are pleased to say that we now have the capacity without any other activities to address all of debt maturities for at least the next two years. In addition, we have $5.7 billion of unencumbered assets and an ability to add approximately $700.0 million of net new secured debt to generate additional proceeds within the confines of our debt covenants. At this point I will turn the floor over to Bill Schafer.
William H. Schafer: First, I would like to give an update on operating results. Our reported FFO for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $1.52 per share. Excluding impairment and other non-recurring charges, operating FFO was $3.29 per share. This also excludes the gain on repurchase of debt. As reflected in our earnings release, the fourth quarter operating results include several unique, primarily non-cash net charges aggregating over $215.0 million, or $1.78 per share as follows: consolidated non-cash impairment charges aggregating $79.9 million; non-cash determination of an equity award plan for $15.8 million; abandoned projects, transaction costs, and other expenses of $20.8 million; non-cash impairment charges on equity investments aggregating $107.0 million; impairment charges and other expense recorded in equity income loss from joint ventures of $8.5 million; loss on discontinued operations of $3.0 million; and the effect of charges allocated to minority interests was an offset of $18.7 million. The consolidated impairment charges were primarily associated with several units previously occupied by Mervyn’s and a half dozen other assets that are not expected to recover in value and may be sold in the not-too-distant future. The valuation techniques that we used included discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization approach, appraisals, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations, and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties. The joint venture impairment charges defined as other than temporary as defined in FAS 157 and discussed in our earnings release primarily relate to the DDR TC Core Retail Fund, investment in MDT units, DDR SAU Retail Fund, and Coventry II DDR Bloomfield LLC. It is important to note that accounting rules require that different and shorter term standards be applied when measuring impairments in joint ventures. The valuation techniques included those just previously discussed and valuation of publicly traded equity securities based on quoted market prices. In addition with regard to certain joint venture investments, the fair market value of the joint ventures debt was also considered. As was previously announced, we terminated a supplemental equity award plan in December and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $15.8 million. We chose to terminate this program as it no longer provided any motivational or retention value to our employees. No employees have received any cash or stock payment from this plan. We are focused in retaining and motivating good employees but the creation of this plan was creating an annual financial expense to the company without any benefit to our team. So the decision was made to terminate it in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. The non-recurring charges and other expenses primarily include abandoned projects, litigation charges, and a loan loss reserve. As we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we will significantly limit our development spending to complete select projects underway where we have significant leasing in place. We have abandoned certain development projects and transactions that were in the very early stages and we will delay other projects until the economic environment improves. As a result we recorded charges aggregating $11.5 million. It is important to note that none of these non-cash charges affect our current liquidity. Moving on to the company’s operating performance, I am happy to report that same store operating results, as defined in our supplement, were positive this year at 1.7% for the year and 1.5% for the quarter. Also, ancillary income is up 14% year-over-year. We are pleased with the hard work of our leasing, property management, and new business development teams that is shown in these results. Also, our operating margin after adjusting for bad debt expense, as reflected in our earnings release, was just over 72% for the fourth quarter results in 2008 and 2007. Also of note is that our joint venture investment with Sonae Sierra in Brazil continued to produce solid operating results. However, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the reals resulted in a $1.3 million decrease to FFO and net income as compared to the third quarter of 2008. It has been a challenging few months in capital markets and I would like to take a moment to provide an update on a few items. As Scott previously stated, we remain in compliance with all corporate financial covenants and we anticipate that our ratios will stay compliant and improve in 2009. The current value of our unencumbered asset pool as defined in our credit agreements is approximately $5.7 billion. Revolver capacity as of December 31, 2008, was approximately $285.0 million. Although borrowings were relatively high after year end and remain high today, we have relatively little maturing debt in the next year and we will use this time, along with retained cash flow, proceeds from future asset sales, and the previously mentioned capital raise and other initiatives, to reduce the balances. As we announced on the third quarter earnings call, we expect the 2009 dividend to be near the REIT taxable minimum. The Board of Directors has approved paying up to 90% of the 2009 dividend in stock to further enhance liquidity and maximize free cash flow and we will announce a definitive decision on the payout composition in the next few weeks. I will now turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I would like to start by providing an update on what we’re seeing in the leasing environment as retailers continue to navigate through a unique and very difficult economic and retail climate. As noted in our earnings release, our leasing team delivered another exceptionally strong quarter, and year, of leasing activity, especially when considering the tremendous headwinds they faced throughout 2008. Specifically, there were 105 new leases signed during the quarter, representing over 500,000 square feet of GOA at an average spread of 10%. There were also 204 renewal deals executed during the quarter representing over 1.3 million square feet and average spread of 3%. On a blended basis there were 209 deals signed during the quarter, representing nearly 1.9 million square feet of GOA at an average spread of 4%. For both new and renewal deals in 2008, the team produced 1,700 deals, representing 10.0 million square feet of GOA and a cash basis rental spread of 8.5%. The 2008 total represents a 775,000 square foot, or 8% increase, over 2007’s results, which should be noted, was achieved on a smaller average portfolio size and in a more challenging economic environment. While we are mindful of the fact that some retail companies have struggled and will likely continue to struggle, the reality is that many retailers are using this unprecedented economic environment to reassess their business plans and capture market share from their weaker competitors. During 2008 and into 2009 we had numerous meetings with retailers who are dropping their store count out of necessity, not because of any flaws in their business platforms, or an active desire to scale back expansion plans. Quite simply, for many retailers, there are not enough development opportunities in today’s market to support their growth initiatives. You have heard me say this before but it’s worth reiterating. In many cases, if a retailer could open 50 new stores, they would happily do so. As much as the headlines may imply that reduced store openings are another sign of a weakening retail environment, in many cases the reduced store opening plans are more the result of real estate issues than fundamental weakness within the retailers’ operating platforms. And the issue is a lack of viable new supply compared to demand. Even in this environment, retailers look well beyond the current year, typically modeling payback over a three- to five -year period, which will work to our benefit as we continue to retenant our vacancies. Along the same lines, many in our industry equate the health of retailers to their headline sales number metrics such as same store sales. Like 2008, 2009 is going to be a year where retailers look to solidify their margins as opposed to chasing high sales volumes. It would be imprudent for retailers to aggressively stock their shelves with large quantities of inventory and hope that headwinds facing the consumer subside and spending patterns immediately return to the norm. So even you saw some drops in same store sales over the holiday season and will likely see similar figures as we get further into 2009, that doesn’t necessarily mean that retailers are not achieving their plans. In many cases, the opposite may be true and they may be using this opportunity to enhance their profitability and the quality of their credit. Turning to the headline vacancies that have hit our portfolio, I would like to provide an update on the progress we have made to date in backfilling the spaces of tenants with which we had a high level of exposure. To start, it should be noted that during the third quarter we internally formed the anchor store redevelopment department with the anticipation that we would be getting an unprecedented large amount of junior anchor and big-box space back due to the struggles of many big-name high-profile retailers. Our anchor store redevelopment team has made considerable progress toward retenanting the major vacancies within our portfolio. It should be noted that we are just now getting control of many of these boxes, even though the bankruptcy or liquidation headlines of these tenants are nearly six months old. Of the 38 Goody’s locations in our portfolio, 16 were rejected in the late third and fourth quarter of 2008 with the balance expected back in the first quarter of 2009. The Goody’s portfolio is generating interest from those retailers looking to expand their footprint in the South, such as Bed, Bath & Beyond, with its various concepts, Alta Cosmetics, HH Gregg, Hobby Lobby, Big Lots, Bells, and Bells Outlet. To date we have actively revitalized on four of the former Goody’s boxes totaling 125,000 square feet, one location subject to lease negotiation, and one location with an executed lease. We own a 50% interest in 37 former Mervyn’s locations and a 100% interest in one former Mervyn’s location, which account for approximately 2.9 million square feet within our portfolio. Due to the quality of the real estate of the former Mervyn’s locations, tenant interest in these spaces are strong, with tenants such as the TJX Companies with its various conceptions, Ross Dress For Less, Forever 21, Nordstrom Rack, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Staples, Hobby Lobby, 24 Hour Fitness, and LA Fitness, all expressing various levels of interest. Considering we did not receive control of most of the former Mervyn’s locations until the first of the year, we are pleased with the high level of interest that has been expressed. Also, as noted in our press release from February 9, we sold five former Mervyn’s locations to Cole’s, the proceeds of which we used to pay down debt. And since have executed one new lease with Forever 21. To date we have 26 active LOIs on 15 of the former Mervyn’s spaces totaling 1.2 million square feet and an additional location at lease. Of the 50 Circuit City locations in our portfolio, seven have been rejected and Circuit City still controls the leases for the remaining 43 locations pursuant to their bankruptcy proceedings. Our Circuit City portfolio accounts for 1.6 million square feet of GOA of which 26 are owned in joint ventures. We have already received strong interest from retailers such as Bed, Bath & Beyond and its various concepts, the TJX Companies and its various concepts, Best Buy, HH Gregg, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Hobby Lobby, Big Lots, and JoAnne. To date we have active LOIs on 16 of the former Circuit Citys totaling approximately 570,000 square feet and have three space totaling 73,000 square feet at least. All told, within our anchor store redevelopment group portfolio we have approximately 2.9 million square feet of letter of intent in active negotiations, 285,000 square feet in lease negotiations, and 465,000 square feet of executed leases or sales, which accounts for approximately 38% of our total big-box vacancy. At this point I would like to address co-tenancy provisions and rent relief requests. Co-tenancy is very rarely an issue as a result of these retailers’ bankruptcies but does result in violation on an infrequent basis. Shopping center co-tenancy is typically tied to either a large anchor store, such as Walmart or Target or a series of junior anchors. For example, a co-tenancy clause may indicate that two of the following four anchors must be open and operating otherwise the tenant is permitted to go into co-tenancy or alternative rent. If we cure the co-tenancy the tenant must revert back to minimum rent. If co-tenancy is not cured, typically within the first year, the tenant has the right to terminate the lease and close their store or revert back to minimum rent. In most cases, the tenant will chose to revert back to minimum rent as the cost of closing a store and opening in a new location is much greater than staying in the current location. In some instances, however, the tenant will use the leverage generated by their right to close as a tool to renegotiate rental terms. That becomes a judgment call decided on a case-by-case basis. Regarding the number of rent relief requests received to date, 405 requests have come from various retailers across our portfolio. Portfolio-wide that represents approximately 1 in 30 of our tenants who have requested such relief. Of the 405 requests, 207, or 51.1%, have come from local tenants while 198, or 48.9%, have come from tenants with a regional or national presence. Regarding regional exposure within the portfolio, 42% of the reductions have come from the Southern region, 20% from the Western regions, 16% from the Northern region, 13% from our specialty centers group, and 9% from Puerto Rico. To date only 19 concessions have been granted for a term of one year. 81 requests have been denied and the remaining 305 are being reviewed internally. It is important to note, however, that our joint venture partners have significant influence on our decisions to either grant or deny rent relief requests. Nearly half, or 48% of tenants seeking rent relief operate at our joint venture properties. While actual concessions have been minimal, we view each request with an eye toward improving the terms of the deal from the landlord’s perspective. For example, there are instances where we would gladly provide concessions in exchange for the elimination of options, exclusives, restrictions, or co-tenancy clauses that may impact a particular property. Overall, most of the requests are being received by tenants with healthy balance sheets that are attempting to exploit the current environment. We are investigating each with great detail and are consistently less inclined to grant the request that one might think based on the retail headlines that we all read to date. Turning to a moment to our Brazil operations, our partnership with Sonae Sierra Brazil continues to produce exceptional results. There were several highlights during the quarter that I would like to briefly touch on to give you a flavor of the operating environment as well as the capital markets where conditions have remained relatively robust. A few key metrics reflecting the relative strength of Brazil’s economy and retail environment were recently released, which include the following: Brazil’s economy grew 5.6% in 2008 and is expected to expand 2% in 2009; fourth quarter retail sales growth was 6.3% in 2008; Brazil Central Bank lowered interest rates by 100 basis points and is expected to reduce rates further in 2009. Our particular operating portfolio continues to perform at a very high level as evidenced by the strong retail sales figures reported out of our centers as well as the occupancy and rental growth trends we are seeing and have seen on a consistent basis since our initial investment. Sales in our portfolio were up 10.7% for the year and this flowed through to the rents we received which increased 11.8% for the year. Our occupancy rate as of December 31, 2008, was 97% and our NOI increased 13.6% over the fourth quarter of 2007’s operating results. We continue to make significant progress at our nearly completed development project in Manaus. The 466,000 square feet development is currently 82% leased with commitments which are comprised of signed leases and LOIs totaling 94%. All eight anchors have been signed, which include Marisa, Renter, C&A, Villa Suelo, Baymo, High Tech, and Sentaro. We anticipate the shopping center to open in April with a leased rate in the mid-90s. We have closed on 112.3 million reals construction loan for our Manaus development project at an effective rate of 8.5%. Brazil aside, however, we continue to see and hear about considerable distress in the U.S. retail market. Some claims are legitimate and some are not. However, even with our current box challenges in regard to releasing, we continue to make progress, have confidence in our real estate, continue to value retailers who are clearly favored by the consumer in this environment, and most importantly have the leasing platform and individuals to deliver results and mitigate down time to the greatest extent possible. At this time I would like to turn the call over to David.
David J. Oakes: As you have heard throughout the call, our top priorities are in lowering leverage and improving liquidity. First and foremost, our strategy is address the items that are within our control such as dividend policy, development expenditures, listing assets for sale, and purchasing near-term maturities at discount to par. We have repaid our January 2009 unsecured notes in full and we do not have any major debt maturities until May 2010. We are taking advantage of this as we know to conserve capital, generate proceeds from asset sales, and raise new equity and debt proceeds as shown by the recently announced capital raise and new mortgage debt with the Otto family. Based upon our reasonable expectations for operating cash flow and the proceeds from the Otto transaction, we believe that we are in a position to meet all our maturities through at least the end of 2010 and will be working diligently during that period to generate considerable additional proceeds that can address future maturities. An important part of our strategy includes the sale of non-core assets. These transactions generate proceeds and allow us to improve portfolio quality. We sold $200.0 million of assets in 2008 resulting in net proceeds to DDR of $136.0 million with a weighted average cap rate of less than 7%. In January, we sold an operating asset providing $22.0 million of net proceeds to DDR and with our joint venture with MET we sold five former Mervyn’s locations. In February we sold another asset in a joint venture for $8.0 million at a cap rate just above 8%. We continue to work on several hundred million dollars of asset sales and remain comfortable with our ability to generate over $200.0 million of sales for the year. We expect to achieve average cap rates from 7.5% to 9% range on these sales. Our recently expanded transactions team is working diligently to complete these asset sales and this continues to represent a relatively attractive source and cost of capital to help meet our deleveraging goals. We expect to receive a similar or greater amount of net proceeds in 2009 as we did in 2008. Yet another strategic initiative includes the transaction with the Otto family that Scott announced earlier. These transactions in aggregate will result in approximately $175.0 million of new capital which will be used to lower leverage and extend debt duration, including buying near-term unsecured debt at a discount and reducing unsecured revolving credit balances. I would like to take a moment to further explain these transactions. We entered into a binding purchase agreement with the Otto family of Germany for the sale of 30.0 million common shares and for warrants entitling the Otto family to purchase an additional 10.0 million common shares. The 30.0 million shares will be sold to the Otto family in one or two tranches, at the option of the Otto family. If the transaction closes in two tranches, the first is expected to close in April and will include 15.0 million shares. The second will close in the following six months and include the remaining 15.0 million shares. The shares will be priced at $3.50 for the first closing and $4.00 for the second closing, representing premiums of 33% and 52% relative to Friday’s closing price of $2.53 per share. The Otto family will be entitled to any dividends declared from the date of the purchase agreement. We will also issue warrants to the Otto family for the purchases of 10.0 million additional shares, to be granted in two tranches covering 5.0 million shares each upon each of the two closings I just mentioned. Each warrant gives the holder the right to purchase a share of common stock at $6.00 any time in the next five years. This price represents a 128% premium to Friday’s close. As proceeds are received from each of these transactions, they will be used to repay debt, some of which we expect will be purchased at a discount to par. The Otto family will have the right to hold two seats on DDR’s Board of Directors as long as they retain certain ownership levels. We look forward to the expertise and diversity that they will bring to our company based upon the successes they have achieved as shopping center developers and managers and retailers throughout the world. The new five-year mortgage loan that the Otto family will fund for one of our large shopping centers is also expected to close in April and will provide additional liquidity in an otherwise constrained lending market. The current common equity dribble program will remain in place for use as needed. In December we sold 8.6 million shares and received net proceeds of $43.0 million. The program provides for an additional $157.0 million of additional equity issuance. Despite deteriorating market conditions, new capital has continued to be available to DDR. In 2008 we raised $1.2 billion of new mortgage capital. Our assumptions and requirements for 2009 are much lower and our diverse lending relationships will help us uncover new capital through the variety of life insurance companies, regional, national, and international banks, including new international relationships with Brazilian lenders that were created in 2008. We also believe that our new relationship with the Otto family will likely uncover some new financing sources. As evidenced by the $1.2 billion of new mortgage capital rates last year, we have the support of our lenders, both large and small, to get through this challenging part of the cycle. We have seen renewed interest in financing opportunities from life companies so far in 2009 and would expect to do more business with this group. Conversations involve spreads in 300 basis point to 500 basis point range and loan to values in the 50% to 60% range with cap rates of 7% to 8% depending on property type and tenant profile. We are in the market now with several loan packages and expect to close new long-term mortgages beginning the second quarter of 2009. Also encouraging are the direct conversations we have had with note holders on a portion of our CMBS set regarding the ability to extend maturities beyond their contractual deadline. We have already successfully extended a loan that was due in February for one year at the existing terms, including its prior rate, which would be well below the current market. I would also like to take a moment to provide an update on MBT. It was announced in December that MBT is undergoing a strategic review. We have considerable rights in this joint venture but are supportive of their process and look forward to either a better capitalized partner or a graceful exit so that their maturity issues no longer overly burden our debt schedule. We expect that 2009 will be a challenging year but we believe that we are prepared and will emerge a stronger company. We will be prudently evaluating all sources and uses to improve liquidity and lower leverage and model conservative assumptions to ensure that we will be able to address all of our near-term needs, even in the event of current financial market dislocation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott A. Wolstein: As you have all heard during today’s call, our operating portfolio is performing relatively well despite the challenging operating environment. We have taken significant steps to enhance our financial flexibility through the various means mentioned on today’s call, including the two significant capital transactions with the Otto family. We are pleased to announce that we have the capacity to meet all our debt maturities for at least the next two years and we plan to emerge from these challenging times as a stronger company. Based upon this activity, we expect operating FFO per share for 2009 to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25 per share, although gains from debt repurchase could result in much higher reported results. The key assumptions that drive this guidance include a decline in same store NOI of 3% to 4% and an occupancy level of approximately 90% as well as significant delivering transactions as outlined earlier. Reported FFO is likely to once again include various NOIs from gains and losses so our guidance and business plan are focused on this more core metric. At this point we will open the line to receive your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: I’m here with Johann as well. Can you specifically walk through the stock sale, the other alternatives you considered. Obviously the timing at this point, given that you mentioned you have two years in terms of really being able to deal with debt here in the near term, but also referencing NAV, because again, the stock sale issuing 30.0 million shares, it doesn’t really seem to put much of a dent into what’s going to be coming due in 2011 and 2012.
Scott A. Wolstein: Which question do you want us to answer first? 2011 and 2012 or?
Jay Habermann: Well, could you start first with again, the stock sale and how you arrived at the price? How this came together at this point?
Scott A. Wolstein: With respect to this transaction, this negotiation has been going on since last fall. We have had a relationship with ECE through our joint venture in Russia and through that relationship we have developed a very cordial relationship with the Otto family and this transaction has been, like I said, in the works for quite some time. The transaction was executed at a significant premium to market, had the market been higher, the price would have been higher. But the market is what it is and we have to live in the world we live in and not the world we would like it be. I think that we have plans to address all of our debt maturities through 2011 and 2012 but at the moment this transaction and the proceeds available to us today take us through 2010, which we think is the horizon that most companies are looking at at the moment and we think it’s appropriate to deal with that today on today’s call. We certainly wouldn’t have, or shouldn’t have, issued enough equity in this transaction to deal with 2011 and 2012 maturities because that would have been far more dilutive and I think we were quite fortunate to find an investor who didn’t think the world was coming to an end and didn’t think that you had to solve for the next four years in order to make an investment today. Frankly, I think that kind of investor is very difficult to execute with and that’s why you haven’t seen any transactions of that nature and I don’t think you will. We couldn’t be more excited to have a strategic partner like the Otto family and we are absolutely confident that together we will be able to access whatever capital we need to deal with our debt maturities in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and for the end of time. And we couldn’t be more excited to be in that position.
Jay Habermann: Was the decision really more that you couldn’t get the asset sales done? Is that what sort of precipitated the stock sale?
Scott A. Wolstein: No, it has nothing to do with it. We had negotiations going on on the stock sale long before the DRA deal even cratered, to be quite honest with you. I mean, this was a strategic investment by the Otto family that we have been discussing for some time and it has nothing to do with asset sales. We both continue to be successful in completing assets sales, as we have been, and one thing has nothing to do with the other.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank.
Lou Taylor: With regards to this stock sale, has there been any consideration at the Board level to offer the existing shareholders the right to inject more capital under similar terms?
Scott A. Wolstein: Well, the Board would certainly consider issuing equity in various ways to various constituencies as they arise. And we have had conversations with other shareholders who have indicated an interest in investing in the company. Frankly, I think the appetite of those investors has been significantly enhanced by this transaction because they now feel that any investment they would make would be part of a permanent solution. And I’m sure those kinds of conversations will continue and if the Board feels they’re in the shareholders’ best interest, I’m sure that we will pursue them.
Lou Taylor: And as a follow-up, in terms of the unencumbered asset ploy you have alluded to, because of the size and capacity there, how far along are you in terms of actually accessing that and bringing new capital into the company?
David J. Oakes: It’s obviously a challenging and dislocating environment but we have got packages out on a number of our larger and what we would deem more financeable assets from within that pool, either as part of a pooled transaction for a larger-term loan, or for individual one-off mortgage debt. So it’s something that is in the works right now and we would expect to begin to receive proceeds in the second quarter of 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Quentin Velleley is on the phone with me as well. Scott, I can appreciate the fact that his transaction was in process for a little while, sounds like back to last year and given the fact that the market has come down, it sort of forced your hand a little bit in terms of pricing relative to where the stock had been. I’m just curious, the overall level of proceeds, it’s not relative to the entire company, I would say how you balance holding off an getting some other asset sales done, given the fact that it’s only upfront about $112.0 million from the equity, to try to do other things rather than selling 20% of the company at this price.
Scott A. Wolstein: Well, you know, these are all difficult decisions and as you can appreciate, but I do think first of all, you know we have been approached by multiple lenders who have said that they would be willing to consider additional secured indebtedness to our company if we could produce additional equity, so I think the right way to look at this is not just $112.0 million of equity but at least double that in new proceeds. Because I am sure we will be successful in accessing additional debt capital as a result of this transaction, that would have been more difficult without this transaction. With respect to the either or between raising equity and selling assets, that’s a false choice. We are aggressively pursuing asset sales and will continue to do so and the Otto family and DDR together are of the same mind in that regard. That is certainly a very efficient way for us to raise capital to address liquidity needs into the future and we will continue to do that. What this transaction does is it removes some of the leverage from the buyers of those assets in those negotiations to enable us to get better terms and it gives us more time to do that. So it isn’t one or the other and I have to tell you, in terms of saying if we should have waited, I guess my answer to that is hope is not a strategy. I think a lot of companies who think things are going to get better are mistaken. I think that we are in an unprecedented financial crisis and I think it was absolutely imperative for this company to take a bold step and I think we were incredibility fortunate that of all the real estate companies in the United States, the Otto family who could have invested in any company chose our company as a place to put a stake in the ground for their future United States real estate investments in retail. So we couldn’t be more gratified, we couldn’t be more excited. We wish we could have sold stock at $30 a share. I mean, I don’t want to minimize the humility that it takes to issue stock at $3.50 a share when you were trading at $72 a share not long ago, but again, we have to operate in the world where we live, and the world where we live is very different than that world. And we think in this world when you have the opportunity to put $175.0 million in new capital to work to go out and delever your balance sheet at a multiple of that amount because of the incredibly attractive discounts that are available on our debt in the marketplace, it would be imprudent not to do so. And even at this price, that issuance of equity will be highly accretive in the long run for that reason.
Michael Bilerman: The press release talks about some of the closing conditions for the deal and one of them says including the receipt by the company of additional debt financing. Can you just clarify what the conditions to close are specifically on this one?
Scott A. Wolstein: Yes, on that point it’s exactly what I just mentioned, is that when we have to come up with debt financing in an equal amount to the equity financing and we have had multiple proposals from lenders to do that.
David J. Oakes: And all of the complete details of the transaction will be filed in an 8-K as well as a proxy where shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the transactions, so the entire details will be out there in the next 24 hours.
Michael Bilerman: Was there any discussion about maybe just buying the whole company and just taking it private, with the Otto family?
Scott A. Wolstein: No there wasn’t.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carol Campbell - Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Campbell: Your 2009 FFO guidance, does that include any dilution from this Otto transaction?
Scott A. Wolstein: Yes. It includes dilution from the Otto transaction and additional equity issuance.
Carol Campbell: At this point do you have any joint ventures in the pipeline or any companies coming to you wanting to do joint ventures?
Scott A. Wolstein: We are always involved in extensive negotiations along those lines.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller – JP Morgan.
Michael Mueller: In the comments about the stock sale you kept referring to the first tranche and second tranche closing. Is it the expectation that it will close in two tranches and what happens to pricing if it closes in one tranche? Does it go with the $3.50 price.
Scott A. Wolstein: No, it’s highly likely to close in two tranches and it has no effect on price if it closes in one tranche.
Michael Mueller: In terms of additional equity issuance, David, I think you mentioned the dribble program. Is any of that embedded in the guidance as well or is that just kind of not in the numbers at this point?
William H. Schafer: The current guidance includes the equity issuance reflected in the transaction with Alexander Otto and his family was well as a stock dividend throughout the year.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Lou Taylor - Deutsche Bank.
Lou Taylor: In terms of the topic of the dividend, you had kind of alluded to what the minimum tax dividend would be for this year. Just given guidance and your budget for the year, where do you see that minimum tax dividend being on a per share basis?
William H. Schafer: We’ve still got a number of moving parts there but we expect to formally declare the dividend in the next several weeks, based on what exactly that calculation of taxable income is and what minimal buffer we want to make sure we have with the moving pieces, including the operating environment but also the exact timing of when the shares are outstanding, based upon the transaction with the Otto family.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Looking more on the operations front for just a minute, you still have two big development pipelines out there and I’m curious, could you tell us a little bit about how you feel about what you have under construction in terms of ongoing tenant interest and whether or not you think all of those developments are still viable and if you may have impairments possibly in some of those remaining?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: In the development pipeline that is currently under construction our leased rate is in the high 70 percentile. And we still do have tenant interest. A lot from the tenants that we had explained are interested in our vacant boxes as well. And there are tenants that are still expanding and there are tenants that are still looking for product. We don’t currently envision any additional impairments on that pipeline.
Rich Moore: So is anybody, Dan, especially any of the anchor-type tenants showing any thought about possibly pulling out of some of those developments or are they still hanging in there for the most part?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: They’re hanging in there for those developments and they are obligated to do so contractually. The areas where we had some anchor tenants that were getting squirrely on some of the deals were some of the ones that Bill mentioned earlier where we dropped the projects and we did take some charges, but the ones that are coming out of the ground have fixed dates, they have delivery dates, they have tenant opening dates and contractual obligations of our tenants to meet those dates.
Rich Moore: And that’s on the JD side as well I take it?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That’s correct.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: In terms of the line of credit and the renewal of that, in terms of the extension, was there anything that the equity offering was needed to push you in from a covenant perspective for that to occur?
William H. Schafer: No, it was not required for any reason. The extension of the line of credit and any other extendable debt is exclusively related to our compliance with the covenants on each piece of debt and we are compliant today and based on all of our projections, firmly expect to be continue to be compliant, which puts that, you know, our option to extend the line of credit from 2010 to 2011.
Michael Bilerman: Can you just talk a little bit about same store in why it was up for the year. I was just having trouble trying to reconcile that with the occupancy decline during the year. It sounds like some currency impact in Brazil, and some of the other things that were going on, how that actually went up during the year?
William H. Schafer: Well, the currency impact in Brazil was really just a fourth quarter anomaly, if you will, and actually Brazil performed very well. I think as Dan indicated, it was in the mid-teens on a same store NOI perspective. And that was something that did really bring our overall same store number up a little bit. I think there’s about $50.0 million to $55.0 million of rents or something in that ballpark.
Michael Bilerman: I guess I was thinking more so about as of the nine months in September 30 you had about 1.8% growth and for the full year at 1.7%, but the fourth quarter is a more dramatic decline in occupancy both sequentially and year-over-year and I was just trying to figure out how all that played together.
William H. Schafer: Well, again, from an NOI perspective you’ve got to understand there’s a lot of those tenants who were in there pretty much through the holiday season, so a lot of that I think came out much later in the fourth quarter. Certainly it was a little bit early but from the overall average perspective the majority of tenants were in there for the fourth quarter.
Scott A. Wolstein: It’s a fair question but I think if you look at what we gave you in guidance, most of the occupancy lost is reflected in our 2009 guidance and most of that happened at the end of 2008.
Michael Bilerman: And in terms of dividend, so the $1.50 that you put out maybe a quarter ago, it sounds like that will be revised down to whatever your estimate of taxable net income is and then 90% of that will be paid in stocks.
William H. Schafer: In terms of what actually came out, the Board indicated an intent to declare a dividend that is around our minimum payout for retaining REIT status and at that time that equated to roughly $1.50 a share, which we had referenced on the prior call. That with the share count of about 120.0 million shares outstanding at that point and so the single biggest factor that you will have changing that is simply the shares that were issued toward the end of 2008 as well as the timing of when the Otto transaction closes and when those additional shares are outstanding. So operating results reasonably consistent but other moving pieces that affect that per share calculation.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan - Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan: Curious what consideration, if any, was given to the option of doing a REITs offering, which would have allowed your existing shareholders the option to not be diluted as they are through this transaction.
Scott A. Wolstein: Well, first of all I don’t think our shareholders are diluted by this transaction. At last count our shares were trading at a significant discount to the price of this deal and any of our shareholders could buy it at cheaper price in the market as far as I can tell. So in terms of giving them an opportunity to invest in the company alongside this investor, we haven’t ruled that out. That is a possibility. And as I said before, we have had very constructive discussions with shareholders who were interested in participating in a transaction which would be led by a strong lead order, which we have delivered. So I don’t think we have diluted anybody. I mean, your earnings may be diluted by issuing equity but any time you delever your balance sheet it’s dilutive to earnings. And I don’t think anybody would suggest that that’s not a noble endeavor in this environment. But had we offered shareholders an opportunity to participate in an offering at 50% premium to the share price, I’m not sure there would have been a good response. But now that this transaction has been announced, I think we will have a much more enthusiastic response.
David J. Oakes: At both the Board level and senior management we considered a very broad range of potential solutions to the problems that we were getting, that we were concerned about and that were clearly reflected in the market price on a daily basis. We did consider a REITs issuance. I think there was some concern about the potentially course of nature of a REITs issuance as a forced capital call for existing share holders and so we considered a broad range of solutions and we thought this was a relatively attractive one, both because of the amount of capital coming in from one investor as well as the extreme synergies between these two organizations and the ability of the Otto group, through ECE, Paramount, and all of their various organizations to help us to become an even more world-class operator and developer.
Jim Sullivan: And there’s a lot of ways to measure dilution. I think selling 20% of the company at $3.50 and $4.00 a share, there are a lot of ways to conclude that’s dilutive but I won’t debate it on the call. And I think I heard you say that there are a bunch of retailers that would be eager to open 50+ stores if the development activity allowed them to. Did I hear you correctly and if so, who are some of those retailers?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You did hear me correctly. The T.J. Maxx Company, Hobby Lobby, Bed, Bath & Beyond and all their divisions, Best Buy, Dick’s Sporting Goods, etc. It’s a number of them.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Jay Habermann - Goldman Sachs/
Jay Habermann: You mentioned the two new Board members. Are you anticipating changes at the senior management level as part of this transaction?
Scott A. Wolstein: No.
Jay Habermann: Can you comment, Dan, you mentioned rent reductions and on prior calls you have talked about wanting to maintain occupancy. Can we assume from those comments that obviously you are looking to accept those reductions?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: No, we are doing an analysis to see how many of those are real. What’s happening is a lot of tenants whose balance sheets are just fine are asking for rent reductions because in today’s environment you almost feel somewhat foolish if you don’t ask for one. And we have a number of tenants who have asked for rent reductions and when we say no they sort of go along their merry way, not leaving the center but just continuing to pay what their contractual obligations call for. So we are less inclined that you would think to grant rent reductions because the majority of the tenants that are requesting them are not at the level of financial distress that they would want us to believe.
Jay Habermann: What sort of magnitude are they asking for when they come to you for reduction?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It’s sort of all over the board, anywhere from 10% to 20% is sort of a typical ask and for only a one-year term because they assume they will come back to us at the end of the one year and if things are still bad they’ll ask again. So the rent reductions that we have been giving so far have been only for a one-year term. But there’s only been a few of the, out of the 400 that have requested. But again, a lot of our joint venture partners, like I mentioned in the script, a lot of the joint venture partners are extraordinarily concerned about maintaining occupancy and they may be a little more forgiving on some of these requests than we would in the core.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities.
Jeff Donnelly: Just a point of clarification. I think you said in your prepared remarks that you could meet your 2009 and 2010 maturities, provided a series of conditions were met. Is that inclusive of all your obligations under joint ventures as well, at your pro rata share of the debt or under what is potentially recourse to DDR?
William H. Schafer: That is correct. It includes not just what is recourse to DDR but the entire amount of pro rata mortgage maturities at our joint venture partners.
Scott A. Wolstein: And just to be clear, as I said in the script, it assumes that we can refinance 60% of all of that consolidated and joint venture debt with new secured financing.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Michael Mueller – JP Morgan
Michael Mueller: Dan, the guidance in terms of the occupancy outlook for 2009, what have you assume in there beyond what’s known at this point?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We have assumed about a 200 basis point decline beyond what we currently know.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call."
6,SITC,1,2009,2009-04-24 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the first quarter 2009 Developers Diversified Realty earnings conference call. My name is Towanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Tom Morabito, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Tom Morabito: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. With me on today’s call are Chairman and CEO, Scott Wolstein; President and Chief Operating Officer, Dan Hurwitz; Chief Financial Officer, Bill Schafer; and, Chief Investment Officer, David Oakes. Following our prepared remarks, we will then conduct the Q&A session. Before we get started, I need to remind everyone that some of our statements today may be forward-looking in nature. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, we should understand that those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual result may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Finally, please note that on today’s call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures including FFO. Reconciliation for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can also be found in the earnings release. The release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our Web site at ddr.com. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Wolstein: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us today. To begin, I would like to briefly discuss first quarter operating results, which was quite solid despite the macroeconomic challenges and the large distortion by some significant tenant bankruptcies. FFO for the first quarter of 2009 was a $1.08 per share including gains and debt extinguishment and impairment related charges, which compares to last year’s first quarter restated at the fall of $0.80 per share. Excluding $17.5 million of impairment related charges and $72.6 million of debt gain, FFO was $0.66 per share for the first quarter of 2009. All told, the quarter came in as expected given the environment and we will walk you through the details in a few minutes. Next, I would like to update you on our progress regarding the strategic investment by the Otto family. Our shareholders overwhelmingly approved the transaction, with more than 95% of votes in favor. We expect the first tranche of 15 million shares to be posted to the Otto family at $3.50 a share within the next few weeks, which will be concurrent with our closing at approximately $125 million of new secured debt financing. The new secured debt consists of two transactions. In both cases, full lender committee approval has been obtained. In addition, a $60 million five-year loan provided by an affiliate of the Otto family, replacing the $60 million bridge loans entered into last month with the Otto family, foreclosed the loan with the other debt and equity closing. Proceeds from the bridge loans and asset sales were used to purchase over $150 million of our bonds in March, when discounts to par were extremely attractive. The second tranche of $50 million shares will be sold to the Otto family within six months of the first closing. We will also be granting warrants to the Otto family for 5 million additional shares, and is closing with an exercise price of $6 per share. As we announced during our fourth quarter earnings call, our recent capital markets activities have addressed all of our debt maturities to at least the end of 2010. We are pleased with our progress to date and expect to have considerable additional activity to announce in the next few quarters to proactively address our 2011 and 2012 maturities. We are actively pursuing capital raising initiatives through a broad range of potential opportunities in markets at both the assets and corporate level. First, we sold over $67 million of assets in the first quarter at a weighted average cap rate of 8%. Concurrently, we have over $175 million of assets under contract or subject to letter of intent. As a result, we are well on pace to complete our expected $200 million of asset sales in 2009. Second, in addition to the $125 million of new mortgage debt closing in early May, we will obtain significant additional new mortgage debt within the coming quarters. Some of that debt are already has written proposals from lenders in various stages of negotiations. Third, in addition to the $112 million of equities from the Otto family, our continuous equity program remains in place. And we have the capacity to issue over $115 million worth of new shares that we have not utilized as yet in 2009. Though we realize the high cost of equity capital in the current environment, we’ll consider more equity related transactions as we strive to ensure the utmost financial flexibility. Fourth, we expect to retain approximately $250 million of free cash flow in 2009 as we maintain our current dividend policy. Finally, we continue to have interest in repurchasing our unsecured notes with significant discounts to par. During the first quarter, we bought back over $160 million of our bonds, maturing in 2010, 2011, and 2012, at a weighted average price of 51%. To all of these items I just mentioned, along with conservative financing assumptions, the required equity injections into any asset with maturing mortgage debt, we have addressed all of our remaining 2009 and 2010 maturities and our focus on attacking the 2011 and 2012 maturities was bigger. David will expand more upon these activities later in the call. But first, I will turn it over to Bill, who will take you through our first quarter operating results.
Bill Schafer: Thanks, Scott. I’ll begin by discussing first quarter operating results. As Scott mentioned, our first quarter 2009 FFO was a $1.08 per share. As indicated in our earnings release, after adjusting to excluded impairment related charges and gains on debt repurchases, FFO was $0.66 per share. The impairment related charges of $17.5 million were primarily related to impairments and losses taken on both fully owned and joint-venture assets, which were disposed off or are being marketed for sale. It is worth mentioning that, although we incurred impairment related charges of approximately $17.5 million, we also had gains on the sale of assets of over $12.3 million, which were not included in FFO. The net gains on debt repurchase of $72.6 million, actually equates to over $80 million of gains based on the face amount of debt repurchase, which Scott mentioned earlier. Turning now to operating results for the first quarter, same store NOI for the quarter was down 2.2%, which is on track with guidance we issued on last earning’s call, in which we indicated a decrease of 3 to 4%. Our Brazil portfolio performed exceptionally well, with same store NOI increases of over 12%. Ancillary income was up over 9% from last year and G&A expense is down approximately 7% from last year. The reduction in G&A is attributed to the termination of a supplemental equity award plan at the end 2008, a lower head count, and a reduction in general corporate expenses. Next, I’d like to call your attention to two changes in the financial statements this quarter. First, our interest expense was increased by a non-cash $3.9 million charge due to the change in accounting for convertible debt instruments. This also required us to restate our 2008 results, which resulted in a non-cash $3.3 million increase to interest expense in 2008, or approximately $0.03 per share. FFO per share was reduced to $0.80 for the first quarter of 2008 as compared to the $0.83 reported last year. Second, minority interest is now referred to as non-controlling interest. And from a balance sheet perspective, $133.5 million is now included as part of shareholders equity. I’d like to take a moment to address upcoming non-recurring charges that we expect to occur later in 2009. In connection with the Otto transaction, and as reflected in the related proxy, a change in control with regards to our equity awards plan has occurred. As a result, we will incur a $10.5 million non-cash charge in the second quarter of this year and $4.7 million non-cash charge in the second half of the year. No cash is being paid out to current employees as part of this change in control trigger under our equity award plan. Moving to on to capital markets, we recognized the covenant compliance continues to be an area of concern among the investment community. We are able to provide the following information. We are compliant with both bank facility and unsecured note covenants as of the first quarter. Our tightest ratios have been the consolidated indebtedness ratio and the unencumbered asset coverage ratio in our bank facility covenants. For each of these ratios, there has been trending improvement from the third quarter of 2008 to Q4 of 2008, and again through March 31, 2009. The consolidated indebtedness ratio reads as follows, consolidated indebtedness must not exceed 60% of consolidated market value, provided that such percentage can be up to 65% for two quarters during the term of the facility. We have never exceeded 60% during the term of our facility and our calculations indicate that we were below 58% on this ratio as of March 31. The unencumbered asset coverage ratio provides that the value of unencumbered assets must be greater than or equal to 1.6 times consolidated unsecured indebtedness. Our calculations indicate that we are above 1.65 times on this ratio as of March 31. Our unencumbered assets pool was over $5.5 billion as of March 31. While this is lower than prior quarters, primarily due to increase in secured debt and asset sales, we have reduced our unsecured debt from $3.5 billion to $3.3 billion and improved this ratio. We could add roughly $700 million of secured debt without assuming any corresponding increase in consolidated market valuable before violating our secured indebtedness covenants. We expect the ratios to improve throughout 2009 as we continue to retain more capital, close the Otto transaction and additional debt financings, and continue to sell assets. Our cash on hand in revolver capacity was approximately $100 million at quarter end. We realize that this is low, but we made a strategic decision to take advantage of one of the few benefits that this economic environment provides, which is the ability to repurchase our near term public debt at significant discounts. We have taken advantage of this opportunity through the dramatic slowdown of development spending, reduction of cash dividends, health of acquisitions, the increasing volume of asset sales, and the issuance of new debt. Throughout 2009, we will see us continue to focus on buying notes at a discount, and at the same time reducing our revolver balances. Last week, we announced the results of our first quarter 2009 dividend election. We paid approximately $2.6 million in cash and $23.2 million in common shares, which resulted in $8.3 million additional common shares outstanding. Finally, I’d like to give an update on our development disclosure. We’ve removed five projects out of projects in progress in the supplement. Four of these were re-classified as land or construction projects on hold as we no longer expect near term commencement of vertical construction. The other project, Midtown Miami, has been moved to operating assets as most of the capital budget for the project has been spent and most major anchors have opened. Development funding will be little, if any, in the near term and we have slightly over $40 million budgeted for the rest of 2009 for the remaining centers that are shown in the projects and progress chart in the supplemental. I’ll now turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Hurwitz: Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I’d like to start by providing an update on what we’re seeing in the leasing environment as retails continue to face tremendous headwinds due to decreased consumer spending and deteriorating economic fundamentals. While we have already seen our share of retail bankruptcies, the industry as a whole expected to see more fallout during the first quarter of 2009. And while there are retailers currently facing severely deteriorating operating fundamentals, a significant portion of our core retailers continue to prove their resilience amid the challenging economic climate as evidenced by the deal velocity we experienced during the first quarter. While many of the headlines addressing retailer health suggest that retailers are simply not expanding, our leasing team delivered a remarkably strong quarter, both in terms of deal volume and square footage, indicating that retailers are in fact continuing to look for the right growth opportunities. But obviously, at a price. Specifically, we signed 124 new leases during the quarter, representing over 570,000 square feet of GLA at an average spread of negative 60 basis points. Additionally, there were 227 renewed deals executed during the quarter, representing well over 1.3 million square feet of GLA at an average spread of 90 basis points. On a blended basis, there were 351 deals executed during the first quarter representing nearly 2 million square feet of GLA at an average spread of 58 basis points. Compared to Q4, we executed 42 more leases and filled 34,000 more square feet of GLA. We expect occupancy to remain around 90% for the next few quarters with rentals spreads remaining modestly positive to slightly negative as we focus on improving occupancy and minimizing CapEx. Overall we are very encouraged by the level of leasing activity we experienced for the quarter. While the resulting rent spreads were much less than we had historically achieved, the volume of deals was quite strong given the fact that we had not yet regained control of all the space that was rejected during the bankruptcy process. In addition, our leasing expenses in terms of CapEx, which was one one-third of what we would historically have spent on the number of leases executed for the quarter. As you can see from these results, in contrary to what some of the headlines may say, there are retailers still interested in doing deals. Discount retailers are taking new advantage of consumers trading down and are opportunistically growing as a result. Categories such as linens and consumer electronics are taking advantage of the unique opportunity to gain market share from their former competitors. The most active retailers include Bed Bath & Beyond and its various concepts, Best Buy, Forever 21, HH Gregg, Hobby Lobby, Joan’s Stores, Nordstrom Rack, Ross Dress for Less; regionally and specialty grocers such as Sprouts, WinCo and El Super. Also very active is Staples and the TJX Companies, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright and Home Goods. We have multiple executed leases or an active lease or LOI negotiations with each of these retailers that I just mentioned. We continue to stand in front of these and other active tenants through portfolio reviews and face-to-face meetings to communicate strategic initiatives and enhanced business relationships. To date, we have 33 formal portfolio reviews and numerous meetings either completed or planned for the near future, particularly at the upcoming Recon [ph] conference. While some retailers are more bullish than others, we continue to hear from a large majority of retailers during these meetings, that their reduced door openings are not a result of strained operating fundamentals but rather due to the lack of new growth opportunities. On a similar note, addressing overall retailer health, our industry has consistently focused on headline sales figures and earnings growth as a barometer for future growth plans. As many of you have heard me say before, the leading metric of same store sales is not a good measure of retailer health, particularly in this economic climate for a variety of reasons. First, retailers continue to improve supply chain efficiencies led by inventory management, which is driving margin of growth rather than sales volume. Second, as economy continues to contract, retailers are counting their numbers from distressed quarters, from which their inventory levels deviate greatly from current operating metrics. And lastly, retailers are beginning to face difficult year-over-year comparisons as a result of last year’s tax rebate checks which were mailed in the second quarter of 2008 calendar year. Overall, although retail sales in some cases are in fact falling, many retailers may actually be experiencing margin growth, achieving plan, and enhancing the quality of their credit. Despite the fact that retailers are opening new stores, we are still feeling the effects of retailer bankruptcies that impacted our portfolio in 2008 and early 2009. As of the end of the first quarter, the leased rate for our shopping center portfolio stands at 90.7%. This figure includes the bankruptcies of Goody’s, Linens ‘n Things, Circuit City and Steve & Barry’s. With the inclusion of the now vacant Mervyns stores, we stand at 88.4%, which is a historical up. However, when reviewing our occupancy statistics, it’s interesting to note that excluding the five major vacancies created by the bankruptcies I just described, which will be resolved over time, our portfolio remains at 94.8% leased. 44% of our total vacancy is related to those bankruptcies, which highlight a tenant specific issue and not a real estate issue. In terms of addressing the big box vacancies in our portfolio, our anchor store re-development team is working diligently to back build the space. As I have mentioned in previous calls, we formed this group during the third quarter of 2008 to proactively address the unprecedented number of junior anchor and anchor spaces that have been returned to us primarily due to the bankruptcies of many high profile retailers. We are working creatively to re-tenant these spaces with strong credit tenants, and through collaboration with our retail partners, we are finding ways to maximize the re-use of existing improvements and minimize capital expenditures. Of the 50 Circuit City locations that were in our portfolio, we regained possession of 43 locations in early March. During the first quarter, three of these units were released to Bed Bath & Beyond, HH Gregg, and Joan’s Stores. And another three are in process. To date, we also have 25 active letters of intent on 16 locations representing 557,000 feet of former Circuit City spaces. The 38 former Mervyns spaces in our portfolio are garnering interest from retailers looking to take over quality real estate in the California market. Many of these locations are in markets of high various entry and we are seeing apparel chains such as Kohl’s and Forever21 as well as grocers eager to expand their footprint and gain market share. As of January 1st, when we regain possession of majority of the Mervyns boxes, we sold five former locations to Kohl’s, are in active negotiations to sell two more locations to another retailer. We also leased locations to Forever21 and Hobby Lobby. In total, these nine locations represent 23% of the total Mervyns space. To date, we also have 25 active letters of intent out on 13 additional locations. Eight of the 38 former Linens ‘n Things locations are currently at lease, which represents 21% of the space formerly occupied by Linens. We also have 11 active letters of intent in negotiation for several locations representing in additional 243,000 square feet. We regained possession of the 21 of the 38 former Goody’s locations in the first quarter. To date, we have leased three units to retailers eager to expand into the South such as Hobby Lobby, and have nine active letters of intent on several locations accounting for an additional 263,000 square feet of space. In total, within our anchor store re-development group portfolio, we have approximately 3.3 million square feet of letters of intent in active negotiations, 582,000 square feet in lease negotiations, and 700,000 square feet of FCQed [ph] releases were sales of single tenant boxes, which accounts for approximately 39% of our total big box vacancy. With the lack of new development opportunities and challenging internal growth prospects in a price deflationary environment, we are seeing more tenant interest in our vacant box portfolio than originally anticipated. We've foreseen no change in the current dormant status of new development projects, which should be a catalyst for future interest in these locations. It’s important to note the increase in credit quality of the retailers that are backfilling these spaces. The vast majority of the replacement tenants for the boxes are national retailers and are survivors in their respective categories. These investment class retailers have a strong sustainable credit profile and will enhance our leasing efforts on the balance of our shopping centers. It’s also important to note, that while we continue to market our big box vacancies to long-term prospects, our new business development team has generated in excess of $1.4 million in revenue commitments from temporary tenants filling space in our anchor store re-development portfolio. I'd like to take a minute to address the growing concerns surrounding potential co-tenancy impact across the retail landscape. While few co-tenancy issues at our center have been triggered as a result of recent bankruptcies, annual base rental revenue has been impacted by less than 1% as a result of tenants paying alternative rent. A co-tenancy cause is not typically triggered by a single junior anchor such as Linens n’ Things or Circuit City leaving a center. Rather, this is typically tied to a series of main junior anchors for big box anchor tenants, and generally results to a retailer paying an alternative rent typically for a period of one year until the co-tenancy is cured in which case the tenant must revert back to minimum rent. An example of alternative rent would be 2% to 5% of gross sales. If after one year the co-tenancy is not cured, the tenant has the option to vacate its space or return to its contractual rent. The latter is often chosen as it is far less expensive than closing or relocating a profitable store. Even if the store is unprofitable, the tenant will usually attempt to renegotiate the rent in hopes of achieving profitability before deciding to terminate. This gives us the option of keeping the tenant at a reduced rate if we feel it is in the best interest of the asset. I'd now like to take the moment to address a common misconception within our industry as it relates to rent relief requests. Many retailers will tell you that they are asking for rent relief. And they are in record numbers. To date, we've received 672 requests for rent relief, rent abatement, and rent deferrals. 525 of these requests have come from local tenants while the remaining 147 have come from national tenants. We evaluate each requests on a case by case basis and ask that each retailer provide us statements, sales history, tax returns, any business plans stating their strategy to increase sales, and reduced variable expenses going forward, such that we can make a prudent business decision. More often than not, we do not receive the items requested and the rent relief request is denied or goes away on its own. There is a disconnect between tenants and landlords regarding the number of requests that are actually granted. Many retailers and their advisors will tell you they're successful in renegotiating relief terms. However, to date, we have granted only 20 rent relief requests, or less than 3% of the total requests received. The typical concession is for a period of one year and is generally in the form of a deferred payment. It is also important to note that many of the requests we process must be reviewed and decided upon by our joint venture partners. In summary, we fully acknowledge the challenges we've faced from an operational and fundamental perspective. While our occupancy rate in same store NOI have been negatively affected by the difficult leasing environment and retailer bankruptcies, we see this as an opportunity to rebuild our portfolio of tenants and change the way we lease space. We are improving the credit quality of our tenants by leasing to the current best in class retailers, agreeing to significantly less co-tenancy requests and limiting the expanse of exclusives in new lease agreements, in addition to creating more leasing synergies to careful planning for each asset. We are confident that these strategies coupled with our already solid and efficient operating platform will result to sustainable rental revenue of growth portfolio wide. We do not underestimate the economic environment we are currently operating in. We monitor our tenant watch list on a daily basis and continue to carefully evaluate the decisions to make at a property level to ensure we are in a best position for future growth. At this time, I like to turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Dan. As Scott and Bill mentioned earlier, we are making a substantial progress on the initial steps of our de-leveraging our balance sheet and improving liquidity by aggressively addressing items that are under our control. These strategies include reducing the dividend pay off for 2009, minimizing development spending to little if any in the near term, selling non-core assets, and repurchasing near term debt maturities at significant discount to par. Our top priorities currently include these initiatives, the closing of the transaction of the Otto family and raising new secured debt capital. We are also supporting numerous other capital raising activities to expand upon our current efforts, such as selling core assets into joint ventures and various corporate capital raising initiatives. Despite the challenging financing environment for buyers, asset sales are still occurring. And they are an important part of our strategy. We have sold several assets here to date for over $73 million. The sales occurred at a weighted average cap rate of 8%, and we have made considerable progress towards our expectation of $200 million of asset sales for this year. We are forecasting cap rates from this year sales to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5%. In the current environment, larger asset sales are not occurring as frequently. So we are focusing on selling single tenant assets and small shopping centers with an average transaction size in the $5 million to $25 million range. Buyers include well capitalized retailers buying back their stores, local buyers have access to capital and those who are completing 10-31 exchanges. We are seeing new buyers return to the market as cap rates have returned to their long term average after years of historic lows. We currently have $137 million of assets under contract for sale and $41 million subject to letter intent. While many deals at these stages will not be completed, we remain comfortable with our goal of $200 million of asset sales for the year. We are also working on several larger transactions, but are not counting on or budgeting those to occur. Another important initiative is re-purchasing our own secured notes at a discount to par. Throughout the first quarter, our strategy was to re-purchase in those selling at the most attractive pricing and we did so by re-purchasing over $160 million at 51% of par. We will continue to use free cash flow and new capital from sales and equity, and debt financing to repay debt. And we will be focused on our near term maturities that are trading in attractive levels. Turning now to the Otto transaction, we expect closing on this transaction to occur in the next few weeks which will be concurrent with the closing of a $125 million of new secured debt financing. The new secured debt financing will be comprised with a $40 million two year loan on a stabilized shopping center. This loan will have a floating interest rate and one year extension option, and is pre-payable at anytime. The loan value is approximately 50%. The second will be an $85 million 10 year loan on four assets located in Puerto Rico with a life insurance company. The rate with was locked 7.6% and the loan’s devalue is approximately 50%. This deal is being done with a new life insurance company relationship with DDR, and we are pleased that they are very positive about the quality of our real estate and platform. We are already working on another financing with them that we hope to advance shortly. We currently have asked patience and progress for an additional $30 million of five year loans with two different groups. In addition, the $60 million five year loan provided by the Otto family will close in the next several weeks. This loan is currently in the form a bridge loan and the proceeds received in March were used to repurchase unsecured notes at significant discount. The interest rate will decline from 10% on the bridge loan to 9% on the five-year term loan. In regard to mortgage debt maturities, we recently extended three CMBS loans that matured in the first quarter for up to an additional year. We are extending May and June maturities as well at this time. Many of our CMBS maturities in the next few years are held by the same special servicer, which at this point has been a benefit to us as we have built a good relationship with this party and have been able to come to arrangements to benefit both borrower and lender. As of March 31st, we have $103 million of debt maturing for the remainder of 2009 and $800 million maturing in 2010, excluding the $127 million of consolidated joint venture debt that relates to our partner’s share for 2010. $479 million of this 2010 debt is public unsecured notes, $288 million in CMBS, $23 million in bank debt, and 48 million is held by life insurance companies. Using a cap rate of 8.5% on the $319 million of 2010 mortgage maturities results in a loan devalue of roughly 48%. Our unconsolidated joint ventures have $300 million of debt maturing in 2009 and $1.1 billion maturing in 2010, of which our share is $69 million and $324 million respectively. Finally, I’d like to take a moment to discuss some of our joint ventures. In December, MDT announced that it was undergoing a strategic review. This strategic review is advancing and could result in asset sales or bringing in a new capital partner. Also, we’ve exercised our contractual redemption rights from the USLLC and expect to execute an asset swap with MDT that will simplify the ownership structure and enhance the flexibility for both DDR and MDT. The expected asset swap will eliminate $173 million of 2009 and $476 million of 2010 debt maturities from our unconsolidated maturity schedule. We lowered our ownership of MDT’s common stock to just below 10%, but remained the trust’s largest unit holder. Regarding our joint venture with Coventry, we remain consistent with our previous statement that we will not fund our joint venture partner’s capital contributions or their share of debt maturities. This stance led to Board Parkway Center in Kansas City being foreclosed on in February in a friendly foreclosure. We continue to manage it’s center and are working with the lender to sell the asset under an arrangement where we will receive some proceeds from the sale above the amount of debt on the property. In closing, I’d like to reiterate that our number one focus right now is reducing leverage and enhancing financial flexibility. We are working tirelessly to evaluate every option to do some and we are acting immediately on those options that are within our control. We are confident in stating that we will be able to move all of our near term debt maturities with these initiatives and look forward to emerging from this challenging part of the cycle as a stronger, more focused, and lower leveraged company. I’ll now turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Wolstein: Thanks, David. Before opening the floor to Q&A, I would like to reiterate our 2009 FFO guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per share, excluding one time items. And we expect that number to be significantly higher than that, including profits on debt repurchases. I would also like to take a moment to thank all of our colleagues here at DDR, for their efforts and for maintaining their high degree of enthusiasm during this challenging time. With that, we would like to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Shahan: Hi. Good morning. It’s Shahan [ph] here. I’m with Jay as well. Just to start with, on the Otto deal, you’ve obviously mentioned expectations of closing phase one over the next couple of weeks. Is there anything at all in your view that could possibly push the deal a lot further, beyond the expected timeline, or potentially then result in it not going through at this point?
Dan Hurwitz: No. We’ve satisfied all the conditions of closing except the closing of the two loans that we discussed. And we’ve satisfied all the conditions in the (inaudible). Now there really – barring some 9/11 event or something that we can’t even think about, there’s nothing that would stand in the way of the orderly closing of the transaction.
Scott Wolstein: Every one of those conditions has been filed either in the proxy or in the 8-K. And you can see that we have met those conditions with the closing of the two loans in the next couple of weeks.
Shahan: Okay, thanks. And then seeing to this secured side, any options there? How is the shift in tone from your discussion with life companies and banks over the past couple of weeks, obviously given that we’re seeing this window of capital open up slowly? What’s the real focus today as you try and negotiate terms and new deals here?
Scott Wolstein: We continue those having dialogues with banks and life insurance companies on an extremely regular basis, I’d say after the fourth quarter’s environment of shock about what was going on in the world, we’ve seen stabilization. Certainly not a normalization or end of a dislocation, but we continue to see a level of interest in extending new loans. Certainly not in the size of those loans that would have been extended two or three years ago but continue to see an appetite for our stable product. Clearly, at lower loan devalues than existed in prior years, but an ability to get term debts in size that is approximately at 50% loan devalue level. And so we’re showing that progress with the loan that will close in the very near term and we expect to have more capital raised on that front over the next several quarters.
Dan Hurwitz: I might echo that in addition to the progress on the debt side, there is a significant increase in activity in interest from the equity side and the private side that sort of mirrors what you’re saying in public equity, both from pension funds, opportunity funds, and individual investors. There’s far more real dialogue going on about transactions and far more inquiry coming to us than we saw in the fourth quarter.
Shahan: Thanks. And then just lastly on the 2010 to 2025 guidance for the year, what’s the same store NOI decline that year of factoring into that?
Scott Wolstein: Consistent with what we’ve guided to previously, it’s a negative 3% to 4% same store NOI.
Shahan: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Dazio with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.
Joe Dazio: Good morning. It’s Joe Dazio [ph] here with Mike. I know that you mentioned that you see occupancy kind of trending around 90% so far this year. Where do you think is the biggest risk to that number could be at this point?
Dan Hurwitz: The risk to which number? I’m sorry?
Joe Dazio: To the 90% occupancy which tenants or industry is–
Scott Wolstein: Now we have a watch list to be watched. I wouldn’t want to name tenants specifically but there’s certainly no secrets who out there as in distress, who has hired advisers, in some cases who’s hired bankruptcy counsel. We actually did expect that we would see more bankruptcy activity in the first quarter then we saw. And preliminary indications are that things generally in the market are getting a little more positive for of those retailers. Although we are not counting on it because as we’ve talked about in the past on these calls, June and July are very high risk months for retailers where their capital expenditure for fall goods is very high, but their receipts from sales is typically pretty low. So the biggest risk to that occupancy is obviously of some of those retailers who are currently hanging in there, don’t. We really won’t know that I don’t think, for the next probably 60 to 90 days.
Joe Dazio: Okay. Just a quick modeling question, how much NOI from bankrupt tenants, actually hit the first quarter numbers and that will have to come out going forward?
Dan Hurwitz: It is about – from a baseline perspective it is about $11.3 million
Scott Wolstein: The only meaningful deduct going forward that’s been announced and have shown up in operating stocks but hasn’t completely flowed through the entire first quarter was Circuit City, where the they were rent payer through the yearly portion of margin. So if you look to model out, there’s a remaining quarter. That’s the one, that would be unnoticeable number that will show up in the second quarter and beyond. Now some of those boxes will be released, but from the modeling perspective that was the one that showed up for a good portion of the quarter.
Joe Dazio: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed.
Michael Bilerman: Good morning. Clinton Valely [ph] with me here as well. David or Scott I think both of you have mentioned from the capital raising alternatives and corporate capital transactions, you just go through how you’re thinking about that? And what that relates to and what rights Otto may have, and other equity type transactions with other investors?
David Oaks: I don’t have no right to relate the equity transaction with other investors, only the fact that when they close on their equities they’ll have a couple board seats and we’ll have two votes out of twelve in terms of capital raising options of the company. We certainly expect a variety of capital raising alternatives to be completed through the balance of the year and we would expect that equity to will be one of those. We have so many other things in our place that are going to be positive before we get to that. We’d like to see a little rebound and the sure price to get some better execution. But we certainly look at that as one arrow in the quiver as you will to address our upcoming debt maturity.
Michael Bilerman: Do you think as corporate that just selling additional equity effectively following down subsequent recap type transactions.
Dan Hurwitz: I’m sorry. Can you say that again? You were breaking up a little bit.
Michael Bilerman: Sorry about that. I want to make sure I’m clear. So when you’re thinking about corporate, you’re thinking raising additional common equity not through your trip, but effectively coming out and doing a large – whether it be a well across or whether in – effectively large equity offer and probably after you do some of these other–
Dan Hurwitz: Yes, we’re not making any announcement of an equity raise on this call. But yes, certainly that’s something we’ve discussed with investment bankers and with investors. And it’s certainly an option that we will certainly consider in the months ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Can you talk a little about negotiations with your line lenders? Obviously, I believe you do have a one year extension next year on your line. But just how that process is going in terms of potentially trying to recast that early or trying to figure out some way to push that out further to take that maturity off the table.
Scott Wolstein: First of all the extension is automatic as long as we’re compliant with our loan covenants. And our projections indicate that headroom on the covenants will continue to get better and better every quarter. We don’t look at it as a 2010 maturity, as to 2011 maturity, and a 2012 maturity. We have had discussions with our line banks and what their guidance to us has been deal with your other issues first with the public debt. We’ll be there for you and they’ve indicated, while there will be certainly different pricing if we were looking a new line today and maybe less capacity that certainly that majority of banks would stay in place and we would still have a very ample credit facility going forward. As far as when is the right time to address that, certainly we’ve always done that a year out and we’ll probably have very earnest discussions about the terms of extensions in 2010.
Michael Bilerman: This is a question for Dan. You gave very good detail in terms of how some of the bankruptcies have affected occupancy or at least your lease rate which is 88.4%, I assumed as a quarter end number?
Dan. Hurwitz: That is.
Michael Bilerman: And so, relative to 92.2% at the end of the year, how much vacancy is there on the top of the 88.4% in terms of dark but rent paying anchors?
Dan Hurwitz: We have about six and – our anchors for redevelopment group has all the dark, rent paying anchors or the bankrupt boxes that we’ve received back. We have about 10.5 million feet of total in that group, 6.5 million feet as a result of bankruptcy and about 4 million feet are dark anchors that are either paying rent or have effectuated termination agreements and were back into the releasing market.
Michael Bilerman: And so that’s effectively 650 basis points?
Dan Hurwitz: Yes. That’s about right.
Michael Bilerman: And then, have you effected an economic occupancy rather than a leased rate?
Dan Hurwitz: Well, we could get that number for you Michael. I don’t have it off the top of my head but–
Michael Bilerman: I know traditionally you’d use to provide both occupancy and leased rate.
David Oaks: And the reason why it has been just a little difficult lately is because the spread is widening because of the bankruptcies. But if you recall in the past couple of years, that straight and narrowed very dramatically. And it was probably only a 50 basis point difference. Right now we are running close to 250 basis point difference. But it changes significantly by what happens with the bank of shoe boxes and the timing of when we get them back.
Michael Bilerman: And so, economic today you may be at around 85% or so and taking the chance that there’s some rent paying for taking boxes. That’s a fair way to think about it?
David Oaks: No. Including Mervyns, it’s at 88%. It’s at 88%, is our economic occupancy. Michael Bilerman – Citi I thought that was your leased rate?
David Oaks: No. That’s our economic occupancy.
Michael Bilerman: Okay.
David Oaks: It’s 88% and like I mentioned before, without the bankruptcies it’s at 94.8%. Michael Bilerman – Citi Just one last question on the committed mortgages. You talked about having an excess of $112.5 million. Does that include the $60 million secured loans from Otto? Or it excludes that?
Dan Hurwitz: No. That’s in addition to.
Michael Bilerman: In addition to. So $112 million from outside then plus another $60–
Dan Hurwitz: No. It’s $125 million from outside plus the $60 million.
Michael Bilerman: Plus the $60 million then plus the rest.
Dan Hurwitz: That’s correct.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Louis Conforte [ph] with UBS. Please proceed
Louis Conforte: Hey, folks. Just keep that cooperating fundamentals for a moment. If you were to bifurcate or breakdown big box versus SSGLA from bankruptcy standpoint, where are you losing? And can you provide a little more specific numbers. In (inaudible) question, do you think that ultimately you’re going to see continued small store deterioration and a transitive effect if the big boxes go away?
David Oakes: It’s a good question. Right now because of the influx of the bankruptcies that we have in the fourth quarter and a little bit of action in the first quarter, the bulk of our vacancy and the pressure on occupancy, if you will, as coming from the bankruptcy in the junior box to big box category, the actual small shops have held up particularly well. One of the things I mentioned is what we require small shops to give us in the event they ask for rent relief. And very often they don’t do it. They come in, they’ll ask for rent relief, they’ll ask for tax returns and then you never hear from them again. But the bulk of our occupancy that’s hit us, like I mentioned before, 44% of our total occupancy– vacancy in the portfolio is a result of really bankruptcies that have occurred in the over the last five months.
Bill Schafer: I think it’s also very important to find out– number one, that the Mervin’s bankruptcy, that’s the big part of this bankruptcy number. It’s only a 50% interest in terms of DDR’s ownership. And Secondly, DDR doesn’t own any of the shopping centers where Mervin’s is an anchor. So the Mervin’s vacancies have absolutely nothing to do with our corporate portfolio at all. And I think it’s really misleading to be talking in terms of 80% plus occupancy in our shopping centers because that’s not accurate. The occupancy is over 90% and then we have an investment in a Mervin’s portfolio along with MDT that is currently largely vacant because of the recent bankruptcy. But it has no impact at all on our shopping centers. And I think it’s really extremely misleading to talk about our shopping centers being at an 85, 88 or any certain thing close to that occupancy, it’s just not accurate.
Louis Conforte: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line James Sullivan with Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
James Sullivan: Thanks, good morning. You touched the change of control of accounting, can you shed a little bit more light on what’s happening there? And I think you specifically made a comment there are no cash payouts for current employees. But I know at least one former employee who is receiving cash payout. And I’m a little bit perplexed as to why that’s the case.
Scott Wolstein: Yes. First, let me address the first question, Jim. Many of our executives have changed the control agreement and they’re double triggered. And the first of the two triggers was triggered by the– would be triggered when we transfer 20% or more of the shares to the Otto Family. We asked all of the employees to weigh the second trigger of the dual-trigger provision, and all of the employees did that. So there is no cash payment going out to the current employees. You are correct that we have a former employer who has a severance agreement that was put in place at the time of his retirement and he was not subject to the same issues as the rest of us, and he will receive some payments.
James Sullivan: And for current employees, it was their decision not to forfeit what they would have been entitled to under change control that trigger the accounting charges? Is that right?
Scott Wolstein: Well, the way it works here, Jim, they’re entitled to nothing until the second trigger is triggered. The second trigger would be termination. So essentially, the first trigger will be triggered by the transfer of the 20% ownership of the company and then if any of those employees who had change of control agreements were terminated after that change of control, they would be entitled to significant severance benefits in excess of what would be normal without the change of control agreement. And all of the employees weighed that so none of them will benefit in any way from the change of control that related to the Otto purchase.
James Sullivan: Okay. And then another question with relates to– I think I heard you say that you were successful in extending a couple of CMBS loans for a period of one year. I’m curious what the special services are telling you in terms of what your expectation should be at the end of that one-year term? Can they continue extending those loans, or is there a day of reckoning a year out? What are you hearing from them?
Francine Glandt: Hi, this is Francine Glandt. The indications that we’ve received for the parties that we dealt with so far are that they would be willing to consider another one-year extension at the time of the next maturity should the market conditions continue as they are today.
Scott Wolstein: And I would like to add to try and (inaudible) too, Jim, that– I was at the real estate round table meeting the other day and we spent a few hours with Ben Bernanke and he’s pretty confident that we’re going to see this health [ph] program for CNBS up and running within a few weeks and very hopeful that’s going to start to create a little bit of liquidity in the CNBS market. And we’re in the cue of one of the major investment banks to do a significant health financing when that becomes available.
Operator: And at this time we have no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Wolstein for the closing remarks.
Scott Wolstein: Thank you. Once again, thanks everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in our company. Despite the difficult environment, we believe that our first quarter 2009 operating results were solid. And we continue to diligently work on a variety leveraging initiative."
7,SITC,2,2009,2009-07-24 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the second quarter 2009 Developers Diversified Realty Corporation earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host, Mr. Tom Morabito Senior Director of Investor Relations.
Tom Morabito: With me on today's call are Chairman and CEO Scott Wolstein, President and Chief Operating Officer Dan Hurwitz, Chief Financial Officer Bill Schafer, and Chief Investment Officer David Oakes.  Following our prepared remarks we will then conduct the Q&A session. Before we get started, I need to remind everyone that some of our statements today may be forward-looking in nature.  Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should assume that those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in our earnings release and in our filings with the SEC. Finally please note that on today's call we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures including FFO.  Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can also be found in the earnings release.  The release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at ddr.com. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Wolstein: To start things off I would like to thank everybody who attended our Investor Day on July 1 or listened to the webcast.  We appreciate your interest in our company and value your feedback on our disclosure.  We hope you came away with new and helpful information that shows how diligently we have worked and will continue to work to lower leverage, improve liquidity, release recently recaptured space, and ensure that we come out of this recession as a stronger company. We have already made good progress on our deleveraging initiatives and we plan to continue to aggressively raise capital in order to achieve our goals.  We ended 2008 with roughly $5.9 billion in total consolidated debt.  As of June 30, that balance has been reduced to $5.6 billion by retiring near-term maturities with retained capital, common equity and asset sale proceeds. Our current plan calls for consolidated debt to decrease to $4.8 billion by the end of 2009 and to $4.5 billion by the end of 2010.  On a consolidated debt to EBITDA basis, we forecast that we can lower this multiple to 8.3 times at year end 2009, 7.5 times at year end 2010, from 8.7 times at the year end 2008. We are accessing a wide variety of capital sources, including retain free cash flow, asset sales, new debt proceeds and new equity.  We have also continued to buy back our debt at significant discounts.  We have addressed all of our consolidated debt maturities for 2009.  With the capital that we are accessing, we are well positioned to address all of our maturities for 2010, '11 and '12. I would also like to give you an update on the new debt financing that we are pursuing as part of the government's TALF program.  David Oakes will go into more detail later on the call, but overall the transactions are proceeding well according to schedule, and our underwriters are seeing very strong answers from investors.  Importantly, the expected proceeds should address all of our remaining 2010, 2011 and [2010] mortgage maturities, and the new five-year term will fit nicely into our maturities schedule. Next, I would like to briefly discuss our second quarter operating results, which similar to last quarter, were solid despite the challenging macro environment.  While there was considerable noise from gains in non-cash charges during the quarter, some of which were occasioned by what could only be characterized as bizarre accounting rules, FFO on an operating basis for the second quarter of 2009 was $0.51 per share. Our business continues to perform relatively well and in line with expectations.  And once again we had a very strong quarter in terms of leasing with over three million square feet leased.  Given the challenges of the current environment, we were pleased with the performance of portfolio and our team. Now I'll turn it over to Bill who will go into more detail on our second quarter operating results.
Bill Schafer: As mentioned, our second quarter 2009 operating FFO was $0.51 per share and was in line with our internal projections.  After adjusting to include several non-recurring and non-operational items, FFO was a loss of $1.15 per share. Now I'll walk through some of the details regarding the specific non-operational items most of which are non-recurring and substantially all of which are non-cash.  First, we incurred a non-cash change in control charge of $10.5 million associated with the Otto transaction as it relates to certain equity award plans that immediately vested upon shareholder approval. Approximately 175 employees were impacted by this vesting.  It is important to note that this vesting was required by certain provisions in the equity award plans previously approved by the shareholders resulting from the potential 20% change in control of the company's ownership interest.  It is also important to note that the charge is calculated based on historical value at the time of award grant and not current market value, which would be a small fraction of this charge. At this time, we are projecting another $5 million non-cash charge to be incurred at the closing of the second equity tranche, which is expected to occur in late third or early fourth quarter.  We also had an $80 million non-cash charge related to the share price appreciation relative to the price at which the Otto family committed to make their investor. The accounting standards require us to treat this equity sale commitment as a derivative that requires mark-to-market accounting.  This has the ironic impact of generating greater non-cash charges as our share price appreciates.  These so-called derivatives will continue to impact reported results until the second tranche of the equity closes and the warrants are exercised.  So they have no economic impact on DDR. This treatment also impacts our balance sheet and at June 30 a $41 million non-cash liability included in other liabilities will be reclassified to equity upon ultimate exercise of the instruments.  We added a schedule to our financial supplement to provide greater transparency on these charges. Second, consolidated impairment charges for the quarter amounted to approximately $107 million.  Included in this number is approximately $61 million associated with former Mervyn's stores.  This charge was based upon adjustments to current projected rental rates and cap rates.  Our allocated share of this charge is approximately $31 million.  The remaining impairment charge relates to assets that we expect to sell in the coming months for less than book value. Third, we had actual losses on completed sales and impairments on assets held for sale aggregating $61 million, which are reflected in discontinued operations.  Fourth, we incurred additional impairment charges of $40 million associated with our share of various investments with Coventry, partially related to our partner's inability to fund cash requirements that has forced certain actions at inopportune times. Offsetting these negative non-recurring items are the net gains on debt repurchase of approximately $46 million.  In total, the impact of non-recurring gains and losses in the second quarter was approximately negative $240 million or $1.66 per share.  Even after all these non-cash charges, our book value was still approximately $14 per common share or nearly three times the recent share price. Turning now to operating results for the second quarter, same store NOI was down 5% for the quarter which is consistent with our expectations.  Our Brazil portfolio continues to perform particularly well with the same store NOI increase of over 12.5% for the quarter.  Substantially all of the decrease in consolidated base rental income in the second quarter and year-to-date is directly related to the bankruptcies of Circuit City, Goody's, Linen's 'n Things, Mervyns and Steve & Barry's. Bad debt expense for the quarter was approximately 1.5% of total revenues as compared to 1.4% in the second quarter of 2008.  G&A expenses are down approximately 16% from last year, excluding the $10.5 million non-cash charge I discussed earlier.  The reduction in G&A is attributed to compensation changes, a lower headcount, and reduction in general corporate expenses. Our ratio of G&A to revenues, exclusive of the change of control charge, has decreased only slightly to 4.2%.  This is partially related to our policy of expensing our leasing staff's salaries rather than capitalizing them, and clearly we are committing more resources to leasing today to address the bankruptcy driven vacancy that has resulted in lower revenue. Turning now to our debt convents, key takeaways include the following.  We are fully compliant with both bank facility and unsecured note covenants.  Our tightest ratio is the unencumbered asset coverage ratio in our bank facility covenants.  The value of unencumbered assets must be greater than or equal to 1.6 times consolidated unsecured indebtedness.  Our calculations indicate we are approximately 1.63 times on this ratio as of June 30th. As illustrated in our recent Investor Day presentation, we are comfortable that this ratio will trend upward each quarter going forward and we intend to operate north of 1.8 times within a year.  Factors that will improve the ratio in the second half of 2009 includes $60 million of common equity that will be issued on or before October 9th from the second tranche of the auto transaction, additional asset sale proceeds, and retained capital that will be used to repay debt.  Our unencumbered asset pool was approximately $5 billion as of June 30th and our consolidated indebtedness ratio in our bank facilities continues to improve at approximately 50% as of June 30th. Leverage and liquidity continue to be a primary focus for everyone at DDR.  As we raise capital from a variety of sources, you will see us continue to buy back our near-term maturing notes at a discount and reduce our revolver balances.  Our cash on hand and revolver capacity was over $150 million at quarter end.  We have intentionally and temporarily chosen to keep revolver balances high in favor of using funds to deal with near-term maturities at discounts to par.  As we move toward the end of 2009, we will deploy more capital to lower revolver borrowings. Finally, last week we announced the results of the second quarter 2009 dividend election.  We paid approximately $3.1 million in cash and 27.4 million in common shares, which resulted in 6.1 million additional shares outstanding at an effective price of $4.49 per share. I will now turn the call over to Dan.
Dan Hurwitz: I would like to start by providing a brief update on what we are seeing in the leasing environment as we continue to navigate ongoing economic and consumer challenges.  While we are keenly aware of the fact that many retailers are facing sales declines, the reality is that there continues to be a strong segment of retailers looking to expand their store count and capture market share from their current and fluent competitors. The short term macroeconomic headlines may suggest otherwise, but the current retail real estate environment presents a unique opportunity for retailers to aggressively seek external growth at significantly lower costs.  Over the course of the second quarter, out leasing team held many key meetings with retailers to understand revolving platforms, and as a result we leased a historic amount of GLA. Specifically, we signed 147 new leases during the quarter representing over 900,000 square feet of GLA at an average rental rate spread of negative 16.6.  Additionally, there were 259 renewal deals executed during the quarter representing over 2.1 million square feet of GLA at an average spread of positive 1%.  On a blended basis, there were 406 deals executed during the second quarter representing nearly 3.1 million square feet of GLA at an average spread of negative 4.72%.  Compared to the previous quarter, we executed 58 more leases and leased 1.2 million more square feet of GLA. I'd like to point out that of the 900,000 plus square feet of new deals signed during the second quarter, 45% represent space that was recently vacated by bankrupt retailers.  The spread on new deals signed to backfill space formerly occupied by bankrupt retailers was negative 24.2%, which is consistent with our expectations and past guidance, while the average rental rate spread on new deals, excluding those signed to backfill bankrupt retailers, was negative 9.8%. Despite the challenges of backfilling space formerly occupied by bankrupt retailers, we have seen solid improvement in the rental rates from the first quarter to the second quarter.  In the second quarter, we leased 466,000 square feet of space that was previously occupied by bankrupt retailers versus the 233,000 square feet leased in the first quarter.  And the average rent per square foot increased 63% for that space from the first quarter to the second quarter, resulting in an overall positive impact on our average base rent per square foot portfolio wide. Overall, we are very encouraged by the leasing activity that we achieved during the second quarter.  On a square foot basis, these leasing results represent the greatest level of production in the history of the company.  While the resulting rent spreads are much less favorable than what we have historically achieved, it should be no surprise that rents are under enormous pressure as vacancy continues to increase across the regional sector. From a capital expenditure perspective, the cost of executing deals has decreased 10% on a per square foot basis from the same period one year ago, as we continue to develop creative ways to utilize existing fixtures and improvements, and focus on making efficient deal with retailers.  However, given the large volume of leasing we achieved this quarter, total CapEx will be higher than we have experienced in recent periods, despite our aggressive control of capital expenditures on a per square foot basis. As evidenced by our leasing results and contrary to common perception, select retailers are in fact growing store count and increasing market share.  It should be noted that year-to-date we have leased over five million square feet of space when many were predicting the lowest deal velocity in decades.  Many of the same retailers we closed deals in the first half of the year are retailers that we continue to do business with. The most active retailers include Bed, Bath and Beyond and its various concepts, Best Buy, hhgregg, Hobby Lobby, JoAnn stores, Nordstrom Rack, Dollar Tree, AC Moore and regional grocers, such as Sprouts.  Also very active are Staples, Michaels, and the TJX companies, the parent company for T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright and HomeGoods.  We have multiple executed leases or inactive lease or LOI negotiations with each of the retailers that I just mentioned. I would also like to highlight the fact that two of our largest tenants, Wal-Mart and TJX, recently announced significant long-term debt refinancing transactions.  The low cost of capital of many of our largest tenants is likely to encourage and fund their future growth. As I discussed on our previous call and on Investor Day, we've been very active in the tenant community with formal face-to-face meetings to discuss the temporary shifts in operating platforms for many of our tenants.  The feedback we are receiving from the tenant community suggests that retailers are consistently reevaluating who they do business with, and DDR remains prominent as a trusted and desired business partner who will deliver high quality space with certainty of execution. Despite strong leasing results and tenant feedback, we are still experiencing the effects of the retail bankruptcies that occurred in late 2008 and early 2009, as well as the general retail fallout that continues to trickle through the system.  Our portfolio lease rate, as of the end of the second quarter, was 90.7%.  Historically, within our portfolio, the lease rate has trended down from first quarter to second quarter. However, we were able to hold our lease rate flat as a result of strong leasing results from prior quarters.  As such and similar to what we have discussed in previous calls, we view this as further evidence that we are operating at trough occupancy barring any significant additional downturn in the economy and anticipate modest occupancy improvement in Q3 and Q4. Addressing the big box vacancies, our anchor store redevelopment ream continues to diligently backfill the approximately seven million square feet of junior and anchor space that has been recently returned to us through the bankruptcy process.  As mentioned at our Investor Day conference, we have made significant progress and currently have half of the units either sold, leased, at lease, or under LOI.  We continue to work creatively to re-tenant these spaces with strong credit tenants and maximize the reuse of existing improvements to minimize capital outlays for tenant allowance. Moreover, we are pleased with the deal flow that consistently replenishes the LOI category as the previous LOI's move to lease and then execution.  To give you some perspective on velocity, since the first quarter our anchor store redevelopment ream has leased an additional 16 units, which includes five executed leases even since Investor Day.  In addition to the inherent upside potential of permanent leasing within our anchor store redevelopment portfolio, it should be noted that our new business development team continues to generate significant revenue through temporary and seasonal leasing of vacant big boxes. Our new business development initiative has proved to be a vital aspect of our overall operating platform and an effective hedge against lost rental revenues as a result of increased vacancy.  To date, our new business development department has generated $3 million of revenue committed from temporary tenants within our anchor store redevelopment portfolio, and total revenues within that department have increased 20% from the same time period in 2008. Turning for a moment to our overall portfolio, our management team has actively discussed our corporate strategy from a portfolio perspective over the past several months.  As we navigate through the current economic cycle and our portfolio continues to face headwinds, there is an underlying opportunity to restructure our portfolio and re-tenant our assets. Through active asset management, we have begun to build a best-in-class portfolio that is diversified by asset type, geography and tenant base.  The opportunity to re-tenant our portfolio comes from the recent fallout of weaker retailers and provides us with the unprecedented opportunity to focus on today's best-in-class retailers that will add value to our centers and lower the overall risk profile.  As you can see from this quarter's leasing results, this transformation is occurring daily. As we consider various asset sales, we must determine which assets we want to keep in the franchise and which assts we are willing to even dispose of if motivated.  Given the underlying opportunities that the current environment creates, we are thrilled to review the existing portfolio to create a list of prime assets.  Our prime assets are those which we will not sell to third parties, but rather will be held as long-term franchise properties. The excluded assets and single-tenant properties are those which we will continue to consider for outright sale with a goal toward enhancing our liquidity, strengthening the balance sheet and increasing the long-term growth profile.  It should be noted the prime portfolio occupancy rate currently stands at 93%. I would now like to take a brief moment to address rent relief and co-tenancy as these continue to be issues in topics of discussion both among retailers and investors.  In terms of rent relief, we continue to receive requests, albeit at a much slower rate, from tenants seeking concessions, abatements and deferrals.  We do not foresee those requests going away any time soon.  We do, however, expect the impact from rent concessions to be far less than the market may perceive and our statistics indicate just that. To date, we have granted less than 4% of the requests we have received.  The average concession granted is a 23% reduction in rent usually in the form of a deferral for one year, after which the tenant reverts back to paying the base rent agreed to in their executed lease agreement and generally we pay any deferred amount in future years. Turning to co-tenancy, I'd like to clarify the impact it has had on our portfolio.  At Investor Day we indicated that only 1% of our tenants are paying rent subject to a co-tenancy provision and this is still the case.  While many of the tenants in our portfolio have lease language that includes co-tenancy relief, alternative rent driven by a co-tenancy violation must be triggered by an event and, therefore, the impact is current very limited.  The risk of additional triggers occurring in the future is not imminent but certainly possible and we continue to monitor the situation diligently. Regarding our investments in Brazil, I would now like to take a brief moment to discuss the macroeconomic climate and provide an update on portfolio operations.  Brazil retail sales rose more than expected in May indicating that consumer demand is driving a rebound in Latin America's largest economy.  Sales rose 7.1% in April and 4% in May over the same period one year earlier.  The Brazil Central Bank recently reduced the current short-term interest rate from 9.25% to 8.75%, which is a record low. The Bovespa Exchange is up 31.8% year-to-date and the Brazil Central Bank projects 2009 GDP to grow by 1%.  The forecast for inflation remains modest at 4.1%.  As of May 31, our Brazilian portfolio remains 97.1% occupied and same store NOI growth for the second quarter was 12.5%.  In April we opened a new shopping center in Manaus, well over 90% leased as retailers continue to look for expansion opportunities. In addition to solid operating fundamentals, we together with our partner, closed on significant financing transactions that will enhance liquidity for our partnership.  We closed on two loans totaling 95 million in reais and sold limited interest in one of our shopping centers to raise additional capital.  We continue to be very pleased with our investments in Brazil and foresee the portfolio to be an imperative driver of our growth over the next several years. In summary, we have made significant leasing progress and continue to creatively re-tenant our portfolio.  However, we do not discount the environment we are currently operating in.  Deals are tough, retailers and landlords alike are under enormous pressure and the consumer continues to lack confidence causing them to trade down, which ultimately provides a benefit for many of our discount tenants. As we make our way through the remaining summer months when retail sales are at their seasonal trough and cash [outline] is at its peak, we will continue to monitor our watch list, meet with key retailers and stay apprised of industry-wide issues that may potentially cause systemic risks and disrupt retail operations. That being said, we are pleased that June and July, thus far, have not seen any additional material bankruptcies for our portfolio.  Overall, based on what we've seen over the past 12 months and even though we have taken a clear and early occupancy hit to our portfolio, our tenant base is rebounding and our operating platform continues to perform at a very high level. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: At our Investor Day we laid out what we had accomplished thus far regarding our leverage and liquidity build and what we expected to accomplish in the near-term.  I am pleased to report that we have made progress on various deleveraging initiatives during the three weeks since then, which I will take a moment to update you on. We've sold four assets since July 1, bringing our total asset sales for 2009 to over $225 million of which our share is $179 million.  We fully expect to continue to execute on asset sales throughout 2009 and currently have an additional $320 million of assets under contract for sale or subject to letter of intent over half of which have non-refundable deposits. Several of these sales are generating accounting losses, but we firmly believe that selling these non-prime assets is the appropriate strategy, especially considering the attractive returns associated with reinvesting that capital.  We also firmly believe that our historic accounting cost basis should not be a driver or deterrent to transactional activity.  We continue to make progress on several new debt capital transactions. This week we closed $17 million of new long-term capital.  This 8.5 year 6% loan with a life insurance company brings our total new debt capital raise to over $200 million year-to-date.  We continue to work through due diligence with a lender for a $125 million five-year mortgage on an asset in Puerto Rico and anticipate closing in the late third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. We are also making good progress on our TALF eligible CMBS financing and due diligence is progressing as expected.  We anticipate the first closing to occur in the fall and the expected proceeds will be used to continue to address our near-term maturities.  In some cases we will be repaying existing mortgages with near-term maturities and replacing them with longer duration debt, and in other cases the new proceeds will be used to repay unsecured debt potentially at a discount to par. We repurchased a very modest amount of our senior unsecured notes since our July 1 Investor Day due to the earnings blackout period, but we expect to continue to do so as a means to delever once this period expires.  Total repurchases are now over $380 million of face value of debt year-to-date at a weighted average 65% of par and a 26% average yields maturity.  Our focus will continue to be retiring near-term maturities that are trading at attractive levels using cash flow from operations, proceeds from asset sales and new debt and equity capital. Next, I'd like to update you on our 2009 debt maturities schedule.  Of the $360 million of consolidated debt on January 1, 2009 that was set to mature this year, we have paid off $287 million and have addressed either by extension or refinancing $73 million.  We are now focused on 2010 maturities and beyond.  Today, the company's share of unconsolidated debt maturing in 2009 is $47 million.  Of that amount, all is in the process of being extended or refinanced. In addition to our immediate maturities since January 1, 2009, we have also repaid over $80 million of consolidated 2010 maturities and over $150 million of consolidated 2011 maturities.  While our revolver balances increased roughly $150 million between January 1 and June 30 of this year, we have retired approximately $675 million of debt that was scheduled to mature by mid 2012. Lastly, I'd like to clarify a few things regarding the MDT joint venture.  We announced two weeks ago that we had entered into a binding commitment with MDT to redeem our interest in the DDR McCrory Fund.  I want to point out that we are redeeming 14.5% of the equity value, not the asset value.  The goal of this transaction was to simplify the structure and improve flexibility for both parties, as well as to lower our leverage, which is why we agreed to receive just three assets with relatively low loan to values.  We expect closing on the redemption in the fall of this year and we will continue to receive deeds for actively leasing and managing all of the MDT assets. I'll now turn the call back over to Scott.
Scott Wolstein: As you've heard, we have certainly come a long way in a very short period of time.  A great deal of work remains and we are committed to executing on the plan that we have outlined for you.  As we continue to focus on our prime portfolio properties and to align ourselves with the best strategic partners in the industry to operate with lower leverage, I firmly believe that we will continue to enhance our leadership position in this sector. Broadly speaking, the business continues to perform well and in line with our expectations and certainly better than what is generally perceived by the market.  We continue to project that occupancy will improve throughout the year following its trough last quarter, and we project that same store NOI for the year will decline approximately 4%. In terms of guidance, we are lowering our 2009 operating FFO per share expectations to a range of $2 to $2.15 per share from $2.10 to $2.25 largely based on the following factors.  Number one, loss NOI due to higher asset sales volume, two, lower projected land sale gains, three, higher interest expense due to wider spread primarily related to rating agency credit downgrades, four, lower share prices have projected on the issuance of shares related to our stock dividends, five and finally, modestly more conservative functions regarding development leasing and consolidated NOI for the balance of the year. While our new guidance provides a lower range than that provided on our fourth quarter call, it does reflect a much more conservative assumption and a far less leveraged capital structure. With that, we will open up the line and take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Jay Haberman – Goldman Sachs.
Jay Haberman: I'm here with [Johan] as well.  I guess, Scott, just to start, could you comment a bit just broadly on what you think implications of CIT might be for the industry and have you made any sort of factoring in there in terms of guidance?  And as well, can you comment specifically where you expect Sam's Store to trend in the latter half of the year?
Scott Wolstein: I'll comment very briefly on CIT, but I think Dan Hurwitz is probably closer to that situation.  Clearly CIT is a major lender to the retail industry, but not a major lender to the big box national tenants that comprise the majority of our revenue.  I would expect that if CIT cease to be a factor in the industry it would have an effect on retail generally, but I would expect the impact would be probably greater in the malls and neighborhoods centers than it would be in the large community centers.  But I'll turn to Dan to elaborate on that.
Dan Hurwitz: Well, Jay, the CIT issue is one we follow pretty carefully because it concerns us.  It's another negative headline for retail for sure.  There's 300,000 retailers that currently have some financing relationship with CIT.  Some of our bankrupt tenants, particularly Circuit City, had a long relationship with CIT.  Our biggest concern, obviously, would be if the lack of funding from CIT interfered with inventory that would be coming in within the next two months for the holiday season, it could have systemic effect to retail. And we've been working with ICSC, we've been working with NRF and we've been talking to a number of retailers to try to get the risk that we perceive across to, not just government officials, but others within the sector who could have an impact on the outcome of this.  There's nothing positive that can happen for our sector for the CIT going away and we're watching it pretty closely.  They are a huge supplier of capital for, not just retailers, but also for vendors.  And if the supply chain of inventory gets interrupted at the holiday season that could have a material negative impact on the sector.
Jay Haberman: And just switching gears for a moment, could you walk through I guess the bid as spreads on asset sales.  I mean it seems, as cap rates seem to be moving above 9%, are you seeing a lot more interest on the part of buyers?
Scott Wolstein: There's been a little bit of an increase in cap rates in terms of our pipeline.  Most of it's been related to the quality of assets that we're selling.  Obviously, the lower the quality, the higher the cap rate and we've been highly focused on selling the assets that we don't want to own. But the assets have reasonably good quality that may not make the cut for our prime portfolio that are under contract and we're negotiating.  We're still trading in the mid-eights to the low nine kind of cap rate range.  So I think that there hasn't been a really significant change. And I also think, obviously, there is a big print on the trade for McCrory Countrywide to CalFirst and First Washington.  I think it's a little dangerous for people to extrapolate from a transaction of nearly $1 billion in size as to what it means for cap rates on individual asset sales. In a transaction of that magnitude, as you can image, there's very limited competition and it's a much more difficult negotiation.  On the one-off deals, it's a very, very different landscape in terms of leverage.  And you shouldn't expect to see any significant difference in terms of future asset sales here on a cap rate basis from what we've been able to achieve earlier this year.
Jay Haberman: And can you give us a sense, you mentioned obviously, the deleveraging you mentioned year end in your target.  Can you give us some specifics, I guess, on timing and is that going to be much more focused toward year end, and I guess a big part of that is the equity that you're targeting.  So I guess just help us think about timing as you delever over the next 12 to 24 months.
Scott Wolstein: Well, the delevering is going to come really from two sources, Jay.  I mean the immediate source of delevering is going to come from continued discounts on the repurchase of indebtedness.  We've been out of the market during a blackout period, we'll probably be back in the market soon, and that delevering will continue unabated from that source.  And then the balance, as you correctly pointed out, would be from equity issuance and asset sales and those I would expect would occur late third quarter, early fourth quarter.
Jay Haberman: Question for Bill, term fees seem to be trending below the prior year.  Is that really just due to the higher level of bankruptcies this year?  I'm just wondering why term fees aren't trending higher given the amount of store closings.
Bill Schafer: Termination fees are dependent upon each individual situation.  To be honest with you, this quarter's numbers are pretty much in line with our expectations.
Scott Wolstein: A lot of the termination fees we've generated in the past have been termination fees paid by Wal-Mart, in connection with their transitioning out of discount stores into super centers.  We've done large packages of terminations with Wal-Mart in the past, and our stable of Wal-Mart centers hasn't grown, yet the conversions have progressed pretty dramatically so there's less of those types of situations in the portfolio.  And you may see a decline in termination fees from that particular source, which has really been probably half of the termination fees we've generated in the past.
Jay Haberman: And [Johan] has a question as well.
[Johan]: I'm just wondering if you could remind us of the revised same store NOI outlook for the year, and then maybe just how you see that trending specifically over the next two quarters.
Bill Schafer: The original guidance on same store NOI was that it would be down 3% to 4%.  For the year at this point obviously through half the year and with good visibility on the second half of the year, I think we're now circling the lower end of that range and looking at a down 4% same store NOI, on a quarterly basis it will vary. This quarter was a very tough comp, as you think about second quarter of last year before the most meaningful changes in the economic and retailer environment and bankruptcy environment, and so it was a lower number than that range this quarter.  But for the year, our guidance is for around 4% decline in same store NOI.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Scott, at the conclusion of the Analyst Day you had stated, I think, that this was the management team that you were looking to working with moving forward, but I think you kind of hinted there might be some changes in the future.  Any sense what those changes might be that you can highlight for us?
Scott Wolstein: I think that's something we'll be happy to talk about if and when it happens.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And I guess, maybe, how is the board thinking about leadership and more, if I can ask, alignment because whether or not you have near-term success on your restructuring plan, it is difficult I think for some investors to get comfortable with allocating capital to DDR when the management team that got us here, as you said, is still at the helm and the equity held by insiders is now relatively small.  I guess I'm wondering how does the board try and realign interests here.  Do you think they grant out of the money options to board members or can the Otto family members take a more active role without triggering different tax treatments?
Scott Wolstein: I'm not sure I understand the question, although, I'll try to answer it anyway.  With respect to the Otto family, they are very active investors in terms of their participation in the boardroom and it's something that I think is welcomed both by management and by the balance of the board.  They are, obviously, very significantly invested both in terms of capital and reputation into the future performance of the company. And the Otto family's investment in our company was made because of their knowledge and confidence in the existing management team, and they are highly interested in making sure that that team stays in place and that compensation plans are put in place that provide the motivations that align their interests with their interest as an investor. With respect to the balance of the board, again, I think the board, like every board of a company that has seen their company punished by radical changes in the environment of the capital markets, is disappointed by that.  But I think they recognize largely these decisions that were made on the capital side were made collectively by management and the board under the circumstances, and they're confident that we have a team in place that can operate effectively in the new world. I do think that there will be efforts made to more properly align management with the shareholders in terms of compensation schemes, and I think that's something that probably is going on in every boardroom in the country and DDR is no exception.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And that's really at the heart of my question, I guess, that I was asking.  I think on the one hand there are some shareholders who were disgruntled that there hasn't been some sort of change either at the management or the board level, frankly, but at the other hand you want to be sure that the team that is in place is properly aligned.  Do you have a sense of whether or not that alignment comes in the form of shares of is it out of the money options or is that all to be determined?
Scott Wolstein: Again, Jeff, I don't want to be short here, but I think that's the kind of stuff that will be disclosed when it's done, and there are discussions that are very active at the board level to put that in place.  I don't think you'll have to wait very long to learn the conclusions of those discussions.  And I think, when you do, you'll be very pleased that it was a very thoughtful effort to make sure that some of the traditional metrics that were put in place before are replaced with those that properly align management and shareholders interests.
Operator: Your next question comes from Quentin Velleley - Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: I'm here with Michael Bilerman.  Thank you for giving us the updated guidance number.  It sounds like the likelihood of further impairments, write-downs and the impact of the auto derivative, I guess you could call it, will be high certainly for the remainder of this year.  Can you give us some kind of indication on what you're expecting for impairments and such for the rest of this year?
Scott Wolstein: Quentin, that's a question that's impossible to answer because if we expected any further impairments we would have taken them.  To do it right, and I'm not sure every company does it right, you have to look at the situation every quarter and if there is any impairment that you expect, you need to take it in that quarter.  You don't have the option of deferring things into the future. So as we sit here the only answer to that question is we expect no further impairment because if we did expect them, we would have taken them.  The only thing we can say is that if the shares price continues to rise, the impairment on the auto equity will continue to rise.  I think it is a somewhat ridiculous accounting treatment of that transaction, since the equity was actually issued at a significant premium at the time, but the fact that there is a delayed settlement causes the account to be treated as a derivative trade, which wasn't the way either of us looked at it. The warrants, obviously, have a five-year term and to the extent that the share price appreciates the warrants will also occasion impairments on that transaction.  But with respect to other things, in terms of assets held for sale, in terms of joint ventures, in terms of all of those things, if we expected further impairments, we would take them.  And I think that we've been fairly aggressive in that regard and I think probably with a view towards being completely compliant with the most conservative accounting rules.
David Oakes: As Scott indicated, as we enter into potential sale transactions and items along those lines, we have to evaluate the assets that would be considered for sale and we have done that with regard to everything to date so.
Quentin Velleley: And on the junior anchor releasing its right to see some progress there, I'm keen to hear your thoughts and views on what's happening in some of the in-line or the shop space around the junior anchors that are remaining vacant.  How are the tenants traveling?  Are you seeing a decrease in occupancy in that space, are tenants asking for addition rent relief and so forth?
Dan Hurwitz: Generally speaking, within the portfolio, if you take out the bankruptcies, our occupancy is consistent with prior years it's around 95%, so the non-bankrupt portfolio is actually operating pretty well.  What I think we could say, as a generalization, is because we do have exposure to virtually every type of retail within our portfolio, the greatest distress, if you will, among small shops is in the grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping center portfolio, which is primarily a joint venture with a co-mingled fund.  That portfolio is where we see the most delinquencies and the most distress among small shops. In the large community centers, power centers and certainly in our Puerto Rico and Brazil malls, we're seeing far less of that, and most of the small shops in our large community centers are national tenants.  You'll see many more local tenants in the neighborhood grocery-anchored centers.  And if we were to generalize anything with respect to our portfolio, by far, that's where we see the greatest amount of distress and delinquencies.
Quentin Velleley: I'm keen for an update on the 60 odd acres of land that you've got in Russia.  Are you trying to divest that land at the moment?  Just remind us whether or not the Otto family had any involvement in that JV.
Scott Wolstein: Yes, I mean we are partners with ECE, which is a development company owned by the Otto family and we're a 75%-25% partnership in the Russian venture and it's managed by ECE, they're the operating partner. Where that venture stands currently is that we own two fully entitled, fully permitted development sites in two cities in Russia.  We mothballed both projects until we either defined a third party investor or lender that wants to fund the development of those projects or until we find somebody who wants to buy the land. We're not going to export any further capital at this point from the United States over to Russia.  The situation over there is not one that is receptive to new development at the present time.  But the investment we've made there we think is a sound investment in long-term and we think we will recover whatever investment we made to date and then some.
Quentin Velleley: Were there any changes to your joint venture with the Otto's or with ECE in relation to anything outside the U.S.?  Were there any buyouts or capital calls or anything that may have changed along with them investing in the U.S.?
Scott Wolstein: No, no changes at all.
Quentin Velleley: And then just getting back to compensation, as you look forward and I think you talked about the incentives in the prior programs sort of leading to where you are today.  Clearly compensation for the company was at the upper end of the REIT universe.  And I'm just trying to figure out if the incentives now are going to be aligned towards what would probably be deleveraging.  Isn't that sort of getting comp on the way up for getting the company too highly leveraged and then getting comp on the way down for fixing up what happened before?
Scott Wolstein: Well first of all I don't agree with your premise that the company was one of the highest compensated in the group.  I think the schedules that we've seen are flawed in that they only look at the consolidated income of the company in terms of valuing how comp relates to overall revenues. Almost half, or even or half of the company that we run is run on behalf of third party investors who pay fees to the company for those services.  And if you take the EBITDA from the joint ventures, combine it with EBITDA for the wholly-owned portfolio I think we're actually one of the lower compensated companies as a percentage of EBITDA. Having said that, we think that the compensation scheme that rewards employees for FFO growth without regards to the balance sheet metrics is inappropriate and has led many companies into positions that they don't want to be in.  And we're no exception from that and the new compensation schemes that are being discussed would not do that. There would be a variety of metrics that would be tied to the immediate objectives of the company in terms of deleveraging, terming out debt maturities and generating income at the top line but not at the bottom line.  So we'd be much more focused on EBITDA than we would on FFO, if you will. Also, I would expect that any new compensation schemes here will be highly tied to shareholder performance.  And if the shareholders do well I expect management will participate in that.  I think those are the philosophies that the board has espoused in their discussions, and I think that's what will find its way into any future schemes.
Quentin Velleley: In terms of performance, that would be an absolute and a relative or just an absolute measure in terms of shareholder performance?
Scott Wolstein: Absolute and relative.
Quentin Velleley: And then, Scott, I think at Investor Day you did mention that your role could potentially change, that you're clearly going to be in the company but potentially your role, or your title, at some point.  And I just didn't know if that was near-term or that is something you're thinking about down the road?
Scott Wolstein: Well, first of all I didn't say that.  I said that the team that is in place will continue to be the team that's in place and some roles and titles may change.  I didn't make any specific reference to mine.  And I really don't want to discuss this anymore.  I think if and when something is done in that regard, we'll be happy to discuss it with you.  I really don't think this is an appropriate line of questioning.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Harris – Arroyo Capital.
David Harris: I've got two quick questions for Dan if I may.  With regard to rents, Dan, I believe you used the words tremendous pressure.  Could you give us an idea of where you think how much pressure onto the downside we're going to see across the board on rents and a given timeframe around that, too?
Dan Hurwitz: Well, I think right now, David, what we're seeing is even in the non-bankrupt portfolio where we're executing new leases on vacant space where we had a prior tenant, we're seeing pressure around the 10% range on the rental rates, and that's a significant number.  Any time we hit the double digits we're concerned with that. As I mentioned in the script, the rental pressure on back-filling bankrupt boxes is about 24%.  So the bankrupt boxes are putting on even more extreme pressure, but overall if you just look at the non-bankrupt portfolios we're still filling about 10%.  We don't think that's going to end any time soon.  I think right now what you're seeing is tenants that are using this opportunity in this environment to expand market share at a good price. I think if you think of ourselves as a consumer and you look at what's happening no one is buying anything at full price today.  You shouldn't if you don't have to, and right now tenants are the same.  Really they're looking at it like space is for sale for some extent, no different than you and I as consumers aren't paying full price for anything that we're buying. And I think that will continue until number one, sales go up to the point where they can fund their growth expectations through and they need to fund their growth expectations with external acquisitions, or in fact we have more competition for space because right now that's what drives rent is competition for space and that is somewhat limited.  There are tenants that want space, but we don't have two and three people bidding for that space and that puts us at a lower leverage position.
David Oakes: I think it's important to note that just the credibility that Dan and we have with answering that because this is not a situation where we're speculating where rents are.  This leasing team generated a record level of leasing transactions this quarter.  So this is not our best guess as to where this market is. This is nearly a million square feet of new leases executed, three million square feet of total leasing executed.  So I really do think we're speaking to, not where what we think might happen or where this will fall out, I mean we're doing a huge volume of leasing today.  And so this is real time in terms of where deals are actually getting done, not where we hope to get them done.
David Harris: So let me just clarify that, the 10% reference is that 10% down from here the leases that you were most recently signing, or is that 10% reflective of what you just signed?
Dan Hurwitz: No, that's 10% over the prior rent on leases we're just signing.
David Harris: So would you hazard a guess as to how much further we've got to go from here?
Dan Hurwitz: I think that's a good number to be honest with you.  Again as David said, the sample is huge.  Right now if you look where we are right now from January, we're over 5.2 million feet of transactions.  So we have a good feel for where we are in renewals.  We have a good feel on where we are for new deals and I think we have a good feel for where we are on the bankrupt space. The one thing I would mention however though where we saw a sharp increase in rental rate is in the bankrupt space where we're 63% above the rate that we had in first quarter, in the second quarter.  And some of that had to do with the nature of the tenants that we we're doing business with and the structure of the deals, but most of it has to do with I think with the quality of the real estate. So I think our guess is that we're going to be and our strong feeling is that we're going to be in that 20% to 30% range to back-fill the bankrupt tenants, and I think the portfolio will be probably in the high single digits to low double digits overall.
Scott Wolstein: There's one other thing, David, that I'd like to point out that often gets overlooked.  The tenants are really not concerned about the rent number they're concerned about the overall occupancy cost number.  And we're working very, very hard to reduce the non-rent component of occupancy cost within the portfolio.  And our operations team has done a phenomenal job of reducing CAM, appealing taxes. Real estate taxes are going to come down across the country as we see property values decline.  That's going to reduce tenants' occupancy cost on the tax side.  And whatever we can do on the expense side in terms of other occupancy costs ultimately will be reflected in higher base rent.  So it's a much more complicated equation just looking at is rent going to be $8 or $10, it really is what's rent is a percentage of occupancy, what's occupancy cost is a percentage of sales, and what can we do to reduce other occupancy cost to enable us to get more rent. And that takes little bit of time to resonate, but in times like this people look for every opportunity to save money within the operations of these projects, in terms of energy conservation, in terms of our [bumbling] initiative, in terms of buying better and buying more efficiently, and again in terms of tax appeal.  So while this is a near-term deflation, if you will, in terms of rent because of the bankruptcies, I think that some of the initiatives we've instituted during this recession are going to bear fruit in terms of higher rent in the future because we will have reduced other occupancy costs.
David Harris: Okay and then just very quickly, on Brazil you mentioned two loans, is that secured debt in bank finance?  Could you just give a little elaboration on the nature of the lending market in Brazil, Dan?
David Oakes: It's two new small loans secured by our portfolio down there that have just helped to generate additional near-term liquidity down there where we have very little debt down there today and so it's just as that market continues to evolve, showing that we can generate some additional liquidity at the local level.
David Harris: Any idea on pricing, David?
David Oakes: I'm sorry?
David Harris: Could you give an idea of pricing?
David Oakes: Pricing on those loans is high relative to U.S. standards because the risk free rates, [inaudible] rate is so much higher, so all in you end up in the low to mid teens.
Scott Wolstein: Keep in mind we're borrowing in reais so it's all relative.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors.
Nick Vedder for James Sullivan: It's Nick Vedder here.  Just a broader question on financing, as you and some of your reais peers start to look at TALF as a means of financing, can you comment on the availability of secured debt from traditional sources today, and has that changed over the past few months?
Scott Wolstein: Jim, a lot of the secured debt availability relates to the calendar, insurance companies get their allocations every year.  So you have most capacity in the beginning of the year and then it starts to decline as you get later in the year, then it picks up again as you get closer to the next year.  So I'd say right now there's probably less dialogue with life companies than there was six months ago and there will be more dialogue as we get into the year, later in the year. Having said that, what we have seen is a lot more activity from commercial banks who felt like they were being crowded out of the market by the life companies.  And a lot of the activity that we're having is actually not from life companies but from banks.  And particularly in the Puerto Rico portfolio we've had significant amount of interest from commercial banks to do secured lending. So I think it's, again, there's not a deep market out there to tap into, although we do see that there's a tremendous appetite on this TALF financing because it's a different investors that's IRR driven and they're talking about really double-digit IRR returns.  And there's very significant appetite from that investment community and their funds being raised every day to really tap into those opportunities.
Nick Vedder for James Sullivan: And specifically with TALF, does DDR have the ability to put [meds] financing on top of the first mortgages on the TALF properties?
Scott Wolstein: Well we do, but we probably won't do it because we have a facility in place with a consortium of banks that enables us to pledge second lien on low leveraged assets.  And we'll probably use the low leveraged assets that are financed by the TALF to further collateralize that facility. But, yes, there is an opportunity in the TALF structure to basically take your loan to value up as high as formally traditional levels of 60%, 65%.  But, again, it comes at a fairly high price because the IRR that the investor is looking to achieve will not go down as they go higher on the loan to value, but now they're getting their IRR, you have to get it on their money not on the Fed's money. So the blended rate would go up from something in the high fours to low fives to take something in the 7% or even 8% range.  And we don't really need to tap into that kind of marginal 12% to 15% IRR money because we do have this facility in place with a consortium of banks that gives us essentially the same benefit without the incremental cost.
David Oakes: Nick, it's really a distinction between liquidity and leverage.  And I think you've seen us make progress thus far through the year and with the plans we've outlined for the rest of the year considerably on the liquidity front and still making some progress on the leverage front.  The notion of adding additional debt to reasonably levered assets whether they're existing or newly levered assets certainly helps liquidity. But at this point, we believe our plans have outlined more than enough liquidity for the near-term.  The focus longer term is the reduction in leverage.  And so the marginal benefit from adding incremental leverage to assets just isn't as great as we look forward as it has been over the past year, as we've been focused very much on ensuring as strong liquidity position.
Nick Vedder for James Sullivan: In terms of the operating front, Dan you mentioned that 45% of the new leasing activity was for space that was previously occupied by bankrupt retailers.  I'm just curious how much space the new retailers are taking in those boxes relative to the total size of the dark space and the TIs associated with the releasing.
Dan Hurwitz: The vast majority of them are taking the full box.  We have a few situations where you may have some square footage on the back of the box or you may have a carve-out in the front for a smaller store where you reduce frontage.  But the vast majority of the deals we've done thus far in that portfolio has either been for the entire box with a single user or split for two users.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller – JP Morgan.
Joe Desio for Michael Mueller: Joe Desio here, a question on the guidance, one of the things you mentioned driving the decline was the lower assumed land sale gains.  Can you just remind us how much land sale gains were embedded in both the old and the new range?
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Of each one of the factors, we outlined in the $0.10 change represented $0.01 to $0.02 of the change and so you're talking about roughly $2 million difference in prior budgeted land sales versus currently budgeted land sale gains.
Joe Desio for Michael Mueller: Did you guys previously give any indication what the prior budget land sale gain was?
Scott Wolstein: We didn't break that out, no.
Joe Desio: Then just a question for Dan, wondering if you can give an early read on how Q3 leasing volumes so far are shaping up relative to the, I guess it was really strong in the second quarter?
Dan Hurwitz: Third quarter leasing is going well.  The bulk of the activity that we're seeing, again, is in our anchor store group.  Obviously, that's where we have the bulk of our vacancies, so that's where the bulk of the activity should be.  But what our concern was to be honest was, as we brought a lot of deals to closure in the second quarter, that the Q would have dropped off significantly for the third quarter and that's something that we've been looking at and watching very carefully.  That has not been the case. We've been very pleased with the fact that, as we have rolled deals from LOI to executed lease, the Q in the LOI categories continued to stay robust and ultimately we'll convert the vast majority of those LOIs to leases.  So originally we had projected that we would do about eight million feet of leasing for the entire year, and right now we're on a path to do a little better than that.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: Where do you all expect to see occupancy at December 31st?
Dan Hurwitz: We think that occupancy will go up, as I mentioned, nominally in the second quarter and again – I mean in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter.  So at the very high end, we think we can end the year at about 50 basis point plus in occupancy from where we are today, and on the low end somewhere in the 20 to 30 basis point movement.
Carol Kemple: And have you all issued any stock for your continuous equity program so far this year?
David Oakes: We have not.
Carol Kemple: Do you expect any further changes to the dividend in 2009?
Scott Wolstein: That's something we discuss at the board level and it'll be discussed at the next meeting, which is September 9th.  So at this point, it's really not our call and don't know yet.
David Oakes: [Inaudible] articulated represents paying the minimum amount required to maintain REIT status per our recent dividend declarations.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore: How leased are the new developments and the redevelopments that you're working on?
Dan Hurwitz: The new developments are currently 82.4% leased, and our redevelopment projects are in the 70s about 74% to 76% leased, depending on which project we're talking about.
Richard Moore: And how's that going, Dan?  Is that improving over the first quarter?
Dan Hurwitz: You know, it's slow.  There's not a lot of great enthusiasm out there right now for some of these projects.  But it's going to be hard to get them from 84 to 90, for example that's going to be the tough battle.  But we are seeing progress, but its slow progress and we'll have to just keep banging away.
Richard Moore: And then on the TALF program, is that sort of out of your guys' hands at this moment, like it's moving along with the government or investors, or is that something you can actively push from your end?
Scott Wolstein: Well, you know, there's a process that you have to go through, Rich, and we are going through the steps of the process.  You know, the initial step is you meet with the Fed, that's been done.  Second step is you start to do the third party reports, which are being done.  Third step is you meet with the rating agencies, which is being done or has been done.  And then once you get your proceeds level at AAA from the rating agencies, you go back to the Fed and get them to signoff, then you go and market to investors. We had a lot to say about the process and we are very actively engaged in it with the underwriters, but those steps must be taken and they get taken at their own pace with each step along the way, because our particular TALF financing has been so widely discussed in the public, we've kind of skipped ahead a step in that the investors are aware of it.  And the investors have been calling the underwriters expressing interest in investing in the paper before we've actually been able to expose the rated securities to the marketplace. So you'd probably have a little better feel for the ultimate outcome because we've actually had our, we and our underwriters have actually had discussions with investors.  But you can't shortcut the deal by going direct to the investors because they're relying on the Fed fees, and the Fed fees have to get through the rating agencies and the Fed first.
Richard Moore: Did you guys talk about a cap rate on the assets that you're putting in there, an overall cap rate or some way to think about how you arrived at the total valuation?
Scott Wolstein: Yes, we do know what the cap rate is, but the cap rate is probably not as important as the NOI because, as you know, the rating agencies and the Fed will probably give pretty significant haircuts to NOI when they're trying to rate newly created AAA paper.  In terms of big picture using around a nine cap, we've got about $1.6 billion worth of assets in the two pools combined and we're being guided to $600 million to $700 million of proceeds.
Richard Moore: On mezzanine investments that you guys have, I think you have about 120 million or you did, I think that was a year end number.  What does that pool look like?  I mean, how comfortable are you with what you have in there?
David Oakes: I think we're comfortable with what we have in there today.  There's been a small impairment recognized thus far, but the remainder of it we continue to hold at par.
Richard Moore: So you don't think, Dave, there's any real reason to expect a write-down in there as well.
David Oakes: That's not our expectations.
Richard Moore: The big jump in interest expense in the JVs, when the amount of assets and amount of revenue actually fell in the overall JV portfolio, I'm curious what drove that?  I think it went from $71 million to $84 million of interest expense.
Bill Schafer: That's really related to certain derivative activity primarily at the MDT joint venture.  That was probably over between $8 million and $9 million of that activity and there had been a couple of other loans that have higher rates.  But the biggest piece is the classification of the derivative activity at the MDT venture.
David Oakes: And that's certainly not new derivative activity.  It's simply the mark-to-market on existing interest rate swaps where the goal was to lock rates in place and limit the variability there, but accounting forces us to pull some of that through mark-to-market processing in the income statement.
Richard Moore: So the vast majority of that goes away, I take it, in the next quarter.
David Oakes: Its non-cash and it could go in either direction depending on –
Richard Moore: Exactly.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Baron - Agency Trading Group
Alex Baron: I wanted to ask you in terms of, I guess the difference between the leased occupancy you guys report and physical occupancy.  How much difference in basis points would you say there is perhaps attributed to tenants that have signed the lease but haven't moved in yet, or perhaps dark tenants that are still paying rent?
Dan Hurwitz: In the leased occupant, the leased rate is 90.7% and the physically occupied rate is 89.2%.
Alex Baron: My other question was given that the occupancy kind of remained flat quarter-over-quarter is that fair to say that you guys had basically the same, roughly the same number of tenants that signed new leases versus people who moved out?
Dan Hurwitz: Actually, that's very close.  Just to give you a little insight into how the market is moving and how tough it is.  In the 3.1 million square feet that we executed in this quarter, our net increase of occupied GLA was 81,000 feet.  So that gives you a feel for how much activity has to occur just to tread water.  And obviously, that will change over time because we've lost the bulk of our bankrupt tenant. The other thing to keep in mind is that the asset sales, the assets that we sold were all over 90% leased, so that had an impact on the overall rate as well.  But the net gain of square footage occupied in the quarter was 81,000 square feet and there was 3.1 million square feet leased.
Alex Baron: And what would you say is at the margin for those just focusing on that space that went out and the new space that came in.  What would be the equivalent change in the rent these guys are paying?
Dan Hurwitz: Well, it's hard to say because a lot of the tenants that left were older leases that were dramatically below market.  So I think that overall, I would say probably 10% range is where we would find it.
Scott Wolstein: Well, actually I think somewhere in the script it says what the average rent in the portfolio is today versus what it was before and it actually went up.
Dan Hurwitz: It went up.  We went up 0.6%.  Yes, the average rent overall in the portfolio went up.  And that was primarily driven by the fact that we had a 63% increase in the bankrupt re-leasing in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter, so that did move the needle.
Operator: At this time, we have no additional questions in the queue.  I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Scott Wolstein for any closing remarks.
Scott Wolstein: Once again, thank you everybody for joining us today and for your continued interest in our company.  We believe that our second quarter 2009 operating results were solid despite a lot of accounting noise and a difficult operating environment, and we continue to make significant progress in our various deleveraging initiatives.  We look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter.  All the best, have a great weekend.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference.  That concludes the presentation.  You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."

If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time I’ll turn the call over to Scott Wolstein.
Scott A. Wolstein: Good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. We’ve had a very active quarter and I’d like to begin by going through some of the highlights. At our Investor Day on July 1 we discussed our goals of improving liquidity and lowering leverage and we laid out a very specific plan to focus on achieving those goals in the short term and the long term. While we received consistently positive feedback on our goals, there was also great concern regarding the execution risk involved in achieving those goals. Now just over three months have passed since we previewed the plan and I’m very pleased to report the considerable progress that we’ve already made in such a short time. On July 1 we said that we would reduce total consolidated debt by approximately $1 billion during 2009. On December 31 of 2008 we had $5.9 billion of consolidated debt on our balance sheet. On September 30 of 2009 we had approximately $5.2 billion of consolidated debt or a reduction of over $700 million just over the past nine months, and we are well on our way to our goal of $4.5 billion of consolidated debt by the end of next year. Additionally we reduced our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt by $140 million in the first nine months of the year. We further reduced our debt by another $80 million and we redeemed our interest in our joint venture with MDT this week. All of this resulted in total reduction in our debt of $920 million just this year. We said that we would complete $900 million in new debt financing during 2009. With two months remaining in the year, we have already met our goal by originating $300 million of unsecured notes and approximately $600 million in new mortgage loans. We also currently have the opportunity to close several additional mortgage financings this year. We said that we would retire our senior unsecured notes at discount to par and so far during 2009 we have purchased $250 million of notes through a successful tender offer and another $440 million of notes through open market purchases for a total discount to par of $165 million. We said that we would complete $370 million in asset sales this year and we’ve already completed over $450 million. Our share of debt total is over $300 million. Almost all of these sales have been non-prime assets and have contributed to the de-leveraging effort by reducing our debt by over $300 million, $65 million of which was our share of secured mortgage debt encumbering these assets. And the balance of the proceeds repaid unsecured notes and [inaudible] balances. We also referenced a discretionary equity raise of $300 million and we have already executed on over half of this, in addition to the $110 million of equity raised from the Otto family. In total we have generated more than $1.5 billion of new capital year-to-date and $1.1 billion of new capital since our Investor Day which has been applied to lower leverage, enhance liquidity and extend maturities. Bond and mortgage maturities through 2012 have been reduced from $2.3 billion to $1.7 billion just during the last four months. We said that we would simplify our structure and we have redeemed our interest in our joint venture with MDT this week. As mentioned earlier, this eliminated a net $80 million of debt for DDR and our pro rata share. We now own 100% of three high quality prime assets as a result of this reduction. Finally we said that we would work diligently to re-tenant space formerly occupied by a bank of retailers. We have generated real activity on over 55% of that space in the form of either signed leases, sales, leases pending signature or letters of intent, and we are gaining traction as retailers firm up their 2010 and 2011 opening plans. We continue to be prudent in evaluating deal terms, and while rents have moderated we have been successful in driving economically efficient deals with lower than average capital expenditures. Bill, Dan and David will go into more detail on all these items. We are very pleased that we have been able to execute on our plan thus far, but we know we have much more work to do. In our Investor Day presentation we laid out plans for 2010, 2011 and beyond and we will keep our energies appropriately focused in order to continue to successfully execute upon these plans. Despite the high level of transactional activity this year, we have not lost sight of the operational side of the business. Results were quite solid considering the continued challenging environment, with operating FFO per share results coming in at $0.44 per share which met our expectations. Given the continued challenges of the environment, we are very pleased with the performance of our portfolio and of our team. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Bill who will go into more detail on the operating results.
William H. Schafer: Thanks Scott. As just mentioned, our operating FFO for the third quarter was $0.44 which was in line with our expectations after taking into account the significant transactional and financing activity executed during the quarter. Including several non-operating and generally non-cash items aggregating approximately $165 million, the FFO loss per share was $0.54. Now I’ll walk through some of the details regarding the specific non-operational items aggregating $165 million, most of which are non-recurring and substantially all of which are non-cash. These items are also clearly broken out on the front page of our earnings release. The most significant non-operating non-cash items were primarily attributed to the appreciation of our share price and the requirement that the Otto transaction be treated as a mark-to-market derivative. This was discussed in detail last quarter and now that the final tranche of the Otto equity has closed, the ongoing mark-to-market adjustment will be much less. The other non-operating and non-cash charges primarily relate to two joint ventures that have seen the market value of their portfolios decline from their formation to today, largely related to an increase in cap rates. The aforementioned charges are partially offset by a $24 million gain on repurchase of debt and a $3.5 million gain on the sale of MDT units which we sold above the price at which we had carried them. In other operating results, same-store NOI for the quarter was down 5% and down 4.1% for the year. This is in line with our previous guidance of 4% decline in same-store NOI for 2009. The decline continues to be largely attributed to the bankruptcy of Goody’s, Linens ‘N Things, Circuit City and Steve & Barry’s. As with previous quarters, our Brazil portfolio continues to perform very well with the same-store net operating increase of 11% for the quarter. Our third quarter general and administrative expenses include some additional one time charges relating to severance and executive retention, aggregating $2.7 million. This in addition to the $4.9 million of non-cash changing control charges discussed in our earnings release. Therefore excluding the above charges our general and administrative expense for the quarter would have been approximately $18.5 million. Next I’d like to discuss our continuing compliance with debt covenants. At Investor Day we projected improvement in both our bank and bond covenant ratios by year end 2009. I am pleased to report that the bank covenant that has historically been tightest for us, the unencumbered asset ratio, has continued to improve to approximately 1.75 times from 1.63 times at year end 2008 and from 1.67 times at June 30. Our consolidated outstanding debt to consolidated market value ratio was well below the 60% limitation at approximately 53% as of September 30. Our execution on various de-leveraging initiatives including asset sales, equity issuance and retained capital, will continue to improve these ratios over time, giving us increased flexibility quarter by quarter. In addition, as we continue to increase our occupancy back closer to long term norms, these ratios should improve further. With regard to our liquidity position, at September 30 we had over $500 million of unrestricted cash on hand and revolver availability. Our cash on hand and revolver availability was only $150 million as of June 30. So we have made considerable progress in enhancing our liquidity position. Finally I’d like to discuss the decision to pay an all cash dividend of $0.02 for the third quarter. After it was determined that we would be able to meet the minimum payout required to meet REIT status for 2009, the board approved the continuation of the cash portion of the prior two quarters dividend of $0.02 per share in order to retain additional capital and enhance financial flexibility while remaining committed to distributing some cash flows to our investors. Now I’ll turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you Bill, and good morning everyone. I would like to begin with a brief update on the leasing and retail environment, particularly as we head into the most important retail season of the year. Fortunately, back-to-school retail sales were encouraging and we see reason to believe that operating margins for retailers will continue to remain stable, even if comp store sales results are moderate or negative. Retailers continue to prove their resilience and display their ability to control inventory levels and buy right, which should lead to lower clearance levels and less gross margin deterioration compared to last year. While lowering inventory levels are generally a positive strategy in a recessionary environment, it could also create headwinds for retailers if the consumer returns to the store in greater numbers than expected and inventory is sparse. It will be very interesting to watch this phenomenon and we remain cautiously optimistic for the holiday season as the consumer clearly prefers and is aggressively seeking value and convenience. In regard to specific quarterly metrics during the third quarter, we signed 146 new leases representing over 737,000 square feet of GLA and 287 renewal deals representing over 1.85 million square feet of GLA. On a blended basis, there were 433 deals executed during the second quarter representing nearly 2.6 million square feet of GLA and an average rental spread of 3.5. Importantly, of the 737,000 square feet of new deals signed during the third quarter, 44% represent space that was previously vacant and over 20,000 square feet and thus non-income producing prior to these new leases. When combined with our releasing of spaces in Q2, these deals alone will contribute over $9.5 million per year of base rent when the tenants assume occupancy over the next 18 months. Please note that we have added new disclosure to the supplement on leasing activity and costs in our effort to continue to provide maximum transparency. This information is contained in Section 5. We are pleased with the volume of leasing activity achieved during the third quarter, especially coming off our record setting second quarter. While maximizing rent spreads remains challenging, we are pleased to see a marginal improvement on blended rental rate spreads over the previous quarter, and are particularly pleased with the over 5.5 million square feet of leasing done in the second and third quarters combined. From a capital expenditure perspective, the cost of executing deals has decreased 17% on per square foot basis from the same period one year ago as we continue to utilize existing fixtures and improvements when we back fill boxes and focus on making the most efficient deal with our retail partners. Our successful leasing results can be attributed to the quality of our real estate, the operating platform, the absence of new development projects and an extraordinarily focused and aggressive leasing team. As retailers seek external growth opportunities, the supply of new space is limited and therefore retailers must rely on second and third generation space available in the market. Good real estate will get leased, and we continue to receive significant interest in our portfolio from many of the most successful and aggressive retailers looking to capitalize on this opportunity. Most importantly we remain focused on our tenant relationships and have invested our human capital wisely by staying in front of tenants, conducting portfolio reviews and discussing new store opportunities. During the third quarter we held several productive meetings with many of the most active retailers within our portfolio including but not limited to Hobby Lobby, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Kohl’s, HHGregg, Jo-Ann Stores, Dollar Tree and regional grocers such as [Sprats]. Other tenants with whom we have met such as TJX Companies, the parent company of TJMaxx, Marshalls, AJWright and HomeGoods, also remain desirous of new locations. We have multiple executed leases or an active lease or LOI negotiations with each of the retailers just mentioned. As we enter the fourth quarter and evaluate the importance of holiday sales and consumer fundamentals for many of the tenants in our portfolio, I think it’s also important to note the capital markets activity that has recently occurred, particularly for the retailers, that many landlords have on their watch lists. Last quarter as you may recall I mentioned the positive capital raising for Wal-Mart and TJX Companies. This quarter Blockbuster was successful with their issuance of a five year senior unsecured notes, Dollar General continues to advance their discussions regarding plans for an IPO by leveraging positive sales and profitability trends, and Office Depot recently closed on a significant capital raising event which provides increased liquidity to the office supply retailer. Earlier this week Rite Aid priced ten year senior secured notes and the transaction is expected to close on Monday. While these retailers represent a small portion of our entire portfolio, their recent capital raising initiatives indicate increased access to capital for the retail sector. While no amount of capital can hide poor merchandising, operations or sales, even the best merchants cannot survive without capital and signs of capital availability to retailers have become more positive over the past few months. Regarding portfolio occupancy, as discussed on last quarter’s conference call we believe that our second quarter portfolio leased rate marked a trough for our portfolio. At the end of the second quarter of this year, our leased rate remained constant at 90.7%. The fact that we were able to hold our leased rate flat quarter over quarter, coupled with the fact that we have historically experienced drops in occupancy from the first quarter to the second quarter, was a strong indication that we were truly operating at a soft bottom. As of September 30, 2009, our portfolio leased rate was 90.9%, a 20 basis point improvement over the prior quarter. Some of the properties sold this quarter had leased rates above our portfolio average, so on a more same-store basis our leased rate would have shown an even larger increase this quarter. We expect continued marginal improvement as we head toward year end with the impending impact of holiday sales as the primary influence on occupancy for the first quarter of 2010 and beyond. In terms of addressing our big box vacancies, we continue to make significant progress in the re-leasing and backfilling of junior anchor and anchor spaces within our bankrupt tenant portfolio. As of September 30, we had 55% of the units solid, leased, at leased or in LOI negotiations. We are committed to re-tenanting space creatively with strong credit tenants while maximizing the reuse of existing improvements and minimizing capital outlays. Growth in rental revenue remains a priority for our company, and as a result we are committed to realizing the opportunity to organically grow earnings through internal means beyond historical averages. While significant upside potential remains from lease up, it is worth noting that our new business development team continues to creatively generate significant rental revenues via temporary and seasonal leasing of both big box and in line vacant units. Specifically, we signed 84 deals with Halloween operators this year, representing a 79% increase in deal volume year-over-year in that particular focus of our seasonal leasing initiatives. All told our new business development department generated over $8.4 million of ancillary revenues during the third quarter, a 30% increase over the same period last year, providing a mitigating factor against lost rental revenues and further declines in NOI due to retailer fallout. Regarding bad debt in our portfolio, our bad debt expense as a percent of revenue has grown in the past year, particularly among small local tenants. These tenants make up a large portion of our grocery anchored portfolio, and as a result bad debt is a much larger percentage of revenue in our joint venture portfolio than in the rest of our assets. The southeast is particularly affected with more than twice the amount of bad debt than any other region of the country. We are not surprised by this trend and had contemplated such results in our operating metrics and prior guidance. Turning for a brief moment to our operations in Brazil, I am pleased to report continued growth and stability within our portfolio, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment. As of September 30, as Bill mentioned, same-store NOI grew 11% and the portfolio leased rate remains strong at 96%. Our new development in Manaus which opened in the second quarter has stabilized at 96% leased and our ancillary income initiatives in Brazil continue to produce exceptional results with our cart and kiosk programs leading the way. Overall we continue to be very pleased with our Brazilian operations and we expect the portfolio to be a significant contributor to overall growth over the next several years. In summary, we continue to be pleased with our operating platform amid the challenging retail environment and are cautiously optimistic headed into year end. While many have declared the recession over, I can assure you that the joy is not universally felt across Main Street. Various economic and unemployment uncertainties remain for the consumer, particularly as we head into this holiday season, and we remain focused on leveraging our tenant relationships as they are the key element to our operating success and present the clearest opportunity for recovery and future growth. At this time I’d like to turn the call over to David.
David J. Oakes: Thanks Dan. As mentioned we’ve made good progress on the various initiatives that we announced at Investor Day. I will go into a little more detail on a few of these and I’d like to focus on the effects of these actions on our balance sheet and maturities schedule as well as our capital plans for the next year. We completed a successful tender offer in mid-September, buying back $250 million of our senior unsecured notes at 91% of par. The tender offer achieved our goal of retiring unsecured notes with a heavy weighting toward the near dated maturities. In addition to the tender offer, we retired $48 million of 2010, ’11 and ’12 notes on the open market during the third quarter at an average 86% of par. In total, we eliminated approximately $30 million of debt through the discounts to par that were achieved in the third quarter. We also raised $300 million of new senior unsecured notes maturing in 2016. Our capital plan for Investor Day had called for our return to the unsecured market with $250 million raise in 2011. However, the unsecured markets opened to us in recent months and we decided to take advantage of the opportunity. This offering of long term debt to repay short term debt extends the duration of our overall debt and fits very well within our maturity profile. The offering also served as an important signal of the availability of capital that exists for us from many sources. The interest rate was much higher than our historic experience and we remain highly focused on executing upon the balance sheet improvements that will lower this cost over time. In the third quarter we also closed on $17 million of new 6% long term mortgage financing on two small assets. Subsequent to quarter end we closed on a new five year mortgage financing with an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. The new long term debt proceeds were used to retire mortgages with near term maturities, retire 2010 bonds and lower the balance on our line of credit. We also sold $220 million of equity in the quarter. In addition the second tranche of the equity sold to the Otto family, we issued almost $160 million of equity through the common equity dribble program at an average price of more than $8.50 per share. These equity sales provide a portion of the capital that we expect to raise in order to lower our leverage and provide us a greater flexibility on the timing of additional issuance. In addition, we sold over $450 million of mostly non-prime assets in 2009 and approximately $270 million in the third quarter, with a closing occurring almost every week since late May. After taking into account all of the above items including the activity thus far in the fourth quarter, I’m very happy to report that we have no remaining 2009 debt maturities, and all but six of our wholly owned 2010 mortgage maturities amounting to $59 million have been repaid. As Scott mentioned, we reduced our consolidated debt by over $700 million in the first nine months of the year, and we reduced our unconsolidated debt by over $100 million. Since the end of the second quarter we have retired $102 million of 2009 debt, $215 million of 2010 debt, $437 million of 2011 debt and $227 million of 2012 debt. In addition to significantly reducing the amount of debt outstanding, we have also extended duration by more than a year with our weighted average maturity now more than three years out. Turning now to the current strategy and focus for the next year, first, we will continue to sell non-prime assets to third parties. However, due to the success of our capital raising initiatives year-to-date, we do not feel an urgency to sell assets at fire sale prices to raise capital. As evidenced by the $450 million of asset sales this year, retailers, wealthy families, local individuals and some 1031 buyers continue to be active in the transactions market. We have another $150 million in assets that are contract for sale or subject to LOI currently. We continue to look at asset sales as a good source of capital, only when pricing is acceptable and generally when assets do not fit our focus on prime properties. Second, we will continue to repurchase our unsecured notes if discounts to par remain. If discounts on the nearest term maturities evaporate, we will preserve ample room on our revolving credit facilities to address them upon maturity. Third, we will have a new common equity dribble program at our disposal where we can sell equity in the open market at our discretion. This program is an extension of the $200 million equity dribble program that we announced last fall and will allow us to sell up to an additional $200 million of common stock over the course of the next three years. Fourth, we have the potential to complete several other secured financings at our discretion in the next several months. We don’t see these transactions as necessary to meet our near term maturities, but we remain open to the potential to close on additional secured debt to provide us with additional liquidity. We are encouraged by the continued opening in the capital markets and the success that other leading REIT’s have had in raising long term debt and equity. At Investor Day we also spoke about our focus on a debt-to-EBITDA ratio and our expectations for future improvement. This is a metric that we will continue to use to measure our leverage, and we are working diligently to improve this ratio. I’d like to turn your attention to Page 2.4 of our supplement where we’ve added two debt-to-EBITDA calculations for recent periods. The first is a consolidated calculation and the second is a true pro rata calculation. We hope this makes it easier for you to track our status and our progress as we steadily de-lever. We will also use this ratio and more importantly the improvement in this ratio as one of the key metrics to determine executive compensations. Finally I’d like to address the MDT redemption that we announced recently. An MDT unit holder vote was held on October 19, the redemption was approved and we have now closed the transaction that results in DDR receiving 100% ownership in three properties in exchange for our 14.5% interest in the U.S. REIT joint venture with MDT. This transaction simplifies our structure, provides MDT with more flexibility to recapitalize, and eliminates considerable near term debt maturities from DDR’s pro rata maturity schedule. We continue to actively co-manage the trust and aggressively lease its assets. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Scott for closing comments.
Scott A. Wolstein: Thanks David. I’d like to wrap up the call be reiterating the guidance we gave in the press release in September of $1.90 to $2 per share in operating FFO for 2009, which excludes any non-recurring items. Finally, I’d like to thank the DDR team for their hard work these past few months. As you’ve heard, we’ve made great progress on our de-leveraging and liquidity enhancing plans, and we will continue to execute aggressively on those goals. With that, we’ll take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Wigginton - Macquarie Research Equities.
David Wigginton: Can you guys maybe talk a little bit about same-store NOI trends on a sequential basis? Meaning from maybe the second quarter to the third quarter.
William H. Schafer: From the second quarter to the third quarter the same-store NOI was pretty consistent at 5% decline.
David Wigginton: So just same-store NOI in general from second quarter, what was the number then versus what was the number in the third quarter? I mean was there a decline in same-store NOI from second quarter to the third quarter?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You know we measure it and the numbers we provide are on an annual, you know year-over-year basis and so those are the traditional numbers we give out. On a quarterly sequential basis we haven’t provided those. We can certainly dig deeper into it. Our expectation would be there was a modest improvement, flat to slight improvement between the third quarter of this year and the second quarter of this year based on the metrics that show up in our supplemental although we’ve not specifically calculated that number on a sequential basis.
William H. Schafer: Yes, David, you know you really shouldn’t expect to see very much quarter-to-quarter at this time of the year because you know even though we’ve signed a lot of leases, tenants really take occupancy in our business either in the spring or in the fall. So you know there’d be very few of the you know additional leases that were signed during the quarter would ever translate into same-store NOI until at the very earliest November when they start to take occupancy for holiday sales. And then even more so based on calendar next spring.
David Wigginton: No, I understand. I’m just trying to get a feel for the trend at this point.
William H. Schafer: It’s pretty flat you know from quarter-to-quarter on that basis.
David Wigginton: My second question is related to the expense recovery ratio. It dropped pretty sharply in the quarter. Just wondering what obviously a result of bankruptcies but even the trend versus second quarter seemed to tail off a little bit in the third quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove that down?
William H. Schafer: It’s primarily the nature of the expenses. As we indicated in our supplement, our bad debt expense was up significantly from where it was a year ago. And when you look at the I’ll say the additional landlord expenses associated with maintaining the vacant units, i.e. like utility bills and so forth that are typically paid directly by tenants, when those units become vacant they now become the landlord’s responsibility. A lot of this is really related to the Mervyn’s portfolio. When you look at the nature of those expenses, they increased you know well over $3 million compared to the prior year. Combine that with the increase in the real estate taxes and again the real estate taxes, a number of those items we are certainly appealing, but the process is expensive in that area. So when you look at the overall increase of well over $4 million in what I will refer to as non-recoverable related expenses, that had the biggest impact on that recovery ratio.
David Wigginton: What was the bad debt expense as a percent of total revenues?
William H. Schafer: For the quarter it was I believe around 2.4% if we disclose it, its $4.8 for the quarter, $4.8 million is the bad debt expense. And that’s reflected in our earnings release.
Operator: Your next question comes from Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman: Just on the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which is still stubbornly high despite some of the de-levering you’ve done, I know you’ve got an 8.3 times target for the end of this year. And to get there it seems to be only the real way would be raising about $500 million of equity or selling up to $500 million of land, a combination of the both. Could you just comment on where you’re at with those two things?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And this is exactly why we want to have that calculation out there to highlight our focus on it and the progress we’re making, but I don’t think the requirements are as great as you’ve indicated to achieve what we’ve indicated is our targets. The single biggest change between what would be a fourth quarter calculation and that number which is what we had discussed at the analyst day versus the third, fourth quarter calculations outlined in our supplemental today, is simply the seasonality of NOI and the annualization of that income stream. So simply from seasonality if we were truly comparing you know apples to apples comparison of what we gave in the Investor Day presentation versus what’s provided in the supplemental, you know using 3Q NOI is a considerable difference, even just based on the leases that are in place today and the ancillary income contracts that are in place today versus what showed up in third quarter. So I think that’s an important part of it which is simply seasonality. Secondly while you know we’re pleased with the activity that we’ve achieved thus far on the de-levering front, there should be no assumption that we believe we’re done with that. And there are you know considerable additional initiatives planned just for the next several months in terms of continuing to improve that ratio. None of which get to the size of the $500 million plus of transactional activity you indicate in terms of an equity raise, but certainly a great focus on additional de-leveraging initiatives to continue to move that debt-to-EBITDA calculation lower and more in line with what we guided to July 1.
William H. Schafer: Also you know I think let’s talk about the apples to apples comparison as to what we presented on Investor Day. That number at 8.3 was on a consolidated basis and right now at the end of Q3 we were at 9.2 and today we’re even below that. So the delta really isn’t that great, apples to apples. And you know I’ve noticed a trend among analysts you know to look at de-leveraging as a one way street, that the only way you de-lever is by raising equity. You also de-lever by raising NOI and a very significant component of the increase in our debt-to-EBITDA is not because we increased debt, it’s because we lost EBITDA with the bankruptcies of these tenants. And as those tenant spaces are re-leased, EBITDA will rise and the ratio will come down, even without equity raised. So it’s really a two way street. It’s a combination of two metrics you know converging in the middle. Yes, we will raise more equity but yes we will also raise NOI and EBITDA and that debt-to-EBITDA ratio will continue to decline.
Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman: Are you still progressing with some potential land sales in the meantime?
William H. Schafer: Land sales? I’m sorry.
Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman: Yes, are you still progressing? I think at the Investor Day presentation you said there’s up to $500 plus million dollars of book value of land that you were looking at selling.
Scott A. Wolstein: Yes. That’s very much a part of our strategy.
Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman: And is it progressing?
Scott A. Wolstein: Slowly. I mean this is obviously the most difficult time in the history of the United States to sell development property. But you know there are interested parties in some parcels and yes it is proceeding.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well and I think you know we really outlined that as an opportunity more so than a specific part of our plan and our requirement. We do believe that relative to the size of the company overall today and our targets going forward that the development pipeline will likely be reduced relative to the size that it is today. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have a considerable you know pipeline going forward and commitment to that, but I do think there’s an opportunity to take some capital out of that pool of non-earning assets today that can considerably help these ratios. And so it’s something we’re focused on. It is not the requirement part of the plan. It is certainly not a quick fix given the timing it takes to get those transactions closed, but it is an opportunity for additional de-levering for us over the next year or so.
William H. Schafer: But to be more specific Quentin we have very, very serious interest in some parcels up in Canada where we have a significant investment. And we also you know where you’re probably going to see the most land sales are going to be in development properties that we are in the entitlement process and we have pending deals with anchor tenants who will buy their [pads] as soon as we get entitlement. So you know all of this is in process and yes we do expect it to happen on a pretty methodical basis.
Quentin Velleley for Michael Bilerman: In terms of the $400 million secured loan with Goldman, which you’re obviously working towards making TALF eligible, we’ve heard from a few people that the rate was about 9% in the interim. If it’s unsuccessful in becoming TALF eligible, does that rate hold up?
David J. Oakes: The long term rate is not determined today and given where we are in the process is not something that we are able to discuss at this time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt - BofA Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt: Of the 55% of the vacant boxes that have been impacted and I guess this is for Dan, is it possible to break out those that are LOI’s versus those that are lease assigned or sold?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, in fact it’s in the supplement in our new disclosure section, Page 5. So we have 19% are actually sold or leased, 9% are at lease, 27% are at LOI and that totals the 55%. Section 5. We gave you a lot of detail, Craig, particularly the locations, the tenants, the square footage and something a lot of people have been asking about is lease terms , the term of the lease, so we actually included that as well.
Craig Schmidt: The second question I guess is for David. He started to touch on it. On the $450 of non-prime assets you sold, who were the buyers of that? Who’s the most interested in you know and maybe describe them, give a little color on them for me.
David J. Oakes: Yes. It’s been a different profile than the traditional leaders in the transactions market, you know for us that $450 million of transactions is nearly 40 separate sales to 40 different groups. So you can see that none of these is necessarily a major headline that was the exclusive driver of that. It has been a large number of local individuals who know market very well. We have selectively sold some stores back to retailers. At this point our retailers cost of capital is dramatically lower than ours and we’ve sought to take advantage of that giving them control of their box long term and providing us with capital at a better cost. We’ve selectively sold some assets into the 1031 market, where the stability of the traditional cash flows from our sort of long term leases can be well appreciated by individuals that are both you know trying to buy acceptable quality assets but more so to manage their tax situation. At this point we are seeing more interest coming into the markets from various larger sources, but the activity year-to-date has been a lot of smaller transactions with wealthy individuals, local operators, retailers and 1031 participants.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group.
Alex Barron: Can you talk a little bit more about your seasonal and Halloween stores? How much did that improve the occupancy in terms of square feet and basis points?
Scott A. Wolstein: We don’t include that in the occupancy metrics, you know, frankly. It’s in our revenue, it’s in our NOI but we don’t treat that as an occupied unit.
Alex Barron: Could you elaborate a little bit more maybe, I missed it, on what caused the sequential increase in dollars in the SG&A line?
William H. Schafer: The increase there, obviously we had the second portion of the change of control charge which was approximately $4.9 million, and that was mentioned right on the face I think of our earnings release. Then there was some severance in the executive retention cost that netted about $2.7 million that was incurred in the third quarter. If you eliminate those items you’re down to approximately about $18.5 million in G&A for the third quarter.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Alex, just to your earlier question on Halloween, it’s a very good question because we are starting to see some temporary tenant deals creep into occupancy rates in our industry. And it’s not something that we have historically done. Some companies draw a bright line and they say if the tenant’s in occupancy for five months or six months we’ll include them, some say if it’s a year. We have always taken the position not to include our ancillary income tenants in our occupancy and we have resisted to do that now, primarily because we want to make sure that we can provide you with an apples to apples analysis of where the portfolio was and where the portfolio has gone.
Alex Barron: And on that front, is the occupancy you report then only for your wholly owned properties? Or does it include joint ventures as well?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It includes joint ventures as well.
Alex Barron: And do you have like a physical occupancy versus leased?
Scott A. Wolstein: Yes. The difference is about 200 basis points. Historically for those of you who have followed that trend line for the company, when we were at our highest occupancy levels in the history of the company when we were between 96% and 97% leased, we would be anywhere between 20 and maybe 50 basis points spread. When we had the last significant round of bankruptcies which were the Home Place, K-mart days if you will, that spread went to about 150 basis points because obviously you lose all those tenants at one time and then of course you fill them up over an extended period of time. Today we’re actually at the highest spread we’ve seen. We’re at 200 basis point spread between our physical occupancy and our leased [ream]. And that is not unexpected. In fact it’s positive. It means that you know we lost a number of tenants which wasn’t positive, but the good news is that our lease velocity is very high which is causing that spread to increase and obviously that will decrease over time as tenants open. But right now the majority of the deals that we’ve done in our bankrupt portfolio particularly those tenants are not open and will not open until later this year and in most cases next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan.
Michael Mueller: First question for Dan. With respect to the box leasing for the bankrupt tenants, I think that was 9% and maybe 20-some percent or along those lines for LOI as well as signed leases. Can you walk us through a rough timeline as to when you see that coming online and how much of it maybe spring of ’10, how much of it back into ’10 and how much thereafter?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. For what we have in process today, Mike, most of that will be impactful to our numbers in the late fall of ’10. But even what is, if you look at the projected opening dates, even what we have completed or near completed we still will have some leakage into ’11. I think if you’re looking at an annualized basis, the fall of ’11 is going to be where we’re starting to see significant pickup from the momentum of leasing that we’ve seen over the last two quarters.
Michael Mueller: And then David, kind of going back a second to the debt-to-EBITDA conversation, I know at Investor Day you talked about a different metric used to consolidate metric, but if we’re looking at the pro rata method now, can you talk about where you think that metric could be from the combination of NOI lease up as well as just you know incremental right hand side of the balance sheet de-levering at say year end ’10? And where you think it could be a year after that or so?
David J. Oakes: Yes. The guidance you know given at the Investor Day was based upon the consolidated metric which as we’ve talked to a broader group of investors and you know dug into more what other companies were doing, you know, was not the primary focus. And we’ve provided both the consolidated metric as well as the pro rata metrics here so you can see where we stand on both. I think the improvement that is expected over the various periods of time is consistent. However, when you think about the change in either one of those variables we’ve guided to relative to the end of 2008, a little greater than you know one time decline and a one-and-a-quarter point time decline in the consolidated metric and what we had discussed previously. And I think it would be consistent with that on a pro rata basis. And that’s a number that we think is achievable and we hope to exceed.
William H. Schafer: Michael, you know I think it’s important to note that the redemption of our MDT interest didn’t occur during the third quarter. It just occurred in October. So when you’re looking at pro rata indebtedness you have to remove you know another $80 million of debt in doing that debt-to-EBITDA calculation.
Michael Mueller: Going to the dividend for a second, I mean what sort of color can you give us at this point about the plan in 2010 for either a dividend level, number one, or just the split between cash and stock? Will you continue to utilize the stock dividend as you did for a chunk of this year and return to cash?
William H. Schafer: Yes, that’s going to be a board decision. That will be taken up at our next board meeting. So we’ll be able to give you firm guidance on that very soon.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Vedder - Green Street Advisors.
Nick Vedder: It seems like there’s been some positive news from the retailer perspective as of late. Can you tell me what you’ve been hearing from generally? And has that changed more recently?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well you know retailers you know they’re always posturing and they’re always positioning. And I think things particularly for a lot of the value, the moderate to budget priced retailers that we deal with primarily weren’t quite as bad as they wanted everyone to think they were. And now they’re realizing that there’s opportunity that sales are pretty good. They’re comfortable that they have their inventories in line. You know that doesn’t happen overnight. That takes a number of quarters to adjust. And the results are good. Margins have been maintained. You know while same-store sales are really unimpressive, clearly retailers are hitting their plan and they’re able to make some money. So I think they’ve figured out how to operate in this environment, and as a result they’re trying to take advantage of the fact that they have a significant amount of leverage. And in some cases some retailers today are running out there without competition, for the first time in the history of their company they don’t have any major national competitor that is competing with them for space. And they’re taking full advantage of that. So it’s going to be interesting to see. This ties back a little bit to what we just talked about with Mike because while we have some opening dates, rank commencement dates that are pretty far out for the deals that we have done now, the retailer has the right to accelerate that date. And we’re not counting on that by any measure, but if in fact we end up with a good holiday and if in fact some of the 2011 deals that we’re looking at today would fit nicely into a 2010 open to buy for a retailer that has just gone from wanting to do 40 stores to 50, then we may see some of that move up in the pecking order. Like I said we’re not counting on that, but there’s a lot of movement still out there. It’s still an extremely fluid situation. But the conversations with retailers are clearly better than they were last quarter, a lot better than they were in the first quarter. And of course you know the fourth quarter last year wasn’t even worth taking the call. So I think we’re seeing some positive traction. We’re encouraged by it. You know for us to do over 5.5 million feet over the last two quarters of leasing is a very, very big number and we hope that that trend continues.
Nick Vedder: You mentioned that some of the retailers that took your big box space can move up their opening date. Can they delay their opening date as well?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: They can’t. They can delay their opening date, but they can’t delay their rent commencement date. So for example they can decide not to open, but they have to start paying us rent on that outside date. So really the way the lease would typically read is that they have to pay rent the earlier of when they open for business to the public or the rent commencement date.
Nick Vedder: And then can you give your expectations for same-store NOI growth in 2010?
William H. Schafer: Well you know we’re going through those numbers now, Nick, and I think it would be imprudent for us to be aggressive on that quite frankly. You know as we look at the numbers and you see what’s happening and there are still some distressed retailers out there, I think on a very, very optimistic front you would be about flat and on a more realistic we probably will be less negative than it was this year. It’s hard to see a scenario where it’s going to turn dramatically positive.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think Nick just to be clear that you know we had a full quarter basically of Circuit City rent in 2009. So that’s a headwind in terms of a same-store NOI calculation. We would have to lease all of that space you know essentially for a full quarter in 2010 just to be even. So you know if you look at same-store NOI you know, backing out the bankruptcy space, it will be positive. But we still have to overcome that negative comp from Circuit City.
Nick Vedder: And then also there’s a reference to a 9% rate on the Goldman loan of $400 million. Can you confirm if that’s indeed correct?
William H. Schafer: That’s the ancillary rate until the loan is securitized. Correct.
Nick Vedder: And what is your sense of timing in terms of that loan being securitized?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You know I’d like to tell you, but we are under strict orders from our lawyers since this is a 144A private placement that we can’t talk about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Haberman - Goldman Sachs.
Jay Haberman: Can you address the joint venture debt coming due in 2010? I know you mentioned bad debt’s been picking up in the joint venture portfolio and it looks like some of the assets that you’re selling there have been at sort of fire sale pricing, more on the $60 a square foot range. So can you speak a bit just how you’re going to address the debt coming due next year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes I think we can. A lot of that is going to be consistent with some of the short term strategies that we’ve employed this year where we have had considerable success extending CMBS maturities by a year and buying additional time. We are in progress on some early stages, but some longer term refinancings of various pieces, a 2010 joint venture debt that’s maturing. And also I think we are with perhaps only one exception fortunate enough to have you know high quality, well capitalized joint venture partners that have historically been willing to fund equity requirements for those portfolios.
Jay Haberman: For what’s coming due next year do you anticipate having to inject additional equity?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We haven’t firmly determined that yet at this point. We continue to see capital markets improving. We continue to see availability of debt capital becoming greater and greater and right now we think that we’ll be able to refinance or extend a considerable portion of that debt. I think its obviously important to note that we no longer have an equity interest in the MDT assets which is where the largest 2010 debt maturities are. But even on those assets which we manage and that trust which we manage we continue to make progress regarding the 2010 debt.
Jay Haberman: And then maybe just in addition, can you give us a reference point just for where cap rates are today? I know you clearly have been selling some assets you mentioned to investors and wealthy families but can you give us a sense of the returns that they’re anticipating?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, it’s hard to speak to exactly what returns in NOI they’re expecting. But from our perspective numbers that we could agree upon you know we are transacting in lower quality assets in tertiary markets, so certainly non-prime assets at cap rates in the low nines. These assets on average recently have been more highly occupied than our portfolio as a whole. So its been a headwind a little bit to our occupancy pickup over all, but the reason that there’s been a focus on selling some of those along with everything we’ve sold is we generally believe there could be a negative NOI profile over the next several years for those assets. So you know I think one, it’s one thing to say they’re lower quality assets, but I think we also believe that that cap rate is not completely reflective of what we believe to be future year returns because we do generally expect some greater NOI challenges within what’s being sold versus what’s being retained.
Scott A. Wolstein: It’s important to point out, Jay, that we are seeing a significant new appetite from foreign investors for quality assets. You know we’re not selling our prime assets but we’re entertaining dialog on potential joint ventures and you know it shouldn’t be surprising to anybody that you know the weak dollar is causing the discussions on cap rates on foreign capital to be much lower than they were a year ago you know at this time. So you know we’re starting to see some firming and on the better assets I think if we wanted to sell them I think we’d certainly be in the eights and maybe on some of them even in the sevens.
Jay Haberman: If I could follow up with a question Scott, but does that change your sort of strategy a bit? Instead of selling your maybe non-prime and sort of switching? Because you referenced backing off asset sales and possibly using the line of credit to repurchase unsecureds but you know maybe this is a good time to start selling some of your better quality at lower cap rates, given the foreign demand.
Scott A. Wolstein: We really are being very, very disciplined about keeping control of our prime assets and we really don’t need to sell them. We can joint venture them you know and maintain them in the portfolio and that would be our preference if we were going to do anything. And we shouldn’t confuse that with you know the sale of non-prime assets because the sale of the non-prime assets is really not a capital raising initiative. It is a quality of the portfolio initiative which is intended to over time increase the organic growth rate of the portfolio over all without the requirement of investing capital for its general growth. So we’re going to continue all the assets we don’t want to own whenever we can get a reasonable offer. And we’re going to keep the other assets in the stable if you will, either wholly owned or in joint ventures.
Jay Haberman: And then last question I guess for Dan on leasing velocity you mentioned has been strong, but in terms of the breakout I guess it’s a three to one margin tour of renewals versus new leases. But at the same time you mentioned the gap between leased versus occupied. Do you see the current occupancy as in fact the bottom, this 88 I guess when you include the vacant boxes for this cycle?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I do, Jay. I think we’re going to have increased occupancy marginally in the fourth quarter. And I think we’ll continue to grow from there. I think one of the things that we’re looking to do is to be around that 250,000 feet of box space per quarter. That’s an important number for us to meet our projections as we go forward. You know we’ve exceeded it the last couple of quarters but it won’t be that way forever and we know that. But based on what we have in the pipeline today, we think we’re very comfortable with that level and that velocity of leasing. And that’s what’s going to move the number because you know quite frankly our renewals, our percentage of renewal retention is still very, very high in our portfolio because we have good assets and tenants are doing business. It doesn’t mean they don’t ask for rent concessions. But if you say no to them, the vast majority of these people are renewing anyway. And I think that’s going to continue if not get better as the economy gets a little better. And I think our velocity of 250 to maybe at the peak 300,000 feet of basic box space, if we can do that on a quarterly basis we’re going to be able to really drive not only our occupancy but our rental growth.
Jay Haberman: Did you mention that the pickup in NOI based on what’s leased to date that’s $9 million on a full year basis?
William H. Schafer: That’s $9.6 million on what was just leased in our anchor store redevelopment portfolio between last quarter and this quarter. That’s right. On an annualized basis.
Jay Haberman: That’s an annual number for next year.
William H. Schafer: Well it may not be an annual number for next year because some of those tenants will open in ’11. So it’ll be a partial number for next year and you’ll get the vast majority of that in ’11, but the first full year, total full year of what we just did in Q2 and Q3 will probably be ’12.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore: Hey Bill just to finish up a previous question. Where does that leave 4Q G&A then?
William H. Schafer: 4Q G&A?
Richard Moore: Yes, because you know you had the one time Otto type things and then you had the compensation.
William H. Schafer: Right. The fourth quarter will be higher than the $18.5 based on certain plans that have been put in place and some other things. But it’s probably in that $20 million number.
Richard Moore: And then Dan you know I noticed that percentage rents in the quarter took a pretty nice bounce up while regular base rents of course were coming down. And I’m curious, is any of that, I can’t imagine it has to do with sales being better, certainly not in this environment. Does any of that have to do with the co-tenancy clauses kicking in to percentage rent? Anything like that?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, it does. That’s exactly right. You know the difference between overage rent and percentage rent, that has more to do with co-tenancy provisions and the fact that as the base rent comes down but the tenant’s not paying us the base rent, they are in fact paying us the percentage rent or the alternative rent if you will. That’s not overage rent. It’s not a result of sales. You’re correct. It’s about co-tenancy.
William H. Schafer: Rich, that’s usually a one year change with respect to the co-tenancy provision in the leases. So you know if those tenants remain in occupancy a year from now, that’ll go back to base.
Richard Moore: And how would you guys assess that situation? I mean are we going to have more of that I guess?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It’s stabilized at this point in time. You know that is a result of primarily the bankruptcies and unless we see more significant bankruptcies, we don’t expect to have a large big box vacancy which would cause other tenants to go on percentage rent. So we think it’s stabilizing. It has dropped significantly from where we were a couple of quarters ago. And we don’t see it moving very much absent some negative impact on the sector like we had this time last year.
Richard Moore: Dave, you were saying that you’re getting capital availability from many sources and you don’t really need to do these extra secured loans. You might do them. I’m curious why you guys continue with the TALF program? I mean it can’t be a pleasant experience working with the government. I mean is there some particular reason why that’s still attractive to you?
David J. Oakes: I mean, I think our focus overall has been throughout this year to improve our liquidity and to lower our leverage and it hasn’t been about you know what was going to be necessarily the easiest or most pleasant for this company to execute. And so I think we’ve pursued you know all strategies, the various costs of capital, both in terms of coupon rates as well as in terms of how cumbersome they are and how much time they take to put together. So you know while some of them are certainly more challenging, you should assume that we are absolutely pushing as hard as possible in every direction to put as much capital as possible to insure that there’s no question of this company’s liquidity over the next several years.
Richard Moore: I hear what you’re saying. I mean the credit markets seem to me to be significantly more open than they were and why not take these 28 assets and just get mortgages on them?
Scott A. Wolstein: Rich, you know you’re not totally off base and yes, you know the advantages of the program aren’t necessarily what they were six months ago. But you know we’ll do whatever is best for the company in the long run. But yes you’re right in the sense that you’re observing that there are more opportunities now than there used to be.
Richard Moore: Are you sort of stuck with this, Scott? Could you actually get out of it if  you wanted to or are you sort of you know?
Scott A. Wolstein: No, we’re not stuck with it at all. We could get out of it if we chose to.
Richard Moore: Last thing guys on the credit lines, where are you with those you know given they’re due next year?
William H. Schafer: At this point you know the huge focus has been to you know prepare the balance sheet as much as possible to make that negotiation as strong as possible with the banks and to create as great a level of comfort as possible in terms of their overview of our credit. There’s also obviously been a major focus on working on other transactions and strengthening the relationship with our largest lenders to make sure that they are very aware of the importance of DDR as a good and recurring client. And so I think that’s where the focus has been. Today, given that we have you know 20 months until the maturities of our revolving credit facility, hasn’t been the appropriate time just yet to enter into formal negotiations regarding the extension of our credit line. There’s certainly informal conversations and work to insure that on a daily basis the bank group feels as comfortable as possible with their commitments to this company. With the recent capital that’s been raised there’s also been huge pay-downs of that revolving credit facility which was drawn roughly 90% of total capacity for a large portion of this year and it’s now more in the 60% range. So I think that’s a lot of capital coming back to those banks so I think we’ve sent them very important signals thus far. We continue to do that and would expect their renegotiation and the extension of our revolving credit facility to be a process that occurs in the first half of next year with firm results that we would expect to be able to report in the second half of next year, which is still going to be at minimum 6 but as much as 12 months before the maturity deadline.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Jeffrey Donnelly: I just wanted to follow up on something that I think Rich actually touched on. What has specifically been the pace of requests for rent and leased tenants? Have you seen any abatement there? And what about the pace in your granting those requests? I guess one final part of it is how are those renegotiated leases reflected in your same-store leasing metrics?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, renegotiated as a result of like a rent relief request or something like that may be granted but not reflected in our re-leasing efforts. They’re not in those numbers unless that tenant is at the end of its term and the lease has expired or the tenant then exercises its option. We reflect it exactly as it is so if the lease is expired it’s a new lease and if they exercise their option regardless of their rent then it’s in the renewal. As far as your question about rent reduction, first the velocity has slowed dramatically of requests coming onboard. Our total portfolio requests and keep in mind we have about 14,000 or 13,000 tenants, we had 953 total requests across the portfolio. And that is core and JV. The vast majority of them came from the southern region. 43% of those requests came from the southeast which is predominantly our grocery entered neighborhood center portfolio. We’ve granted 4.3% or 41 concessions of the 953. And the average concession that we granted was 22% off the base rent for a period of one year, and then the tenant converts back to its full rent. So that’s how the numbers break down. It’s pretty interesting to see where the requests are coming in and where they’re not coming in from, but suffice it to say the southern region is the one area that is showing the most distress.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Is that 953 requests cumulative to date?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes it is.
Jeffrey Donnelly: A question on bad debt, it’s certainly been accelerating I guess as the year moves forward. How should we think about that figure in Q4 or perhaps even Q1 if you’re able to speak to that? I guess I’m curious. Do you think we’re at a peak or near a peak?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it’s probably going to be somewhat consistent with where we’ve been operating these last couple of quarters. You’ll probably see more of it maybe into the Q1. I mean as typical cycles go. But it’s going to be probably averaging around maybe that 2% number.
Jeffrey Donnelly: You mentioned in the release that there might be some instances where [audio impairment] the commenced construction on development. I guess I’m curious. Can you share with us what sort of returns are penciling out there and I guess more broadly if you weren’t as far into those projects as you are today, would you consider commencing additional greenfield development in the near term?
Scott A. Wolstein: Domestically no. The returns available today in the domestic United States are not nearly sufficient to justify the investment of capital on the balance sheet. You know in terms of you know what’s the right strategy for the land that we own you know in the pipeline, you know when you look at the return, Jeff, you can look at it based on what you paid for the land or you can look at it you know based on you know what you could sell the land for. Or you could look at it based on you know what incremental income can you generate and what is the implied value of the land after you’ve developed the property. And that’s the kind of prism that we apply to each project to decide whether it makes sense to invest additional capital. You know I think that this is very consistent with all other developers, everybody’s facing the same issues, you know. And you know that’s in terms of sales of real estate assets, raw land will be the last thing where you’ll see a lot of velocity and transactions. So  you know it’s probably something that is a case by case analysis and you know to your question what kind of returns would be need to see? You know to justify new development I would say you know it’s our view it would have to be north of 12% and we’re not going to see that in the domestic U.S. for quite a while. Having said that down in Brazil we’re seeing returns as high as 17%, 18% on costs. So our Brazilian subsidiary will be an active developer.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And I’m just curious, just domestically if you could put some scale to it, I’m assuming that’s what you might be referring to in your release. I mean what sort of investment could you be making I guess in 2010 potentially for projects that are beginning construction?
Scott A. Wolstein: Probably less than we put in CapEx in 2009.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Shubar Mukardee] – Barclays Capital.
[Shubar Mukardee]: My question relates to the secured financing that you guys have secured from Goldman. Could you give us some sense of what the loan to value on that transaction is likely to be and what impact it would have on your unencumbered asset coverage ratio?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We pride ourselves on trying to be as transparent as possible and offering great disclosure as we’ve indicated before. We apologize that we cannot speak further regarding that transaction at this point.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions in the queue. This ends your presentation for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."
9,SITC,4,2009,2010-02-19 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q4 2009 Developers Diversified Realty Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Deanna and I’ll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) I’d now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Miss Kate Deck, Investor Relations Director. Please proceed.
Kate Deck: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call you’ll hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, David Oakes; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and filed with the SEC. In addition we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release dated February 18, 2010. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at ddr.com. Lastly, we will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time I’ll turn the call over to Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Kate. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. As Kate indicated, the participants on this call have changed as of late and I’d like to address the respective roles of the individuals that you will hear from today. In addition to my discussion of company philosophy, direction and goals for 2010, you will hear from Paul Freddo, our Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, who many on this call have either met during his tenure at DDR or during his 30 years at J.C. Penney. Paul will follow with his view of the leasing and the re-tenanting environment and we will conclude with David Oakes in his capacity as Chief Financial Officer. Also with us today is Christa Vesy, our Chief Accounting Officer, who is available to answer any accounting questions that you may have. But before I launch into the business, I think I would be remiss if I did not highlight the various management transitions that have occurred since we last spoke in this conference call format. First as we announced in November, Scott Wolstein and I have worked very closely over the past year to effectuate my transition to Chief Executive Officer and Scott’s transition to Executive Chairman. I am very pleased to report that such management change occurred as planned and both of us are embracing our new roles within the organization. Scott is working diligently with our board and me on numerous governance, international, strategic and industry wide matters while the senior management team and I satisfy the more traditional roles that our titles afford. Transitions are often not easy and I am extremely proud to say that Scott and I continue to value each other’s professional opinion, are working very well together and are friends. I am confident that the shareholders of DDR will benefit from our continued partnership in our new roles going forward. I admire Scott’s experience, intellect, value his input and have great respect for the footprint he leaves behind as our former CEO. I am also very grateful for the trust that he and the board have placed in me and the cooperative spirit maintained throughout the entire process, particularly during difficult times. And I am honored to oversee the future of our company and work so closely with our talented senior management team. As you also know, Bill Schaefer, our former CFO, departed our company on February 15. Bill served DDR with great dedication and integrity for nearly two decades and his accomplishments are many. While we mutually agreed that it was time for both DDR and Bill to move in different directions, Bill will always remain a valued friend of our company. In the interim, David Oakes assumed the role of CFO and oversaw the year end close to insure accuracy and a smooth transition. However, as we mentioned in yesterday evening’s press release, after an extensive national search for a new CFO and numerous meetings with well qualified candidates, it became patently obvious that the most qualified candidate for the job was David. Over the past 18 months David has developed and executed a restructuring strategy for our balance sheet, raised over $2 billion of capital, has emerged as an internal leader and is widely respected by the investing and lending communities. David’s background and experience on both the sell side and buy side, as well as his knowledge of the capital markets and ability to execute intricate transactions make him uniquely qualified to be the next CFO of this company. We had made a commitment to find the right individual to be a strong industry advocate and communicator of our corporate message and goals without compromising transparency or integrity, and David has proven that ability. I have valued my partnership with him as CIO and look forward to his continued prudent financial leadership in his role as CFO. In our continued effort to attract and retain high quality talent, a search for David’s successor as our Senior Investment Officer has commenced. Switching gears for a moment and getting back to the business, 2009 was a very active year for us as outlined in our January 12 press release. Operationally I am pleased with our leasing and portfolio management results with quarterly increases in our portfolio leased rate and a record setting year for leasing velocity and deal volume. On the capital raising front, we executed upon a strategy of improving liquidity and lowering leverage to prudent and strategic capital raises. We have consistently stated that there are many ways to achieve our de-leveraging objectives, and as a result we access capital from a variety of different sources and de-levered our balance sheet by $700 million in 2009. Before turning the call over to Paul, I would like to address our recent equity offering, which allowed us to raise $338 million of net proceeds at $8.16 per share including the shoe. Despite its high cost, adding common equity to our balance sheet has always been part of our plan and we believe our recent equity offering was integral to our de-leveraging and liquidity enhancing initiatives. We have continually tried to strike an appropriate balance between reducing our balance sheet risk and diluting our current shareholders. However, we believe our primary focus in this environment should be on lowering our long-term cost of capital and we feel the recent offering will accomplish just that over time. I will now turn the call over to Paul who will discuss portfolio operations and the retail environment. Paul?
Paul Freddo: Thanks Dan. It is a pleasure to join the earnings call and I look forward to continuing to communicate with many of you in the future regarding our leasing and operating platforms. I’d like to begin with an update on the retail environment which is still challenged but showing signs of improvement. The 2009 holiday season resulted in better than expected top and bottom line performance for many retailers, providing positive momentum going into 2010. Retailers have proven they can operate in the current environment, improving margins through inventory and expense control. Now they need to follow that up with sustained top line and earnings growth. Encouragingly, the momentum most of our retailers are experiencing has shifted the conversations away from damage control to the topic of growth and how they are going to achieve it. While the reduction in consumer credit and stubbornly high unemployment continue to be impediments to maintaining this momentum, retailers are buoyed by what they see as the consumer gaining clarity over their job and financial situation. As a result, while we continue to see retailers maintain many of the defensive strategies adopted in the past 18 months, most view 2010 as an important year for gaining market share. While retailers remain cautious, the improved environment is providing them with more visibility over their sales and their growth plans. The value oriented retailers that comprise the majority of our portfolio continue to win as their value proposition became even more relevant to their core customers, as well as to a new segment of consumers who are looking to trade down in price but not in value. Turning to operations, deal velocity remained strong in the fourth quarter. We completed 166 new deals representing 1.1 million square feet and 306 renewals for 1.9 million square feet. In total we executed 472 deals during the fourth quarter, representing 3 million square feet. For the year we signed 1,662 deals representing 10.6 million square feet, comprised of 583 new leases for 3.3 million square feet and 1,079 renewals for 7.3 million square feet. On our second quarter call, Dan outlined our leased rate outlook for 2009, stating that we had seen a trough in the lease rate at 90.7% and were expecting gradual increases for the balance of the year. This set the bar high for our leasing team as tenant fallout had offset the new leases executed in the first half of the year. Strong leasing activity in the third and fourth quarters resulted in a 20 basis point improvement in the third quarter and a 30 basis point improvement in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 91.2% leased occupancy rate at the end of 2009. Based upon our current level of activity and our proven ability to execute, we expect to improve the core portfolio leased rate to over 92% by the end of 2010. While the leasing volume for the beginning of the year is in line with our expectations, the seasonal nature of tenant fallout in the first and second quarters could make occupancy gains lumpy in the first half of the year, but we are confident we will achieve our goal by year end. Leasing spreads for the fourth quarter and the year were challenged. While we remained relatively flat on renewal spreads for the quarter and the year, re-tenanting space vacated by bankrupt retailers continued to negatively impact new deal spreads. Our spread on re-tenanting bankrupt boxes was negative 21.6% while our spread excluding these boxes was negative 12.1%. When combined with flat renewal spreads, which we see as a victory in this environment, our overall spreads were negative 4.6 in the quarter and negative 3.4 for the year, exactly on target with our expectations. While retailers continue to drive tough economic deals, we are beginning to see some competition for space and accordingly expect spreads for new deals to improve modestly throughout the year but to remain negative. Spreads on renewals will remain under pressure as retailers are starting to renegotiate their renewals earlier in an attempt to lock in current rates, and as a result we expect renewal spreads to remain flat in 2010. One other point to be aware of when considering new leasing spreads is that our calculations only include new leases signed on spaces which have been vacant for less than one year. In other words, if a space is leased which had been vacant for more than one year those deal economics are not included in our spread calculation, but the new lease income is included in the estimated revenue impact. With regard to backfilling big box vacancies, our Lancaster redevelopment team continued to make substantial progress in the fourth quarter, leasing 15 units for over 500,000 square feet and selling two former Mervyn’s containing 136,000 square feet. We continued to make deals with many of today’s active retailers including Kohl’s; TJX; Bed Bath & Beyond; Best Buy; PetSmart; Nordstrom Rack; Jo-Ann; and hhgregg. In 2009, 49 leases were executed on the vacant junior anchor space representing over 1.6 million square feet. Of the 6.9 million square feet of space re-termed through the five major bankruptcies, we have some level of activity on 58% of the space, including 24% leased or sold and 34% in LOI or lease negotiations. One area that continues to mitigate revenue pressure is our renovative ancillary income initiatives which continue to augment earnings each year. Revenues from sponsorship, advertising, temporary and seasonal inline leasing and emerging areas such as solar panels have increased 23% over the prior year, resulting in $34.7 million of total portfolio income for 2009. We are budgeting to increase revenues by another 17% this year, which is partially attributable to new opportunities for business development in Brazil, including Pay for Parking at our centers and a general ramping up of the ancillary income program across the entire Brazilian portfolio. In regard to development, we continue to minimize development spending in the domestic portfolio, with the majority of the caps being allocated to the lease up of existing development and re-development projects. We do, however, see continued opportunity for growth in Brazil. The Brazilian economy and specifically our portfolio continue to perform with thanks to our NOI growth of 9.4% during the quarter and 11.2% for the year. The portfolio leased rate remains a healthy 97% and the new mall in Manaus that opened at 96% leased in April of 2009 continues to see strong sales growth. As an indication of our enthusiasm and potential for the Brazilian portfolio, Richard Brown, our Executive Vice President of International, recently relocated to Brazil to oversee operations and new business opportunities there. In summary, we are pleased with the progress we made in 2009 and are encouraged by the improvement and momentum we see in the retail environment. That said, we recognize that there is much to be done in continuing to lease up our portfolio and we will continue to operate in a very realistic manner. I’ll now turn the call over to David.
David J. Oakes: Thanks Paul. I’ll begin by talking very briefly about the de-leveraging and liquidity progress that we have made in 2009 and thus far in 2010, discuss our operating results and then move on to our goals and plans for the rest of this year. With an intense focus on a very broad array of capital sources, we raised over $2 billion of capital in the past year through asset sales, new debt capital, new equity capital and retained earnings. As a result, we reduced total consolidated debt to approximately $5.2 billion at year end 2009, a $700 million reduction from year end 2008. We lowered pro rata debt to EBITDA to 9.5 times for the fourth quarter, a significant improvement from its peak of 10.2 times just two quarters before. In addition, we significantly improved our liquidity position. At year end, there was $530 million available on our revolving credit facilities and today there is over $800 million available. We also improved our covenant metrics as a result of our de-leveraging activities. We remained compliant with all of our covenants throughout the trough of the cycle and we expect to see continued improvement going forward. We will operate with greater cushion relative to our covenant in all future periods, driven by continued de-leveraging activities as well as a return to historic occupancy norms that we expect to achieve over the next several years. Turning now to our quarterly and annual financial results, operating FFO was $0.31 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.83 per share for the year. Including certain non-operating and primarily non-cash charges, FFO was a loss of $0.14 per share for the fourth quarter and a loss of $0.90 per share for the year. The quarterly results once again contain many non-operating gains and losses that we believe skew the true performance of this company. These items aggregate to negative $91 million and include several impairments, particularly related to JV development as well as gains on bond repurchases and a gain related to our redemption from the large joint venture with MDT. These operating and non-operating results are consistent with the guidance we provided in our press release last month. Our outlook for 2010 that was also announced last month remains consistent and we are pleased that we could address much of the uncertainty that existed regarding our balance sheet targets through the equity offering that we completed last week. The equity offering was a crucial step in continuing our de-leveraging strategy. The offering helped raise approximately $338 million of net proceeds, which was used immediately to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facilities in anticipation of repaying two series of unsecured notes that mature in May and August of this year and an additional secured and unsecured mortgage debt that matures in the near future. We believe that this offering was appropriately sized to achieve our de-leveraging goals without unduly diluting current shareholders. And we were extremely pleased by the positive response the offering received from the investment community. As mentioned earlier with over $800 million in available capacity on our revolving credit facility and only $350 million of fully owned maturing debt left to address in 2010, our liquidity profile is sufficient to carry us through several years even if no other capital initiatives are undertaken. Prior to last weeks’ equity offering we had also used our continuous equity program to raise an additional $45 million of capital in January that has also been used to retire debt. This program has served us well as an efficient means to lower leverage over the past year-and-a-half, but we do not expect to continue to use this tool during the remainder of 2010. As Dan mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very conscious of the high cost of common equity and we will continue to actively look at other sources of capital to lower leverage and further improve liquidity. First, we are planning to generate $150 million from asset sales in 2010, which is DDR’s share net of any mortgage debt repaid. We have generated approximately $26 million in net proceeds from asset sales so far this year, and we currently have over $500 million under contract for sale, a majority of which are JV assets. Only a portion of those proceeds would come to us. We have additional assets under letter of intent currently and we remain comfortable with our target of $150 million. In addition to the liquidity they generate, sales of non-prime assets also have the important benefit of improving our portfolio quality. Second, we expect to generate an excess of $200 million of retained capital in 2010, which is net of the low cash dividend that we expect to pay this year. The board will continue to assess the dividend policy on a quarterly basis, and we expect the dividend will be paid at the minimum level required to maintain REIT status for the remainder of 2010, a calculation that is reduced this year by certain asset sale losses. Third, we will continue to look for ways to retire debt, particularly near term maturities, at a discount to par through negotiated transactions and select open market repurchases. In 2010 to date we have repurchased approximately $63 million of 2010, ’11 and ’12 notes for $59 million, or a 6% discount to par. As always, we will continue to evaluate other capital sources and opportunistically transact. The availability of new capital at terms that make sense for our balance sheet and our debt maturity profile has improved dramatically from one year ago, and significantly even relative to a few months ago. We believe that the equity offering we completed last week was an integral part of our de-leveraging and liquidity enhancing initiatives, and we will continue to evaluate all of our options to further improve liquidity, extend our average debt duration and de-lever, as we remain keenly focused on lowering our long-term cost of capital. To date there is roughly $350 million of wholly owned debt maturing in 2010, excluding debt with borrower extension options, which includes roughly $325 million of unsecured notes and approximately $25 million of remaining mortgage maturities. There are also two consolidated JV mortgage maturities in 2010. The large maturity is a $225 million note maturing in October with a 50-50 joint venture with Macquarie DDR Trust, secured by a portfolio of former Mervyn stores. We are in active discussions with representatives of the lenders now and believe that we will achieve a relatively attractive outcome for our shareholders. We have $740 million of unconsolidated joint venture debt maturing in 2010, excluding debt with borrower extension options, of which DDR shares $235 million. We are underway on the refinancing of many of these loans and lender interest has been solid. Our joint venture debt has been significantly reduced relative to prior quarters by a redemption from the MDT-USLOC joint venture. As many of you are aware, our revolving credit facilities have their initial maturity this June and have a one year extension at our option that we intend to exercise. We are currently in discussions with 30 banks that participate in the revolvers in addition to several banks that are not current participants but have expressed interest in joining. It is important to note that we believe we have excellent relationships with our [line] banks which are only enhanced by our recent activities, including the recent equity offering. Over the next several months we will be negotiating terms for the new revolver, hosting a bank meeting and working through the process with our close relationships. We expect to complete the refinancing in the second half of 2010 as a smaller company that will be much more disciplined in the acquisitions. We are choosing to right-size the new facility and are targeting a size approximately 25% below the existing capacity. We are encouraged by the feedback in the early steps of this process, as well as the overall tone from a larger group of lenders looking to extend or originate loans. However, there is much work to be done and we will update you as additional progress is made. We remain very focused on earning our way back to a consensus view that we have an investment grade balance sheet. We have articulated and continue to execute upon a thoughtful plan to improve our credit metric, and we have received very positive feedback from lenders and fixed income investors, but we still have progress to make with several of the major rating agencies. As we continue to execute upon our plan, we will insure that this improvement is evident to all constituencies. This will be another busy and challenging year for us as we continue to improve upon our balance sheet and we will keep you updated on our progress on the earnings call, as well as at conferences and with presentations posted to the IR section of our website. 2010 is by no means the end of the story, as more work will be needed in coming years to reach the appropriate debt levels for this company, which should result in a much lower cost of capital for this company. While we don’t know exactly when we’ll get there, we will continue to be as transparent as possible along the way to help you understand the progress we are making. I’d like to wrap up by saying that I’m honored by the appointment to Chief Financial Officer and excited by the opportunity to take even greater responsibility within this high quality organization. We have made great strides during the past year, particularly related to strengthening our balance sheet, and I am very enthusiastic about our opportunities to continue to improve and to generate strong shareholder returns with a reduced risk profile. I’ll now turn the call over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. In recent months I’ve often been asked what will be different at the company going forward? And I’d like to take a moment to discuss the philosophical changes that our management team, Board of Directors and employees envision for this company. First, we will no longer grow our company through large portfolio acquisitions, but rather we will focus on developing and growing our prime portfolio through prudent and strategic transactions. Second, we will keenly focus on balance sheet strategy. This includes a disciplined focus on structuring our debt maturity schedule such that refinancing risk is mitigated, accessing a variety of financing sources such that our capital structure is healthy, and viewing EBITDA as a primary metric for success. Accordingly, our target leverage metric will be pro rata debt to EBITDA, with an overall leverage goal of approximately 6.5 to 7.5 times EBITDA, and work prudently to maintain investment grade credit ratings. Third, we will evaluate all investment opportunities in such a way that EBITDA accretion is not the only consideration, but also the potential impact on our operating platform and net asset value per share. Fourth, our international portfolio, specifically Brazil and Puerto Rico, will continue to be sources of above average growth and portfolio diversification. Lastly and perhaps most importantly, we will continue to invest and develop our human capital to drive innovation and success. Most of the changes we are making represent a fundamental shift at DDR, and I look forward to reporting the results of our strategic plan going forward. At this time we’d be happy to take your questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Christy McElroy – UBS.
Christy McElroy: David, just wanted to follow up on your comments on dividend policy, thinking about it in the context of taxable income and potential asset sales. Can you provide some color on what assets you’re looking to sell specifically this year and does your $200 million routine cash flow estimate reflect keeping the cash dividend at $0.02 per quarter?
David J. Oakes: We’ve got a portfolio management strategy that results in a majority of our portfolio being considered our prime portfolio. The assets that fall outside of that would almost all generally be at least considered for sale at some point as we look to continue to focus on the prime assets, so the assets that we are looking to sell continue to be and have an overwhelming focus on the non-prime assets. Some of those assets do have losses that would result from a sale and we believe that, based on the transactional activity that we’re looking at today, that we should be able to maintain the dividend at a low cash level. As we said it will be something that the board has to make a decision about each quarter, but we don’t think taxable income will be a major driver for pushing the dividend higher, as we think there will be enough items that allow us to keep the cash dividend at a very low level. And that is what is implicit in our guidance for retained earnings in excess of $200 million for this year.
Christy McElroy: And then just sort of following up on that, I’m wondering if you could comment on your land held for development? Many of your peers have written down their land balances. You’ve talked about selling a portion of your land for the holding period would be pretty short on some of that. Can you walk us through the logic behind why it wouldn’t be written down at this point? And in your estimation, what do you think the land is worth today versus what it’s on the books for?
David J. Oakes: We obviously have to go through this process on a very regular basis, particularly related to the fourth quarter annual close. And so we obviously stand by the values that exist on the balance sheet. The analysis for [ups] for wholly owned land is not simply where we could liquidate that land today. That was not our intent in buying that land and it is not our stated intent today. I think we’re going to be very thoughtful with whether it makes sense to invest additional capital or whether it makes sense to sell certain land parcels. So we’re certainly considering all alternatives, but from the standpoint of an opportunity to develop this land, we do believe that the $850 million balance that includes both land as well as construction in progress on the balance sheet is very justifiable. If forced to liquidate that land today, I think some of that land would be valued at higher than the book value and I think there’s potentially much of that land that would receive a market price today if forced to sell that would be lower than that book value. But overall, with our plans to potentially develop some of it over a long period of time, and certainly consider the sale of some of it but over some period of time, we think the valuation is justifiable. I think it’s important to note also that given the nature of our land and given the cost basis and given the progress that has been made in many cases on the entitlement side, it is the case that this land has actually been improved over the course of the period we’ve owned it. And also when you think about the potential list of buyers for development land, it is not exclusively a process of us looking for opportunity funds or other investors that would require a very high return on that land. It may also be, in some cases, our ability to sell portions to some of the major anchor tenants that continue to be very, very profitable and as Paul mentioned, you know, are beginning in earnest to look for ways to grow in the out years. So if you look at entities there that have a very different cost of capital than potential other competing developers, so I think we view the $850 million on the balance sheet as a reasonable number. We think it is an opportunity for us over the next several years to either get some of that currently non-income producing land as either cash flowing or in some cases the potential to sell some of that land and monetize it that way. At this point we are not capitalizing interest or real estate taxes or other expense on a large portion of that land held for development. So that is hitting the operating statement right now and we think either way, whether it is developing centers and getting that land cash flowing or in certain cases liquidating land, that there would be an ability to improve the results as they show up today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Paul Morgan - Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Paul Morgan: There’s been some discussion on about cap rate compression for what you would characterize as non-prime assets this earnings season. I just wondered whether you could comment on what you’re seeing for that, sort of given the lack of A quality products in the market, reducing more interest in the category of assets, where cap rates might [inaudible] for that.
David J. Oakes: We have certainly seen some improvement in the transactional markets, certainly relative to 12 months ago at this time when there was [inaudible] little activity and when skepticism regarding our ability to achieve the $200 million of sales that we achieved last year was very high. The markets have become somewhat more [inaudible] driven simply by a world that’s a little easier to underwrite at this point in terms of go forward expectations and some of it because the lending environment has improved somewhat, not for very high value loans but for loans that are going to have a reasonable amount of equity in front of them. There is an ability to borrow against new product. Responsible people are not underwriting [inaudible] on an un-levered basis. I think some of it is simply the fact that there were very few transactions last year and some of it does relate to some direct cap rate compression. I think the recent market comps have certainly indicated the prime assets are trading below 8% and in many cases or most cases even from what we’ve seen, well below 8%. And that the non-prime assets that were selling have compressed a little bit from an average 9.5% or so level last year to some [inaudible] maybe in the low 9% level. You know we would continue to [inaudible] the fact that we are selling assets with a little more hair on them, assets that we believe the NOI growth profile may be challenged for several years and so the cap rates for what we’re transacting in are still above 9. But that market has certainly improved somewhat just over the past few months as the availability of debt capital has improved.
Paul Morgan: If that trend continues in the first half of this year, say, do you think it’s possible that you could exceed your expectations for?
David J. Oakes: It’s certainly something we would consider. Per the comments earlier, you know, we’re very focused on the quality of this portfolio and we’re very focused on our long-term cost of capital. We do believe that the considerable number of non-prime assets, even though they aggregate to a very small portion of our NOI stream overall, do have a disproportionately negative effect on the perception of the portfolio. So I think from that standpoint it could certainly make sense, as well as from a financial standpoint, [inaudible] once the cost of capital of selling those assets versus other alternatives. So at this point guidance is for $150 million of proceeds and we’ll update you as the year progresses on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carol Kemple - Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: Then I had one question. On the guidance that came out in January it was for FFO of $1.05 to $1.15. Was the offering a little larger than you all expected and will that lower guidance?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The offering was the size as we expected. It just came a little earlier in the cycle than we had anticipated, but in our numbers we did anticipate an offering of that size.
Carol Kemple: What average interest rate are you all expecting for the year?
David J. Oakes: The interest rate on our debt is locked through the year. The important variable portion of that relates to the line of credit. And the term loan, a small amount of that is hedged but most of that is actually floating. That level of variable debt is much smaller today than it has been as we’ve been paying down the line of credit. But we still do have some exposure to variable rate debt and as we look out through the year, we’re just looking at the forward LIBOR curve. We’re not sitting around making any sort of interest rate bet, simply what the market is telling us. So increasing LIBOR throughout the course of the year from the close to zero or roughly 25 basis points today accelerating to around 1% by year end.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Habermann - Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: David, you mentioned the goal of reducing debt to EBITDA closer to the 6.5 times to 7.5 times range. Can you give us a sense of the timing? I mean given your increased focus on obviously improving the balance sheet and working with the rating agencies.
David J. Oakes: Yes. I think we’ve been very careful to try to balance the significant improvements we’re making with not doing anything overly drastic that would have an undue negative impact on our near term or immediate term cost of capital. As we look out over the next few years, you have a number of levers that are in our favor for leverage reduction. An important part of it, as is the case this year but probably a little less in the future, is required dividend payments will probably be higher, will be a consistent amount of significant retained cash flow that can be used for leverage reduction. Secondly, while we haven’t seen it show up in financial results in a big way over the past year, we have seen it show up very significantly in the leasing volumes, just not all those leases have had their rent commencement dates. So we do think that there’s an ability to improve the EBITDA number. So not just the simple process of how do we reduce debt but we actually think that there’s a strong case to be made that we can return to historic levels. I mean where this portfolio operated for a very, very long period of time, we think we can return to those sort of levels and increase EBITDA because of that. This space goes from modest negative cash flow today to even the below historic norm rents that Paul mentioned we’re achieving on a considerable volume of activity today. So we think there’s an opportunity to increase EBITDA there. We think there’s an opportunity with the $850 million of construction in progress and land held for development on our balance sheet, where some of that will become cash flowing over time, even if that’s at a lower than pro forma yield. That can be helpful for the EBITDA growth over time. And then finally, you know we continue to look to asset sales for both their help on the portfolio management side and improving the quality of this portfolio, but also for their help on the de-leveraging side where we have been able to eliminate a considerable amount of debt there. So you know we don’t want to get tied down to an exact schedule of exactly how each one of these pieces is going to play out. We think we’ve laid out the plan. We think we’ve executed very well on that plan over the past year or so, and we firmly expect to continue to do that and update you as each piece of that is put in place as we move closer and closer to those leverage targets over the next couple of years.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You know, Jay, one of the things we’ve talked about last quarter and the quarter before was the timing of when this leasing is going to hit from an income perspective and I do think it’s important to remind everyone that even though we did 10.5 million feet of leasing, over 10.5 million feet of leasing in 2009, a small portion of that will hit in 2010. And an even smaller portion will hit for full year. Almost none will hit for full year 2010. So most of the leasing that you’re hearing about in the numbers will be full year numbers in 2011. And that will have a material impact on our EBITDA number as David mentioned. So as leasing velocity continues, and hopefully it will continue through the year, the deals that were done in ‘9 should be fully annualized in ’11 and the deals that are done in ’10 should be fully annualized in ’12, but you have portions of each one of those years that can have a positive impact in the prior year.
Jonathan Habermann: And then in terms of the JV financing this year, you mentioned $741 million, your share roughly $275. Can you give us some sense of the debt yield there? Will you need to put more equity in or actually pay down some of that debt? And have you made an allocation for that in your assumptions for the full year?
David J. Oakes: When we look at the JV debt that’s maturing this year, monies in general higher loan to value than our consolidated debt, more conscious of that. In our liquidity planning we have certainly budgeted for some re-equitization of those joint ventures where they are prime assets that we expect to have a long-term ownership of. It has not been our recent experience that that equity has actually been required, as lenders have been willing to extend it at current terms. Over the past year those extensions were very typically one year extensions. As we talk to lenders or representatives of lenders today, it’s much more possible that those extensions could be multi-year extensions. So while we have budgeted in our own liquidity plan for a potential requirement of additional capital there, we haven’t experienced that. And as we progress through this year, I think there’s a lot of loans that can and will be replaced with new long-term debt at their current level of proceeds. There are some that will be extended and there are certainly some that would require some equity, if we don’t move on a sale of some of those assets. That’s also why you see a considerable volume of the assets that are on the contract for sale right now are joint venture assets and some of them relate to situations exactly like that. Where as opposed to it being our equity, it may represent someone else’s equity coming in. We also continue to very actively look for new institutional capital to recapitalize certain ventures, and most of those calls are incoming calls as institutional capital is looking for some of those opportunities, where we might be able to find new partners to contribute some or all of the equity required to extend the duration of the joint venture loan book.
Jonathan Habermann: And just to be clear with those multi-year extensions, are you assuming the same rate or does the rate increase?
David J. Oakes: In a great majority of cases those are at a comparable rate. Some up front fees paid that obviously is amortized over those couple of years, but generally at a comparable rate to what is in place today.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Dan, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned on this call or other participants have mentioned as well, about the ability to get back to a historical 94% or 95% occupancy levels to where this portfolio had been for a long time. I mean as you think about potential structural changes in the big box retail world that obviously have impacted and you think about the supply that has been added over the last few years, certainly in the housing boom, and you look at retailers that are going smaller format rather than some of the larger formats that they’ve done, I guess what confidence do you have of the industry and then DDR specifically about really attaining back to those historical occupancy levels?
Paul Freddo: Michael, this is Paul. We’re confident but it’s going to be a several year process and I think as Dave had mentioned, you know, we don’t expect to get back to those historical norms for several years. And as we indicated with the guidance only getting to 92% over the course of 2010. You know a lot of things are working for us in terms of what you described with the retailers, downsizing or reducing their format, that’s good news for a lot of our vacant space. You know we’ve got a lot of our junior anchor boxes we talked about are in that 20,000 to 50,000 foot range and we’re seeing guys downsize that are fitting nicely into that size. You know we also continue to see a lack for a diminishing of quality supply. You know we all know that there’s no additional supply coming on the market and we are very aware that these retailers continue to need to grow. You know they’ve been selective in the deals they’ve made in 2009. They will continue to be. But every meeting, every conversation we have with the folks that are filling that space, there is still a need to grow and that’s not going to go away in the foreseeable future. So we have this few year period where we’re confident we can get there just through meeting the demand needs of the retail universe.
Michael Bilerman: And I guess when you look at the lease numbers of 91% and 89%, if you include the Mervyn, can you talk through just to really understand this EBITDA potential? You know, where are you today from a occupancy perspective, rent paying? And then what percentage of that may be dark but rent paying? And at the end of the year, was there any sort of temporary bump that you had in those numbers? And I think, Dan, you talked a little bit about the fact that you have done a substantial amount of leasing but that leasing is not going to become occupied until 2011, so maybe you can just walk us through sort of the current cash flow perspective and where we can go.
Paul Freddo: Let me first touch on the dark percentage. That’s somewhere in the 10 to 15% of our vacancy right now, Michael. But just so you know we are out there leasing that as if it’s vacant. It is counted in our lease occupancy rate as still paying rent, but we are aggressively looking to replace those dark retailers as soon as possible.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: On the EBITDA side, Mike, when we look at what it would take for us to get back to that 95% occupied, because as you correctly point out we’re going to lose some space in this whole turnover as tenants downsize and there will be some square footage mothballed as a result of that. That could be very positive. That could create opportunities for us to relocate more marketable retail space elsewhere on the site. For example, getting rid of the back of the depth of certain boxes and putting out parcels in parking lots that are very, very profitable for us. But we are going to probably be a stabilized company at about 95% versus that 96%, 96.5%. To get us back to 95% using very conservative numbers, we feel there’s an additional $30 to $35 million of EBITDA that we will pick up in that transaction over time. The market will tell us how quickly that will happen and the market will also tell us what the rents will be, but just figuring from our past experience this past year in 2009, we’re pretty comfortable that the additional pick up that we will see on the revenue side, as a result of getting back to historic norms, will be somewhere between $30 to $40 million, depending on which cycle we’re in in the leasing environment.
Michael Bilerman: And then just to answer the specific in terms of what is rent paying occupancy today and as a percentage of that, how much of that is dark but rent paying? Because the 91% is a lease percentage, right?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That’s correct.
Paul Freddo: Right. Currently occupied is about 88%, almost 89%, Michael. Which is a much greater spread than we’ve historically had but we view it as positive obviously. Historically we were in that 50 to 60 basis point spread between leased, occupancy and occupied. Today obviously with the big hit, with the five major bankruptcies and the volume of activity, to have 250 basis point spread between leased and occupied is all potential upside for us.
Michael Bilerman: And then of that 89%, how much is dark but rent paying?
Paul Freddo: Well again the vacancies about 10%.
Michael Bilerman: And just a quick follow up, just to make sure I got the debt EBITDA correct. Pro forma for the equity offering you’re down to about 8.4 and a 9 on the see through basis. And I guess pro forma for the free cash flow retention in this year, you get to call it 8 consolidated and 8.5 see through. Assuming you don’t do anything else in terms of selling non-income producing asset land development, other equity raise transactions, is that correct?
Paul Freddo: Yes. We believe just by the activity that we’ve completed over the first couple of quarters as well as the retained capital that you mentioned that a large portion of the work is done to achieve that mid 8 times range on pro rata debt to EBITDA.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Wigginton - Macquarie Research Equities.
David Wigginton: I wanted to actually ask a quick question on the Mervyn box loan, David, that you touched on that’s coming due this year. I think you mentioned that you were anticipating an attractive outcome for shareholders. Could you maybe just talk a little about the details there and on I guess the flip side of that, why would you not just consider handing back the keys on those boxes at this point and realizing the benefit from I guess the drag on FFO that you’re experiencing right now as a result of this?
David J. Oakes: Well, you know, I’d stress the fact that we are in active discussions today and this is an important issue and so we can’t necessarily be as transparent right now as we will be long-term. We recognize very much what you’re saying that currently we have negative NOI from that portfolio. We’re even more negative on cash flow because of the interest expense that’s flowing through our results and for a simple NAV calculation of this company, it would result in a negative valuation coming from the Mervyn’s asset, when in reality due to the nature of non-recourse debt, that valuation cannot be negative. So I guess all we can really say right now is that we are very cognizant of all the issues and we’re working with representatives of the lender for a solution that will work for us as well as for them.
David Wigginton: So is the handing back of the keys still a viable alternative in the event you can’t work out an attractive deal for DDR on the workout side or on the extension side?
David J. Oakes: It’s certainly something that we would actively consider. We do have this portfolio secured by both the Mervyn boxes as well as a pool of cash that was the letter of credit that we were originally given by the seller of the Mervyn boxes to us, so the lender has some flexibility there to use that cash flow to continue to service the loan, as they gave us two separate pieces of collateral. But we are working through that process today. And we’ve had, as Paul mentioned, good interest in many of those boxes from a leasing side but obviously until we have anything figured out with the lender, the finalization activity has to be slow there simply because we obviously could not put capital into those boxes when we don’t have clarity about the long-term outcome there. So progress has been slower than we would like, but we continue to advance those discussions.
David Wigginton: Can you just remind us what the drag on that FFO is from those boxes?
David J. Oakes: Yes. In round numbers you’re talking about at the NOI level in the $2 million range and noting that that’s consolidated, so that’s showing up in our top line results, not coming through the joint venture. And then a portion of that gets backed out through the minority interest line. And then the interest expense on the roughly $225 million of debt today is an average right around 5% cost, so you’ve got another $10 million or north of $10 million of interest expense that’s showing up. Again, 100% of it shows up on our books even though 50% of it is ours economically. So you’ve got you know $12 million roughly in total that’s showing up as a drag on our results from that portfolio.
David Wigginton: With respect to your Brazilian and Puerto Rican portfolios, those obviously have been performing quite strongly. And also recognizing that you’re de-leveraging I guess Mode at this point, what’s the likelihood of you investing more capital in those two markets given the high growth potential there?
Paul Freddo: Well, we are looking at various capital sources to invest more capital to facilitate additional growth, particularly in Brazil where there’s development opportunity at very attractive returns. We do not intend to export capital from the U.S. to support that operation. We view that operation as a self sufficient operation that has the ability to raise capital on its own through a variety of different sources and we’re investigating what all those are. With regard to Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico does not really have a development opportunity. It has some redevelopment opportunity and some expansion opportunity, but the capital required to facilitate that program is really nominal. Development in Puerto Rico has really stopped and came to a standstill many, many years ago because the barriers to entry there are so high and the entitlement process so difficult. So unlike Brazil, new projects and new initiatives in Puerto Rico are few and far between other than maximizing the value that you have out of your current assets. In Brazil where there’s obviously enormous interest from a variety of different retailers and a vastly under stored country, we have the ability to take advantage of our infrastructure that we have down there.
David Wigginton: Do you have specific opportunities identified in Brazil at this point?
Paul Freddo: We do. As you know we mentioned we opened a center this April. We have broken ground on another new center just recently and we commenced two redevelopment projects as well. There are other green field sites that we are looking at in Brazil and we would like very much to be able to do one new project and one redevelopment or perhaps two projects on an annualized basis. We can’t specifically talk about exactly where they are because there are competitive forces at work in Brazil, but we feel very, very good about the program and we’re working very closely with Wal-Mart who has a very aggressive approach towards Brazil right now. And the reaction ha been very positive.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nick Vedder - Green Street Advisors.
Nick Vedder: I just want a point of clarification. I think in the prepared remarks I heard that the expectation is that your leasing spreads improve next year on new deals as opposed to. Is that correct?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, Nick.
Nick Vedder: I’m just thinking about that and if you can expand on that a bit just in terms of you know you made considerable progress on the lease up of junior anchor space and just looking forward I would imagine that the space that is yet to be leased is going to be a little bit more difficult to try and attract tenants. So I just wanted to a get a little bit more info on the re-leasing spread and how you’re thinking about that.
Paul Freddo: There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on out there and you know we talked earlier about the reduction in supply and the quality supply. The absorption of space that has occurred today, Nick, is also working for us. You know a lot of people have asked us about well the best has gone quickly and now you’re left with just the dregs. And that’s not necessarily the case. In fact we have some examples of space that last year certain retailers passed on but this year they have come back and expressed interest in. And again keep in mind they need to continue to fill their expansion pipeline. You know I think as we look at the spreads and that whole conversation, you know last year the environment was lousy; we all got it; we all had a lot of vacancy and we had to address it. And that’s what we did. This year again is a little bit different dynamic out there. We are seeing increased competition, we are actually seeing some of the retailers increase their needs to expand. And so the little different dynamic is the ability to test the market this year and drive a little higher rent and we are seeing that early in the year. It’s not substantial. You know we’re not seeing $10 deals become $15 deals, but the slightest incremental gain is positive obviously and that’s what we’re seeing. And we anticipate that that will continue to improve. But again I think an important point to remember is just that as space gets absorbed, you might have had the second or third best box in a market last year, you may be the only box left this year and we’re starting to see activity on stuff and that’s been a very pleasant surprise in that regard.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Some of this, Nick, is also really just the math of it because in our spreads we don’t include spaces that have been vacant over a year. So on a comparative basis, a lot of these boxes that are vacant have been vacant for a year and will come out of that calculation. So we’re really talking about spreads over previous spreads from the prior year, not going back beyond that. So the comp will also be easier for us to be quite honest and we should be able to show improvement as a result. So we’re not really comparing a vacant Linens box that’s been vacant for 18 months and was paying $24 to a new deal that’s paying $12, because if it’s been vacant for over a year it’s not included in the calculation.
Nick Vedder: It looked like on your top tenant list, some of the wholly owned space had become un-owned space and I’m just curious, was that due to the sale of some anchor boxes and how do you think about that and the long-term impact on a center versus the control of the center? And then also will you balance that with your need for liquidity?
David J. Oakes: We did sell some boxes back to tenants this year. You know, as we were in the midst of 2009 there was an extraordinary difference in cost of capital between us and our top tenants. And you know we thought that that was something that didn’t make sense for either side and we could come to an agreement on pricing that generated capital at an attractive relative price for us, given what we could do with it. We don’t take lightly giving up control of our centers. Most of these sort of situations were actually sort of freestanding anchor stores that were not part of a bigger center. So some of them were, but there were a number of situations where they were freestanding stores that came to us as part of the single tenant portfolio that was included in the England acquisition. So we got a number of freestanding anchors from that situation and so that’s part of it. It’s also going to be impacted by the redemption out of the MDT joint venture, where we no longer have an ownership interest in the largest portion of MDT. So we can lease and manage and have a close relationship and oversight of MDT but we no longer have an ownership interest, even at the 15% level that we had had in those spots. So there are a few items there that impacted those results over the past year, but we obviously maintain great focus on owning and controlling a high quality portfolio and trying to make the right long-term decisions to lower our leverage and improve liquidity and not simply just de-leverage the most saleable to try to come up with a short term solution for the issues that were at hand.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Mueller - J.P. Morgan.
Michael Mueller: A couple of other leasing questions, first of all, on the deals you’re signing either for new boxes or renewals, are any of the terms changing dramatically in terms of duration or the escalators that you’ve been able to put in leases compared to a year or two ago? And then the second question is I guess in a center where you have a dark anchor from a bankruptcy like a Circuit City or a Linens, what’s the conversation when another tenant comes up and you’ve just, you know, you’re talking about signing boxes and you signed a box let’s say to rent level 20% below, what happens in the balance of the center when those leases come up for expiration? Because it looks like your renewals were pretty flat. Just wondering if you could fill us in on how those conversations go.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Sure, Michael. On the first question, not a lot of change from what we’ve historically done in terms of length of leases. The deals we are signing today are the typical, especially with the junior anchor boxes, ten year terms with a couple of options. You know in very few instances last year where we provided some rent relief we did it for a very short period of time and in some of the smaller shops, some of the local Moms and Pops, where there had to be a reduction at the time of renewal, we were doing it for a very short period of time. Sometimes as short as one year, two years or three years. But with the majority of the portfolio, no significant change in the term of the lease. On the second part, you know renewals are an interesting conversation we’re having right now with most of our major retailers. The fact that market may be $10 per square foot and we fill the vacant Circuit or Linens with a $10 deal does not give everybody the ability to automatically adjust to market when their lease comes up for renewal. You know no different than when we were analyzing rent relief early last year, when someone comes to us and says hey I want to go to market at renewal, there’s a lot of things we consider. You know what’s their opportunity, what are the alternatives? How good a store is it? We’re finding a lot of success in keeping people at least flat and sometimes telling them the option is where you need to go and that’s going to be at a contractual increase in most cases. So just the fact that we’ve leased at something less than the existing rent does not provide the opportunity to adjust to market when the other tenants are up for renewal.
Paul Freddo: I think that we just continue to stress that it’s a crucial difference between this property type and others in terms of that definition and the importance of a “market rent” figure, where for the more commodity types if there is an opportunity to [inaudible] off the street and lower your rent, there is a very natural desire and ease with which one can do that. But it’s a great difference in this property type where one, the landlord has more information because we know the sales activity that’s occurring in that box. And secondly, the retailer that actually has customers come there every day and get a certain volume of sales out of that, certainly makes a location stickier in this property type versus others.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And I also think, Mike, that one of the things that I’ve noticed over the course of the year which I thought was pretty interesting considering how much leverage the tenants have had is if you really look at our tenant allowances, even though they are higher than in past years on a total basis because of the volume of leasing that we did on a per square foot basis, our CapEx is down about 25%. And that was a very positive change, too, to have when we are negotiating with tenants what they’re willing to accept in existing spaces. And that’s been very positive for us and quite honestly very unexpected. Because tenants with a lot of leverage usually get you pretty good on the tenant allowance side, but tenants were willing to work with us with existing conditions and that was helpful. The other thing that I’m seeing in some leases that I haven’t seen in many, many years is tenants agreeing to an artificial breakpoint and paying a higher percentage over an artificial break. So for example if it’s really a $9 deal and we think it’s a $12 space, if the tenant reaches, they’ll agree to an artificial break and pay us a higher percentage over that artificial break to try to get us back to that $12. And that’s just a case of a landlord sometimes needing to show the tenant that he’s more confident in the real estate than maybe even the tenant is. And we’re willing to take a ride on some of those leases and its worked out well for us in the past. I haven’t seen that kind of deal in a long time and I’m starting to see a few of those come across my desk and it’s I think a very positive development for our industry, because as the market comes back, the $9 rents that you had to swallow hard for are really going to be $12 rents and in fact you’ve got that $12 rent and gave them 25% less in TI. So I think the story isn’t completely told yet on these rental levels, and it could be very interesting as it pans out over the next couple of years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Bilerman – Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: Just on the JV impairment, that was one of the notes that you advanced to Coventry. I assume that was just the note advance is your equity interest? Or is that something else?
David J. Oakes: The largest portion, the impairment and reserve volume for this quarter was related to joint venture development project where Coventry was our partner, where we had an equity interest and we had also advanced the partnership money to continue that development and a loan that was made about two years ago. And at this point we have fully reserved against that.
Michael Bilerman: And how is that running through just the joint venture income statement in terms of was there any FFO recognized from that note that now will not be recognized? Or was it all accrued?
David J. Oakes: There was interest income on the note that was being recognized through the majority of 2009 but as the likelihood of moving forward with that project and getting repaid on that note was reconsidered, we stopped booking the interest by the end of the year. And in fact then had to reserve against the entire balance of the note as well as the interest that had been previously recorded.
Michael Bilerman: And this was accrued interest or cash pay?
David J. Oakes: You know the note was structured where it had an interest reserve, so you could make the case either way. There was some notion of cash paid but out of an interest reserve that we had previously funded.
Michael Bilerman: Is there any other major venture I guess the size of that relative to your investment in joint ventures was sizable. Is there any other large note for advances that you have that we should be concerned about?
David J. Oakes: There are not.
Operator: And there are no more questions at this time. We’d like to thank everyone for their participation in today’s conference. You may now disconnect and have a great day."
10,SITC,1,2010,2010-04-23 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the first quarter Developers Diversified Realty Corporation conference call.  At this time all participants are in listen only mode.  We will be conducting a question and answer session towards the end of today’s conference.  (Operator Instructions)  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Ms. Kate Deck, Investor Relations Director.
Kate Deck: On today’s call you’ll hear from President and CEO Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Oakes; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development Paul Freddo.  Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  For additional information about such factors and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ may be found in a press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8K and in our Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call including FFO.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release dated April 22, 2010.  This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at DDR.com. Lastly, we will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate.  If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue.  At this time I’ll turn the call over to Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: To begin our call I’d like to highlight the progress made since the end of the first quarter of 2009 as I believe it underscores our commitment to reduce debt and enhance the quality of our portfolio.  During the last 12 months we reduced total consolidated indebtedness by $1.1 billion from $5.8 billion as of March 31, 2009 to $4.7 billion as of March 31, 2010, through incremental and strategic transactions including equity raise, retained cash flow, asset sales, open market debt repurchases and tender offers. As a result of these various transactions and again, on a year-over-year basis, we were able to reduce our prorate debt to EBTIDA from 10 times to 9.1 times, well on our way to our goal of the mid eight times range by year end.  In addition to leverage reductions, we also increased the weighted average maturity of our debt by over one year, resulting in greater financial flexibility and a more balanced debt maturity profile. With respect to our liquidity position, the balance available on our revolving credit facility has increased by over $900 million from the cycle low availability of less than $100 million a year ago.  Regarding portfolio operations, over the trailing 12 month period we were available to increase our leased rate from 90.7% to 91.3%.  Overall, we are encouraged by the progress we have made over the past year and believe the execution of our strategy signifies a disciplined focus of delivering results based upon the expectations that we set for ourselves and partnership with our investors. As we navigate the first half of 2010, we remain keenly focused on the operating and balance sheet initiatives that we identified in January.  From an operational perspective, our commitment to improving our lease rate has resulted in marginal gains within our portfolio and record setting deal volumes.  We have seen momentum building in the junior anchor box category as market dominance and expanding retailers seek external growth in high quality shopping centers amid a diminishing supply of such space. Deal economics are still challenged and lease spreads remain negative.  However, we are encouraged by the aggressiveness we are seeing with some of our stronger retail partners.  The decline in same store NOI has moderated and we expect further improvement throughout the year as new leases come on line in Q3 for the back to school selling season and Q4 for the holidays.  In addition to enhancing the quality of our shopping centers through lease up, we remain focused on overall portfolio management by pruning the portfolio of underperforming centers and selling non-prime assets. Before turning the call over to Paul, I’d like to take a minute to highlight and improvement we are seeing with regard to our accounts receivable balances across the portfolio.  Accounts receivable in general is often a good indicator of future retailer health and typically tells a story one way or another.  On a positive note, within the month of March, our collections group was able to record the largest monthly reduction of receivables within the past four years.  We have all learned over the past few years that just because you bill a tenant that doesn’t necessarily mean that they will automatically pay you. But, through a combination of aggressive collecting and improving conditions, our tenants are paying their bills.  We obviously view these results as very encouraging from both a macroeconomic perspective and retailer operational perspective as there appears to be less distress among tenants and more overall liquidity resulting in our collection team growing more effective in its efforts to reduce our outstanding balances. We certainly understand that one month does not foretell the results for the remaining nine but we will continue to monitor this effort very closely as it may indicate a positive trend over time and a healthier outlook for retailers as the years continue.  I’ll now turn the call over to Paul who will discuss what we’re seeing in the retail environment and provider greater details about our portfolio operations.
Paul W. Freddo: I’d like to begin with a brief update on the retail environment which continues to show signs of improvement.  After a better than anticipated holiday season retailers continued their momentum in to the late winter and Easter season by posting better than anticipated results in February and March.  The March sales results were notable not because of the headline comp increase which benefited from the calendar shift and favorable weather but because of the underlying sales trends. While April sales will be negatively impacted by the calendar shift, the upward revisions that many retailers made to their first quarter earnings guidance reflects their improved sales outlook, much cleaner inventory position, strong initial reaction to spring fashions and a favorable margin outlook due to the increase in discretionary spending. Strong sales and solid earnings growth for retailers translate in to expansion plans and we are working with numerous retailers who need space to meet their open to buys for store openings in the next two years.  Top line sales are now in the sport light and our core retail partners in the value and office price channels are increasingly viewing square footage expansion as their primary vehicle for top line growth particularly in low inflationary to even deflationary environments for some categories. This is evidenced by the volume of new deals that we executed in the first quarter and the increased representation that may retailers are bringing to the Las Vegas ICSC show in May.  We are also seeing retailers become more flexible in size and location in order to meet their goals which marks a significant change from 2009 when retailers could be more selective.  Quality space continues to be in demand and this bodes well for the lease up of our portfolio. As Dan mentioned, deal velocity continued to be strong in the first quarter.  In addition to breaking a company record for new leases signed in a single quarter, we increased our lease to occupancy rate by 10 basis points to 91.3%.  This compares favorably to a historic average decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of tenant fall out.  During the first quarter we completed 180 new deals representing 1.2 million square feet and 242 new renewals for 1.4 million square feet.  In total, we executed 422 deals during the first quarter for 2.6 million square feet. These results include the cumulative efforts of our leasing team for both owned and managed assets though our supplemental disclosure does not match exactly, it is only centers in which we have an ownership interest are included in the supplement.  Based on current deal flow, we remain confident that we will achieve a lease occupancy rate of at least 92% by year end. Spreads remain challenged but we are starting to see some improvement in deal economics.  Spreads for new deals were -5.9% for the quarter.  This compares favorably with the -15.3% for the fourth quarter of 2009.  Renewal spreads for the quarter were -1.9%.  This was impacted by the decision to negotiate some short term renewals at reduced rates enabling us to negotiate more favorable longer term rates in an improving economic environment. In total we executed 39 one year renewals with the expectation that we will be in a better environment to discuss longer term deals a year from now.  Our combined spreads for new deals and renewals was -2.9%.  Looking forward to the balance of the year, we expect spreads on new leases to remain slightly negative and for renewals to be roughly flat. In regard to back filling big box vacancies and our anchor store redevelopment team continues to make substantial progress in the first quarter leasing 12 units for over 524,000 square feet.  Of the 6.9 million square feet of space returned through the five major bankruptcies, we now have some level of activity on 63% of the space, including 31% leased or sold and 32% in LOI or lease negotiations.  In the first quarter we executed deals with many of today’s most active retailers including the Fresh Market, Kohls, buybuy Baby, Forever 21, TJ Maxx, Burlington Coat Factory and Hobby Lobby. Our prime portfolio continued to perform well and ended the quarter with a leased occupancy rate of 92.9%.  We’ve introduced additional disclosure to the supplement regarding the prime portfolio including the number of centers, GLA and percent of our total NOI.  It is important to note that these 265 shopping centers make up roughly half of our total owned assets but generate over 80% of our total NOI.  Our strategy continues to be to hold these assets for the long term and sell the non-prime assets where it makes financial sense further simplifying the focus on the high quality assets that dominate our results. Our ancillary income department continues to mitigate NOI losses from vacant space while also helping our retail partners meet their increasing demand for seasonal space.  For the first quarter, ancillary income for the combined portfolio was $8.8 million which is a 13% increase over the same period in 2009.  The deal volume for the remainder of the year is very encouraging especially in the seasonal categories which are benefitting from the entrance of additional players in to the market for temporary locations for the Halloween and Christmas season. Turning to operations in Brazil, our portfolio continued to perform well with same store NOI growth of 11.2% for the quarter and a portfolio leased rate of 97.7%.  We continue to see opportunities for growth in Brazil and recently started construction of a new mall in Uberlandia with a planned opening in the fall of 2011.  Uberlandia is an underserved market located north of Sao Paulo.  Last week we secured an $81 million construction loan on the mall which is currently 53% leased and will be anchored by Wal-Mart and Cinemark.  We also recently started a 60,000 square foot expansion at our largest and most successful asset Parque dom Pedro which is expected to open this fall. With regard to the development in the domestic portfolio, we continue to minimize ground up development spending while allocating capital to the lease up of existing projects.  However, we do see a great opportunity to redevelop a number of our existing assets.  We view this as a strong growth opportunity that we intend to fully capitalize on.  We recently hired a professional experienced in development and redevelopment to oversee this program and are excited about the opportunity to create value without the risk of capital requirement of new developments. In summary, we had another strong quarter for leasing activity and expect the momentum to continue throughout the year.  Our number one focus continues to be on leasing up vacant space.  We’re encouraged by the increasingly optimistic mood in the retail community heading in to recon in Las Vegas and expect to capitalize fully on the various opportunities to fill space with best in class retailers. Now, I will turn the call over to David.
David J. Oakes: I’d like to begin by highlighting the various changes and improvements that we’ve made to our quarterly earnings supplemental.  Our goal is to consistently provide best in class transparency and deliver disclosure that provides the most comprehensive view of our company in the most efficient fashion.  This prompted us to complete an intensive internal review of our current disclosure and take direction from our analyst and investors which lead us to add new information, remove less relevant information and clean up our existing documents so that it is easier for investors and analysts to understand and to use. Many of the changes appear this quarter and we will roll out additional changes for the second quarter supplemental as well.  We hope that you find the new and improved supplemental useful and your continued feedback is always appreciated. Turning now to our quarterly financial results; operating FFO was $0.28 per share for the first quarter.  Including certain non-operating and primarily non-cash net charges, FFO was $0.12 per share for the quarter.  Once again, impairments and other non-cash charges skewed our true operating results.  The charges taken this quarter aggregate $36 million and are primarily to a loss on equity derivative instruments related to the auto warrants as well as impairments and losses associated with assets being marked for sale. As evidenced by our capital markets activity this quarter, we continue to actively and opportunistically raise capital, reduce leverage and extend our debt duration.  We started the quarter by raising $46 million through our continues equity program at an average price of $9.30 per share.  We stopped selling shares in this manner in January.  In February we completed a $350 million common equity offering and in March we issued $300 million in senior unsecured notes with a seven year term. We also tendered for $83 million of our 2010, 2011 senior unsecured notes, generated retained earnings of approximately $45 million and sold $456 million of assets which after JV partner interests netted $95 million of proceeds to DDR for leverage reductions.  All of this activity netted the company over $800 million of capital this quarter which was predominately used to delever and secondarily reinvest in our assets. Additionally, we were part of the first multi borrower CMBS transaction to close since 2008 for our DDR domestic retail fund joint venture.  This $30 million financing is for a five year term at a rate of 4.2%.  It replaces three loans with a comparable balance maturing in 2010.  Availability of capital has improved significant for our industry and especially for our company over the past year and we have been taking advantage of these conditions to raise considerable amount of new capital. Many of these financings were initially budgeted to occur later in 2010 but we recognized the opportunity to reduce risk and we took it in the first quarter.  For the past year, we have articulated a strategy of lowering leverage, increasing liquidity and extending duration with the goal of lowering our risk profile and our long term cost of capital and we are pleased with the progress made during this year, especially this quarter. The proceeds from our various capital raising activities this quarter went primarily to repay debt.  We repurchased $156 million of near term unsecured notes, paid off over $150 million of consolidated mortgage maturities in addition to removing $392 million of mortgages affiliated with assets sold.  We also paid down our revolving credit facilities by over $400 million this quarter.  We reduced total consolidated debt from $5.2 billion a year end to $4.7 billion today which is more than half way to our goal of $4.4 billion by year end 2010. We lowered our pro rata debt to EBITDA ratio from 9.54 times at year end to 9.12 times today and we expect this ratio to be in the mid eight times range by year end driven primarily by continued asset sales and retained capital as well as improving EBITDA.  Additionally, we extended the weight average maturity of our debt from March 2013 to July 2013 and increased liquidity to roughly $1 billion of cash and availability on our revolving credit facilities. Today, we have approximately $310 million of wholly owned debt maturing this year which consists of almost $300 million of two series of senior unsecured notes maturing in May and August and one small mortgage.  We will address our maturities using availability on our revolving credit facilities, proceeds from assets sales, retained cash flow and funds from available discretionary capital raising activities. After several refinancing completed in April, our share of unconsolidated mortgage maturities in 2010 totaled approximately $200 million.  Most of these loans are in the process of being refinanced, extended or in some cases the assets are being sold.  We have also made progress reducing our 2011 wholly owned maturities which total roughly $750 million including $346 million outstanding on the revolvers.  As many of you are aware, our revolving credit facilities have their initial maturity this June but have a one year extension at our option that we expect to exercise shortly. We are currently in discussions with participating banks as well as several banks that are not current participants that have expressed an interest in joining.  We’ll reduce the size of our revolvers by at least 25% as we implement a longer term financing strategy and shift away from reliance on short term debt.  This strategy has been demonstrated by the $900 million reduction in our borrowing on our revolver since this time last year. Smaller facilities will still provide ample borrowing ability without incurring the cost to support excess capacity that we do not intend to use.  The facilities will be more appropriately sized for our disciplined growth strategy going forward.  We’re encouraged by the feedback we have received from banks this far and we plan to close on the new facilities in the fourth quarter of this year. We remain compliant, as we always have with our credit facility and bond covenants and the cushion on some of these covenants have hit positive levels that we have not seen in several years but expect to maintain.  Our historically tightest covenant has been the consolidated outstanding debt to consolidated market value ratio and the unencumbered asset coverage ratio as calculated for the revolving credit facilities.  In the first quarter the consolidated debt ratio was 57%, well within the 65% limit and the unencumbered asset coverage ratio was just over two times, well above the 1.6 times minimum.  This marks the first time since the second quarter of 2006 that the unencumbered ratio has been over two times. Enhancing the size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool has been important for us as we seek to solidify investment grade credit ratings. We continue to proactively raise capital to repay first mortgages on wholly owned assets and have not replaced many of them which results in more property being added to the unencumbered pool.  In May we will repay a 9% $60 million loan which will release two large prime assets in to the unencumbered asset pool and will further reduce our cost of capital. Recently we formerly engaged Fitch to provide corporate credit ratings for us going forward.  We are now formerly covered by three rating agencies.  As you recall we are still investment grade rated at Moodys and remain focused on earning our way back to that level with S&P and Fitch.  We continue to work closely with all rating agencies to ensure that they have the most up to date information and that they are aware of the balance sheet progress that we continue to make. Finally, I’d like to provide an update on MDT.  As we stated in a press release yesterday morning, MDT completed a provide placement with EPN of $9.5 million Australian dollars and plans to construct and entitlement offer to raise an additional $200 million Australian dollars.  The proceeds from both capital raises will be used to stabilize MDT’s balance sheet by reducing leverage and extending duration. As part of the recapitalization EPN will buy Macquarie’s 50% stake in the US manager and will become our new partner in managing the trust.  EPN is a joint venture of two public companies, Elbit Imaging and Plaza Centers and one private group, Eastgate Property, all of which have long and successful track records of real estate investing. Since the redemption of our interest in the main MDT joint venture last year, our only real economic involvement with MDT is through our asset management, leasing and property management contracts all of which stay in place with their current fee streams.  We are pleased to see the trust raise capital from an experienced real estate investors in order to stabilize its balance sheet and we look forward to working closely with EPN to create value for MDT unit holders through our services. I’d like to wrap up by stating that although we have made significant strides reducing leverage, extending maturities, enhancing portfolio quality this quarter, we remain extremely focused on continued improvement and we look forward to updating you throughout the year with our progress.  I’ll now turn the call back over to Dan for his closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: As you’ve heard, we had a very active first quarter and made significant progress on our balance sheet and operating initiatives.  As David mentioned, the major financing transactions that took place during the quarter were initially budgeted to occur in the middle of the year.  As a result of the timing of these transactions and the higher weighted average share count and higher short term interest expense that will exist for 2010, we are lowering our operating FFO guidance to $1.00 to $1.05 per share. The lower guidance is exclusively a function of the timing of capital raises and there is no change to our EBITDA projections as operations continue to track on budget.  Consistent with our articulated strategy and given the still fragile state of the economic environment, the uncertainty surrounding capital market conditions and the strong advice received from the market through various sources, we firmly believe we made the right decision to reduce risk and to execute transactions when we did and as a result has significantly enhanced our company’s balance sheet and long term capital structure at the short term expense of 2010 FFO. From a quarterly standpoint, second quarter FFO will be our weakest as the full dilution of the capital raising will be reflected at the same time that the smallest amount of the rental income from all our leasing activity will be in place.  Simply put, tenants rarely open new stores in the second quarter.  The third and fourth quarters should show solid growth sequentially as more of this rental income comes on line. Before turning the call over to questions, I’d like to address a few corporate initiatives that I believe highlight our commitment to shareholders and forward thinking ideas.  First, as many of you know, we have engaged a third party consultant to conduct a perception study of investors’ sentiment towards our company.  This is the second consecutive year we have engaged this firm to conduct a perception study in an effort to gage progress made and identify additional areas for improvement. Last year’s survey uncovered various strengths and weaknesses of our investor relations and strategic planning efforts and that feedback was greatly appreciated and acted upon.  Our consultant was in the market for the past several weeks to finish this year’s survey and I would like to personally thank each of you that participated for taking your time to share your thoughts.  Your perspective and feedback is truly valued and will certainly be considered by the management team and our board of directors just as it was last year. Second, we recently conducted a research study designed to reveal how evolving consumer behavior, changing demographics and the economy will shape shopping center leasing, development and property management well in to the future.  The study focused on projections for the years 2014 to 2020 and included interviews with several industry resources including shopping center industry executives, major retailers, authors, academics and economists.  The research was rather revealing for our property type and more specifically for our portfolio and will serve as a guideline for future operating initiatives. We are currently preparing an executive summary that will be made available to the investment community upon completion.  This is a very thought provoking study that will be an invaluable tool in understanding future trends and strategies within our business.  At this time operator we’d be happy to take some questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Alexander D. Goldfarb – Sandler O’Neill & Partners, LP.
Alexander D. Goldfarb: The first question is just thinking about guidance and it sounds like retail activity has been picking up.  I think at the end of last year you guys gave guidance for about $40 million of leasing costs this year.  One, I want to know if you’re still comfortable with that or if you think it could be higher.  Then two, I think you still have some remaining ATM capacity so I just want to know if that’s factored in to your new revised $1 to $1.05, whether that’s in there or not?
Paul W. Freddo: On the first question we’re clearly okay with the $40 million.  We are right at it and tracking to that number at this point.  By the way, if  it’s slightly higher we would view that as good news in terms of leasing activity but right now it’s exactly what we’re tracking.
David J. Oakes: And very much sticking to our discipline of not incentivizing retailers simply by writing them checks to occupy our space but trying to sign efficient and appropriately economic deals.  On the second item on the ATM program, we do have additional capacity there and could certainly put additional capacity in to place.  At this point based on the equity that we raised in the first quarter, we don’t have plans to do to raise additional equity but we do have the capacity to do it and certainly as we look around at opportunities, it would be a potential tool to help fund that as any sort of investment activity that we would look at would be funded with a very high component of equity and the tests for if it made any sense would be compared to that cost of equity as opposed to anything like our line of credit costs.  But, at this point don’t have plans and have not been active in the market with the ATM additional capacity.
Alexander D. Goldfarb: My second question is if I just look at the stock reaction today it’s off versus the group and the rest of the REITs.  I’m wondering if it’s possibly driven by sort of the items, the charges that you guys took in this quarter and what some other potential charges or items could be in the balance of the year that may show improvement for the company or may be reflected in like the auto derivatives which investors can think about so as not to be surprised when those sorts of things come out?
David J. Oakes: We acknowledge that the results have been messier than would be ideal over the past two years really.  We’re pleased that this quarter has less of those items than was the case in most quarters over the past at least year and a half but still some of that remains.  The auto derivative which is by far the largest charge this quarter related to the revaluation of their warrants is something that we will have to deal with until those warrants are exercised so potentially an additional four years of that.  It’s completely counterintuitive in some ways where the positive performance of the stock was the exclusive driver of what that charge exists and if the stock would trade down that would actually be a gain in future periods and so very, very far away from the real economic impact that you’d think of there but one we won’t be able to get away from. As we do sell assets there may be additional impairment charges and losses on sales.  We certainly don’t think it will be anything as large as has existed over the past two years but constantly some ability for that to happen.  Most importantly though I think as we’ve said many times, after years of this company driving growth in FFO per share and having a heavy focus at the board and management and strategic level on maximizing FFO per share, it is not the primary metric we are looking at today.  So we won’t let our investment strategy be driven by the short term maximization of FFO per share. So in the cases where we continue to look at asset sales that may generate losses or impairment that conversation is exclusively happening in the context of do these asset sales make sense at this pricing?  Is this real estate we don’t want to own?  Is this real estate where we expect the NOI to be lower in the coming years rather than higher?  So there will continue to be FFO impacts from activity like that but we firmly believe it is the right strategic decision.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Habermann – Goldman Sachs.
Jay Habermann: Dan or Paul, maybe starting off with a comment on retail sales and the strength you saw in March and obviously the positive picture for much of this year.  Obviously, that’s had an impact on tenant demand but can you talk about the potential for stronger demand in 2011 say versus ’12 openings?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: One of the things that we’re clearly seeing Jay is tenants very, very concerned about 2012.  2012 is a year that as you know we’re going to have significant increases in occupancy throughout the industry for 2010 and 2011.  There’s really no new supply of space being built.  Tenants have been indicating that they’re comfortable with 2010, they’re somewhat comfortable with the opportunities in 2011 but they’re very concerned about their opportunities in 2012 because the supply and demand ratio should shift dramatically as company’s like ours and all the other companies quite frankly in retail continue to increase their occupancy levels.  We think demand for space in 2011 for 2012 will be extremely strong and we think it will be equally as strong as we’re seeing now for 2011 in 2010 if not stronger.
Paul W. Freddo: Jay, I would add on to that that in our conversations with these retailers, clearly there’s concern and I know that Dan mentioned that.  But we need to emphasize that there’s concern about where they’re going to meet their square footage growth needs and nobody is indicating that this is a short term growth plan and then we’re going to be satisfied with our store count, quite to the contrary.  It’s going to be an interesting dynamic in the next few years as the demand increases and the supply diminishes.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think we’re going to see and hear some of the results of that pressure on retailers at recon in May because it’s really not too early to start talking about 2012 especially for some of the larger boxes who are trying to allocate capital for future years.  I think this year at recon will be vastly different than last year, hopefully.  I think we’ll start to feel or see some of the pressure under retailers to secure space as opposed to all the pressure on the landlords to fill space.
Jay Habermann: Can you comment a bit about say rents versus occupancy, the trade off there?  I know you mentioned strength in the junior anchor box spaces but it’s my understand that some of the remaining spaces are now either the more challenges spaces to lease?  So can you comment a bit sort of about that dynamic between rent versus occupancy for the balance of this year?  Should we see leasing spreads continue to soften?
Paul W. Freddo: We will continue to see the spread soften and part of that is the increase demand.  A couple of things we’re seeing Jay, I mean a lot more competition for space.  That’s one of the things and we’ve talked about it on prior calls, there was no competition for space last year.  They were all very selective and picking and choosing and we rarely saw two retailers looking at the same box.  That has changed dramatically and so with that competition comes certainly a different discussion when it comes to rent. Retailers are clearly remaining disciplined in the rents they are willing to pay but again, we are seeing movement in that.  One of the things we also mentioned previously is that retailers are coming back to markets and locations that they passed on a year ago.  They’re not going crazy and considering markets that they shouldn’t be in but they are being more flexible in the markets that they will go to.  A typical call would be, “Hey that market we told you no interest in last August let’s talk about.”  That’s also improving our situation. Flexibility and size is another thing we’re seeing especially with the junior anchors.  A lot of them realize that their prototype doesn’t fit what’s available so we’ve seen several of them come with a smaller prototype and just try and figure out how they’re going to get more space.  I’m not overly concerned about the fact that the best goes first and what’s left is not desirable because we’re seeing more and more activity on a great majority of the space.
Jay Habermann: Lastly maybe for David, did you give a specific asset sales target for the balance of the year to get to your mid eight target on leverage?
David J. Oakes: We indicated in the portion of the press release where we updated guidance that the assumptions on all the operating metrics were the same so I apologize that we didn’t go in to detail on that.  But, we’re still looking at for DDR’s pro rata share of asset sales to be $150 million for the year and very much believe we are on pace to hit that, of course that number netting out our joint venture partner’s share of some of those things.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christy McElroy – UBS.
Christy McElroy: David, just following up on Alex’s question, with a longer term goal of further deleveraging given your stock is up pretty substantially from where you issued equity back in February, how do you weigh your options in terms of thinking about potentially raising more equity at this level?  Arguably much lower implied cost of capital in February versus other options for raising capital and reducing debt?  Is there an opportunity to pay down more debt as you look to refinance your credit facilities over the next few months?
David J. Oakes: We’re certainly encouraged by the market’s response to the progress we’ve made thus far and by the strong performance of the stock year-to-date and particularly since the equity offering.  We are constantly thinking about our access to capital and our cost of capital and we are most driven by our goal of lowering that long term weighted average cost of capital and so we’re evaluating that on a regular basis.  From the plan that we’ve been articulating, we believe we can achieve our leverage targets in a reasonable period of time without additional equity being raised simply for purposes of debt repayment. So, I think if we would look at additional equity raising activity it would more likely be with some investment activity that we thought was opportunistic enough to justify a high level of equity funding.  At this point we don’t have anything that we’re too active on or that we’re willing to talk about today.  It’s something that we think about but we truly believe there are other initiatives that there are other ways that we can lower our debt in ways that are less costly from a long term perspective than selling common equity even at $13 a share with both our ability to improve EBTIDA and our ability to lower debt in other means.
Christy McElroy: Then just sort of following along those same lines, we’ve seen signs of cap rate compression for high quality assets in good markets but have you seen more interest in or pricing that would make sense that you might sell more of the assets in your non-core portfolio than maybe you’re sort of targeting right now, the $150 million?  I’m just trying to get a sense for whether or not there’s been much cap rate compression for BC assets in secondary tertiary markets?
David J. Oakes: I would firmly agree with your initial point that there has been continued compression in cap rates and no longer is that just a talking point, there’s much more tangible evidence that that is occurring and there are many more prints out there that would clearly, clearly indicate that prices have come up and cap rates have come down.  That is somewhat separate from the world that we are living in with many of our asset sales where the institutional players purchasing the high quality assets which represent most of our portfolio are clearly paying higher prices than they would have even three months ago, let along 12 months ago. We’ve seen a bit of that flow through to the non-prime assets that we’re selling.  We’re particularly seeing some benefit there as the financing market improves and the ability to put financing on assets that aren’t of the highest quality has clearly improved.  So we’ve seen a bit of tightening with the assets in the caliber of stuff we’re trying to see but nowhere near what’s occurred to market pricing for the core of what we own and what we’re not looking to sell. For now, the budget remains $150 million of asset sales this year.  But we certainly view it as a long term strategic initiative to lower the amount of exposure we have to non-prime assets and so we’ll see how the transaction market turns out over the rest of the year to evaluate if it could make strategic sense for this company to push that figure a little higher for next year and leave a little less to do in the coming years.
Christy McElroy: So of your targeted dispositions this year what kind of cap rates are you sort of projecting on those transactions?
David J. Oakes: We have budgeted in the 9% to 10% range for some of the stuff that we’re selling that really is non-prime B and probably much, much closer to C quality real estate.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Schmidt – Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt: When I look at the lease expiration schedules between December 31, 2007 and the one that you just posted for March 31, 2010, the total rent roll for shops basis is essentially flat but the anchor drops from 1,492 to 1,104.  I just wondered what is accounting for that drop in the anchor space?
Kate Deck: Craig we were including temporary tenants in the fourth quarter disclosure and we have decided with our new disclosure to not include those as it skews the 2010 and 2011 years in particular.  But, to give you a more accurate representation of our long term leases we decided to exclude those so that’s the reason for the drop.
Craig Schmidt: I assume at some point with the releasing of the junior anchors there’s going to be some spaces you just aren’t able to lease in their current configurations.  What goes in to the decision to consider reconfiguring that space to maybe lease to a more flexible size box?
Paul W. Freddo: Well obviously there’s a process Craig.  You start with the next best retail available interested in your box and we work right down through less desirable retail and this enters in to our whole prime non-prime discussion and which assets we’re going to be more selective about who we release with. But clearly we’re looking at a small bottom percentage of that portfolio of vacant box and what do we do with it.  We’re very aggressive in how we’re looking at repositioning them. We’ve had a couple of examples where we’re going to consider knocking down, razing that box and then replacing it with some much more valuable outparcels, just trade GLA for GLA if you will.  But, you start with who is the best in class that you can get in and you work your way through the retail line up and then you get down to where we may have some non-retail uses of which there are some or simply again scraping the box and replacing GLA with GLA in a more desirable configuration and location.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Jeff Donnelly: Dan, at the prior peak many of the retail REITs, I think you guys at well, were running at occupancies over 96%, sometimes closing in on 97%.  As you look down the road, I don’t know three to five years forward, do you feel that’s a threshold the shopping center REITs or even DDR in specific can retain or do you think that was unique to the last cycle and the next peak might be a little lower?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think the next peak is going to be a little lower Jeff for a couple of reasons.  Number one, overall today if you were to really look at the inventory of potential tenants for space there are fewer of them.  We’ve lost a few, more than a few and if we don’t have some new ones come in to the market which we haven’t seen in a very, very long time there just aren’t going to be enough people to take all the space. As we look at our portfolio we feel that full occupancy going forward will be in that 95.5% range, down from that 96.5% to 97% where we were at our peak in the past.  We think that’s a stable number that can be maintained.  That gives us as you know another couple of hundred basis points of occupancy that’s available for internal growth within our portfolio and we feel that the market is going to be able to sustain that going forward.
Jeff Donnelly: Just a follow up and I’m not sure if this is better put to you David but how do the average bumps in the new leases that you’ve been signing in 2009 and 2010 compare to what the growth is that’s in your existing lease base?  I guess I’m wondering on one hand have you lost a little bit of pricing power?  But, on the flip side how are you incorporating the opportunity you talk about for 2012 and beyond in to the way you’re setting leases today?
Paul W. Freddo: The deals we’re cutting today Jeff, the bumps are very typical of historic bumps.  Obviously, we’re starting at a lower base and I’d say on the one hand we’ve been more successful in getting sooner and large bumps from some of the anchor boxes just because of the low starting point.  But, we haven’t given anything away in terms of the growth, particularly in those anchor box leases over the typical would be some percentage at year five and 10, etc., etc.  But, we’ve been trying with that lower start rate to at least get some more significant and sooner bumps.
Jeff Donnelly: If I can just ask maybe one last question then, Dan you mentioned about that opportunity over 2012, how do you think that manifests itself in investment opportunities because retailers it’s not that they just want space, they want space that they can access their customers.  So, does that paint a picture where there’s going to be much greater compression in cap rates or high demand for in fill properties or do you think there’s an opportunity to go by the outlining more vacant centers or so called busted developments?
Paul W. Freddo: Let me start with something that I alluded to in my script and then I’ll let David and Dan answer the cap rate compression story.  But, one of the things that we mentioned was this idea of redevelopment of reexisting assets.  Dan and I both hit on the fact that there is clearly diminishing supply, no new supply being created and we see demand at least steady with today’s rate and possibly increasing. That’s really the background to our decision to look hard at redevelopment of existing assets which I think fits in to that in fill question you’re asking Jeff.  There are lots of great locations that retailers have wanted that are just not properly configured today or tenanted.  We’re going to look very hard at that opportunity.  I’m not sure what that means right now which is why we’ve hired someone to come in and help us understand it.  But, we’re going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how big an opportunity that is.  We think it’s a great one and we’re going to fully capitalize it. We believe that’s a great way for retailers to meet that need, redevelopment of existing space comes without a lot of the risk of new ground up development obviously and we’re excited about that opportunity and think it’s a way we will meet some of the retailers demand.
David J. Oakes: I think the cap rate question on certain sub sectors within the property type is still particularly hard to answer as it is so asset by asset versus other property types, suburban versus downtown or CBD office question can always be talked about.  We see just as many in fill assets trading at much higher than average cap rates simply because they’ve got rents in place that are so far above market and don’t allow for retailer profitability as you do suburban assets where sometimes you have more reasonable rents in place. It’s hard to say there’s a specific rule there.  It’s really just going to be driven by where the tenant can do the best sales and what the right configuration is for the consumer to make it convenient for our sort of value oriented tenants.
Operator: Your next question comes from [Quincent Bellei] – Citi.
[Quincent Bellei]: Just going back to the guidance, the revised guidance, can you just clarify how much additional dilution there is the revised guidance number in terms of any further debt issuance and the asset sales and whether there are any land sales?  The magnitude of how many cents of dilution you have in that guidance number?
David J. Oakes: As far as our guidance for the rest of the year, we talked about the amount of asset sales we’ve completed thus far and so we expect to get to that full $150 million number for the year as a whole, potentially could exceed that based on activity we have today which is why we provide a range rather than a single point estimate.  In terms of additional capital markets activity, we don’t want to be overly specific but we’re clear in the fact that extending the duration of our debt is extremely important and so while our line of credit doesn’t actually mature until June ’11 I think we’d very much plan to have something done this year and incorporate a little extra cost from that happening sooner rather than riding the 1% wave for the cost of the current revolver longer. Secondly, to give ourselves room to raise additional long term debt over the course of this year which we absolutely believe is the right strategic decision to lower the risk profile of this company.  So we have incorporated additional progress on delivering and duration extension through the remaining eight months of this year.
[Quincent Bellei]: About how many cents of dilution is in the revised guidance number?
David J. Oakes: I mean for additional activity there’s a few additional cents in there.  The reality is it was a range previously that for ease we’ll all talk about the midpoint and so you can say that the total difference is that $0.07 to $0.08 from prior guidance to new guidance.  The reality is there’s still some assumptions that go in to this.  We could end up at the high end of that range but not necessarily be completely pleased with our activity if we’d have foregone what we believe are the right capital markets activity or we could stress it and be at the low end of that range for 2010 but not have made the continued balance sheet progress that we want. We’re looking at that $0.05 range as something that we feel comfortable, is achievable today over the next eight months even with several additional transactions that will improve the balance sheet whether it’s through deleveraging or whether it’s through duration extension.
[Quincent Bellei]: We’re seeing some preferred issues by some other retail REITS, is that something that you’ve been looking in to?
David J. Oakes: Certainly something we’d consider.  I think we’ve all been clearly reminded that leverage and fixed charges were not the only issues that companies had but very importantly a balance and as extended as possible maturity schedule is extremely important and so looking at tight spreads between where perpetual preferred is available versus long term debt, there’s some interest there.  On the other hand we do have a good amount of preferred in our capital structure today so it’s certainly something that we look at, believe we have access to and have had conversations regarding but no plans today on any specific additional capital raising.
Michael Bilerman: David, I guess do you think about some of the capital markets activities that you did and clearly part of it was just bringing dilution forward.  I think some of the reduction in guidance clearly reflected that you did things earlier rather than later but that dilution was eventually going to come.  It sounds like in some of the things that you’re talking about now is you’re still trying to figure out how aggressive you’re going to be in pulling future dilution forward in to 2010 which is why you’re sort of saying guidance for this year could still change potentially or you may come in at the high end. I guess when you step back from it, how much more I guess capital raising negative spread if you think about it over a two to three year time frame should we be thinking about?  I’m just trying to get a sense of when you look at your capital stack and the cost of capital, how do you think about where you are today in terms of your in place debt and what sort of rate you would target at on a refinance and how much dilution is there still on the come whether it be in 2010 guidance already or whether it’s an ’11 or ’12 event?
David J. Oakes: I think a big part of what you’re talking about is the right way to think about it Michael in terms of if we were out there with 2011 guidance today and I know you guys certainly model 2011 already, the activity that we’ve completed year-to-date and the activity that we expect to complete through yearend while it has had an impact on 2010 FFO, we really don’t believe it’s had an impact on 2011 FFO. It’s exactly as you say, it’s a timing issue of improving this balance sheet a little sooner and so it’s a lower 2010 FFO stream from a better balance sheet and it’s a balance sheet that we had always targeted and talked about but not necessarily one that we would count on we could put in place as quickly as we did.  If you look at the maturity profile for the next few years, there’s still some very attractively priced debt in place.  There’s still $350 million on the revolver that costs barely over 1% today.  There’s still $800 million on a term loan that costs marginally above 1% today. Some of that floating rate has been swapped and we give the details on those swaps where LIBOR is locked at 4% or even higher so you’ve probably already got that baked in.  But, there are certainly some attractively priced debt that exists on balance sheet today that we believe will have to be rolled in to a somewhat more expensive costs almost under any scenario that you look at over the next few years.  That number is dramatically smaller than what needed to be done six to 12 months ago but there’s still some attractively priced debt in place. Mitigating that on the other side we’ve got a heck of a lot more non-income producing assets than we’ve had at any other point in time and that’s directly related to some of the stuff that Paul was talking about the vacancy in the core prime portfolio that we expect to be cash flowing over the next couple of years but it also relates to nearly $1 billion in non-income producing land and construction in progress on the balance sheet that will be coming online.  So we don’t think it’s completely fair to just talk about the dilutive side of the changes that are being made because there are some benefits, especially as we’ve stopped capitalizing interest and real estate taxes on a bigger and bigger portion of our development pipeline and we’re taking those costs for an asset that benefits us in no way from the typical ratios we’re talking about and so could benefit us in a big way if we would explore more aggressively which we certainly are today, the sale of some of those assets. I think you continue to see an interest expense line item that moves up but we would hope that you see an EBITDA line item that can outpace that over the coming years.  One other item I’d mention is that while we don’t view FFO per share as the exclusive focus especially for the current year of what this company is trying to deliver, we do take our guidance very seriously and we do think this is the appropriate range to think about for the rest of the year even incorporating additional balance sheet improvement activities.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Mueller – JP Morgan Securities, Inc.
Mike Mueller: Just two quick questions, one is any color at this point on line of credit pricing and secondly, any thoughts on the dividend as you move through 2010 and in to 2011?  Let me actually throw a addendum on there too, the yearend target for 8.5 times for debt to EBITDA, any thoughts on the year end 2011 target?
David J. Oakes: First on the line of credit, actively involved in the dialog today.  We still have 16 months until the final maturity so we’ve got a good amount of time, 15 months I guess.  But, we believe we will have something done well before that.  As a few other quality investment grade REITs have put lines in place recently I think there’s more that we can point to as third party evidence of where that pricing is coming out more so than directly talking about anything coming out of our conversation but our spreads relative to LIBOR somewhere in the 300 basis point range seem to be where other transactions are happening today for unsecured lines of credit. We hope as we continue to make progress that there’s an opportunity to improve that even further but I think that’s pretty representative of market turns from what other quality competitors have reported thus far.  On the dividend it’s obviously a decision of our board of directors.  From a taxable income perspective, we expect to maintain low enough taxable income this year to give ourselves an extreme level of flexibility with how that dividend can turn out and so it really just becomes a constant and quarterly evaluation in terms of management’s recommendation and then the board’s approval for a dividend policy there. So for now we’ve stuck with the $0.02 a quarter.  It provides considerable retained cash flow.  We believe that we have very good uses for that retained cash flow today and it’s an important part of our process to continue to lower leverage.  Debt to EBITDA, we haven’t outlined a specific target for yearend 2011.  We’ve talked about on this pro rata debt to EBITDA which we believe is the more conservative calculation.  We’ve talked about the mid eights target for the end of 2010.  We’ve also talked about a long term target of seven times so we haven’t exactly filled in that blank for where you end up for 2011 but I think we know where we’re headed for this year and we know where we’re headed for the longer term but obviously want to continue to stay nimble as this market evolves.
Operator: Your next  question comes from Jim Sullivan – Green Street Advisors.
Jim Sullivan: A question regarding receivables and the bad debt expense for the quarter.  In the prepared comments there was favorable commentary regarding collections and where the receivables are at the end of the quarter and yet the bad debt expense for the quarter was actually higher than the year earlier number.  So first question is, that seems counterintuitive, maybe you can address that?  Then secondly your full year FFO guidance, I wonder what kind of full year bad debt expense number you’re assuming? I’m assuming in your same store NOI, kind of a related point, I’m assuming in the same store NOI definition that that hasn’t changed and it still excludes the bad debt expense number?
David J. Oakes: That’s correct on your final point in terms of bad debt being out of same store NOI not because we’re trying to hide anything but just because in terms of providing a number that tries to be as comparable as possible between the periods given all the timing issues with bad debt where we’re still suffering today from certain of the 2008 bankruptcies, we do exclude that from the same store NOI calculation but try to show you all the details possible in that. Traditionally, we would expect to see receivables actually go up in the first quarter now that we are getting our TAM bills out to tenants and our true ups out to tenants earlier in the year than was historically the case and so you’re billing more with less time for the tenants to respond to that so we would naturally expect receivables to go up on probably peak in the first quarter so we were pleased to see that that balance did not go up as much as we would have thought even though we got the bills out in the first quarter. In fact, we saw those receivables go down.  What Dan was exactly referring to was between February and March so not exactly quarter periods that you get to see but an important improvement in terms of us managing this on a real time basis.  So I think some encouraging signs on the accounts receivable side both based on what’s happening in the world overall and the improvement there in some cases.  Secondly, based on the extreme efforts of our accounting and collection department in getting everything that we can. Bad debt expense for the quarter was in line with what we budgeted for the year depending on what exactly you’re using as your denominator.  The ways we look at it where we also include the joint venture portfolio internally, you’re going to be between 1.5 and 1.75% of the total revenue figures so that’s where we were for the quarter and that’s where we expect to be for the year. There are some longer term items that factor in to that related to some of the bigger bankruptcies where we’re just getting to the point in those long term liquidations where we find out the answer to what some of those claims are and then there’s some of it that’s just directly related to the continued struggles that we still see with some of the small shop tenants within the portfolio that also impact that number.
Jim Sullivan: So in the FFO guidance, the 1.5 to 1.75 is kind of the number we should be using?
David J. Oakes: That’s correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carol Kemple – Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: What was your spread in the quarter between occupied space and leased space?
David J. Oakes: Between occupied and leased, about 280 basis points.  We had a great number of deals done that obviously haven’t opened or commence rent paying but that’s a positive obviously.
Carol Kemple: Who of your small shop tenants is looking for more space in this environment?
Paul W. Freddo: It’s a good mix.  Our small shop space, not a lot of nationals other than some of our lifestyle centers so a lot of moms and pops and local retailers.  But, what we are seeing is a significant pick up again in the franchise business which dropped off dramatically in the last year and a half.  So the most positive sign in the small shop space is clearly coming through the franchises whether it’s the food guys such as Subway or UPS is a big one, so we’re seeing much more pick up in the franchise business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Paul, the bankruptcy environment, how would you characterize that today?
Paul W. Freddo: Certainly much better than we viewed it a year ago Rich, all of us.  I talked before about maintaining a locks list and keeping tabs on those tenants, especially with the high exposure to the company.  That list is greatly reduced.  It’s just a much better environment.  We saw the office category come through the fourth quarter with the capital events which was great news.  Borders even recently had a capital event and it’s still a brick and mortar video store, books would still be the most challenge but it’s just a much improved environment obviously.
Rich Moore: It seems to me that it’s unusually good, is that accurate you think?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, we were pleasantly surprised.  I don’t want to have you believe that we thought it was going to be as good as it turned out to be but yes, it is surprisingly good and that’s a good sign for all of us obviously.
Rich Moore: Then the $1.7 million of litigation expense could you guys give us an update on what’s going on there?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We provide disclosure in the public filings about the couple larger cases.  It’s obviously sensitive matters, whenever there’s litigation so I apologize that we can’t say too much.  But, we continue to be involved in a few cases, most of which have been reflected in the press and we continue to have to spend some amount of capital on defending those and at the end of the day some verdict comes across.  There was one big one late in 2008 that was against us, there have been others historically that have been in our favor but we try to separate off the litigation costs both on an ongoing basis until we know what that final results is.  But it is an absolute expense that continues to show up to operate this business especially in tougher economic times.
Rich Moore: Does that sort of continue Dave at that kind of run rate do you figure for the foreseeable future?
David J. Oakes: For the near term I think you’re going to continue to see litigation expenses at least somewhat around that level.  We try to be smart about it in terms of being as careful as possible with our spending but the reality is we have to defend ourselves in these cases.
Rich Moore: Last thing guys, if you think of your prime portfolio as about 80% of your NOI, you probably have $1 billion or so of assets that are undesirable I guess.  Does the $150 million seem a bit tepid for dispositions?  I mean, is this a seven or eight year program that you’re thinking of with dispositions?
David J. Oakes: Well in terms of the volume I think we’re trying to outline what we can get done and what we can’t get done on terms we think are appropriate.  We prioritize them on that sales pool what’s more important to get done sooner versus later.  We do want to continue to lower the size of that non-prime pool but that happens a couple of ways.  The most obvious way and potentially easiest way although our disposition team might not agree with that is the sale of those assets. It’s a tough process, it’s a long process but we’ve been able to make progress there.  But also as Paul talked about earlier, the redevelopment efforts the opportunities to really rethink about some of these projects in some cases could also help move non-prime assets to prime and so it doesn’t need to be a pure liquidation of that entire pool but increasing the focus on prime is crucial and the asset sales part is a big part of it. We moved from an environment last year where the large transactions were absolutely not possible, today we continue to evaluate that whether selling assets on a one off basis is either the only or even the best way to transact or is even the best way to transact or if there is an opportunity to do something larger and accelerate that progress.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You’re point Rich is a good one because at the time we put together our model there really was no opportunity for large scale portfolio sales.  That market has changed.  If it continues to provide an opportunity for us we would want to take advantage of it and that number could increase if the market gives us the opportunity to do so.  But, at the time we were looking at the $150 million we were doing $5 to $10 million deals and doing 50 of those a year and no one was looking at a transaction anywhere near the size of $100 million, let alone a $200 million transaction.  As those opportunities present themselves and we have seen a few potential opportunities, we are going to pursue those and it if it’s in the best interest for us to execute we will.
Rich Moore: Just extending that for a second, if there is truly $1 billion of sort of non-prime assets and maybe more if you could the joint ventures, is any of that or I guess the better question is how much of that Dave would you consider redevelopment?  I mean is 20% to 30% of that redevelopable?
David J. Oakes: That’s probably too high on that percentage Rich but as I mentioned earlier we are just really getting in to this.  Time will tell as we continue to have these discussions with the retailers, see where their needs are and what their demands are and we’ll be able to give you a better number going forward.  But right now that sounds high to say that much of that non-prime portfolio would be appropriate for the redevelopment pool.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Ultimately, that redevelopment portfolio is going to be defined by the tenant interest.  One of the reasons why we’ve become so focused on it is because tenants have come back to us and are talking about markets where we are absolutely certain that nothing new is going to be built.  So if you have an existing asset with expansion possibilities on an entitled site with improvements already in place, it’s going to create a unique opportunity for us to expand a center and it’s also going to create a unique opportunity for a tenant to enter a market that really the barriers to entry are extremely high.  We’re going to have to follow the tenant market with that because they ultimately will tell us where they want to be and that will define what the redevelopment opportunity truly is.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Harris – Broadpoint Gleacher.
David Harris: Are there any rent relief agreements still in place or are they largely burnt off?
Paul W. Freddo: No, we’re seeing very little in terms of requests today and I don’t believe we’ve even granted one over the course of 2010 first quarter.  It’s a problem that has gone away for the moment.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: [Inaudible] last summer so some of that will still be in place.
David Harris: They were typically 12 months?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, we limited them to a year or less.
David Harris: Dan, if I remember a conversation you and I had about a couple of years ago when you had just come back from a tour of Asia and Europe and you were enthused about the exciting experiences of shopping in many of those [inaudible] compared to what we have here in the United States, is there really any way to express that today?  I mean I guess what that means is looking at smaller local tenants with perhaps less credit standing than taking the big guy selling the me too product that makes the shopping experience a very homogenous experience in the US compared to those other locals?
David J. Oakes: It’s a great question and I wish I had good news for you in that regard but I really don’t.  If you really look at US retail today it still is not nearly as exciting as our foreign competitors.  One of the things that came out in the research report that I mentioned was the fact that we are really operating the local entrepreneurial retailer that dominates European and even in Brazil, dominates the scene there, we’re really operating those folks out of the business either through our hours of operation or our expense structures or the unavailability of capital for them to invest in inventory or even new prototypes. So we’re very fortunate, we had a situation here this past week where we had a new tenant concept come in to meet with us and Paul and I were commenting on that is the first time that has happened in about three years.  Usually they all stop here because of the size of the portfolio.  That just tells you that we really don’t have an awful lot of creativity here.  There is much more creativity abroad and I don’t see that changing any time soon and I really don’t see the availability of capital going in to retail R&D today. If you really talk to the existing tenants who have the best availability or capital, particularly the nationals they really don’t feel comfortable right now investing in new prototypes.  They just feel the risk profile is not appropriate for the market.
David Harris: But don’t you feel there’s a risk long term that rival shopping centers might be prepared to take a risk on less creditworthy established tenants and you might lose market share overtime?  I realize that’s not the priority now, you’ve got to fill the space available and get the best credit but longer term it’s a sort of health of the industry issue isn’t it?
David J. Oakes: I think that’s true and it’s certainly something to monitor but keep in mind the real estate expenses for a retailer as a percentage of the total expenses is really relatively nominal.  We could not wake up one day and decide that we wanted to be an incubator for great retail space and take market share from others because that retailer would still have to find someone to finance their inventory, their construction and run their operation for them all of which today is very, very difficult. I think it’s something to watch, I think it’s something that as an industry it’s concerning, the lack of new and exciting fresh ideas to keep the consumer excited about shopping.  I think that’s part of what all existing retailers and part of what landlords should be focused on.  But, at the same time I think everyone is sort of in the same boat and the homogenous nature of retail in the US seems to be here to stay for a while.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Jeff Donnelly: Just a follow up Dan and certainly the rest of the team too, we’ve had a few people out there talk about the opportunity to be a little bit more speculative and invest in what I think I referred to as busted developments, projects that might be entitled, partially leased or partially built.  Are retailers bringing you those deals?  Do you think that is a deep market?  Is that worth pursuing or do you think it’s going to be a really slim opportunity?
David J. Oakes: Right now I would say it’s a very slim opportunity.  The short answer is yes, retailers are bringing us opportunities but they’re not bringing you anything that you would want to invest in.  The stuff that we’re seeing is extremely distressed, distressed to the point that even if we were to leverage our portfolio we really couldn’t resuscitate it.  It’s really amazing some of the stuff that’s out there and retailers do come to us on a fairly regular basis and say, “Hey, would you guys take a look at this?”  And we do look at things but we’re pretty honest because we certainly don’t want to disappoint the retailers if we say we’re going to get involved, we certainly don’t want to get involved in something and fail. Right now what we’re seeing is the distress level is so high on what’s available out there it’s really not anything you would want to leverage your platform or certainly invest in, either your time or your capital.  The rest of the potential distressed assets that you think you might be able to help just aren’t coming back to the market yet.  Lending institutions are working with landlords, retailers are working with landlords, they’re trying to get some of these assets that are very close to getting over the hump, over the hump. Those assets are not coming to us at this point in time.  But, the things that we’re looking at, some of it brand new, beautiful, $130 to $140 a foot construction that’s going to need a bulldozer to fix and that’s pretty tough to undertake.
Jeff Donnelly: I was going to ask what’s the nature of the distress?  Is it the financial terms that you’ve got to buy in to or is it just the fact that some of these projects are just more in markets or locations that just basically won’t work?
David J. Oakes: It’s interesting because some of them are in good markets and good locations but the design of the center, the layout, the fact that a lot of people put in second or in some cases third story retail in order to help the pro forma and we can note today no matter how good the market is in some of these it will never get leased.  It’s really not deal economics because the tenants will work with you on deal economics number one, the lenders will certainly work with you.  Some of the private developers will clearly just do anything to get themselves off personal guarantees at this point in time but you really can’t work with a physical infrastructure that’s in place. You really have to start from scratch. If that’s going to be the case it’s going to take an enormous amount of additional capital and no one is really in a position where they want to put more capital in.  They just want someone to fix it, they don’t want someone to rebuild it.  Some of these are very good locations but they will not lease, you cannot get tenants to take some of the space that was created and it’s unfortunate but it’s prevalent.
Operator: If there are no further questions, I would like to thank you for your participation in today’s conference.  This concludes the presentation.  You may now disconnect."
11,SITC,4,2010,2011-02-18 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Developers Diversified Realty Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Crystal and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kate Deck, Investor Relations Director. Please proceed, ma'am.
Kate Deck: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you'll hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing & Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and filed with SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release dated February 17, 2011. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at ddr.com. Lastly, we will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call, in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with the company's operations, I'd like to reflect upon the progress made during 2010 and the strategic direction of the company going forward. After surviving the most challenging periods of the late 2008 and 2009, and strategically executing on a plan to address short-term problems with long-term solutions, the last few quarters have presented a period of discovery and reflection. As a management team, we took the opportunity to reflect and debrief on the lessons learned and the obstacles faced during tough times for this company. After much analysis, reflection and strategic planning, management and the board have made a collective commitment to operate this company with significantly less risk going forward, with a key focus on enhancing our operating platform and providing industry-leading transparency and candor. As the economic environment improves and the appetite for risk grows, we will remain prudent in our operational execution and capital allocation plan and maintain our singular focus on long-term value creation for our shareholders. We understand the responsibility for which we are charged. To steward shareholders capital in a responsible and strategic manner and we'll continue to do so with a heightened sense of responsibility and respect for the market in which we operate. A significant focus in 2010 was to build back credibility in the market. As a management team, we know the only way to do so is to deliver on what we say we're going to do. In January of 2010, we issued written guidance with several operational and financial goals. I'm proud to say that one year later, we met or exceeded the majority of our goals. In 2010, we plan to achieve flat to slightly positive same-store NOI compared to 2009. A prediction that raised many eyebrows at that time given the operating environment and for good reason. At year end 2010, however, we met that target with the full year same-store NOI of positive 1.1% and a positive 3.6% increase for the fourth quarter alone. We set out to increase our portfolio of lease rate by 100 basis points over year-end 2009. By year-end 2010, we realized an increase of 130 basis points over 2009 and reached 92.3%. We set out to increase ancillary income by 17%. At year end, we realized an increase of 22%, exceeding our target by approximately $2 million. We set out to sell $150 million of non-prime assets to reduce our exposure to underperforming property and improve the overall quality of our prime portfolio. At year end, we sold $250 million net of joint venture interests, exceeding our goal by $100 million and highlighting our commitment to actively manage our portfolio and emphasizing our determination to continually improve asset quality. Moreover, our execution of attractively priced and strategic asset sales, exceeding budget, underscores our focus to navigate market opportunities for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, even if those decisions put pressure on short-term FFO results. We set a goal to reduce total consolidated outstanding indebtedness to $4.4 billion by year-end 2010. At year end, our total consolidated outstanding indebtedness was $4.3 billion, beating our target by nearly $100 million. Additionally, our goal was to reduce pro-rata debt to EBITDA to the mid-8x range and we ended the year in nearly a half turn lower at 8.1x. We set out to take advantage of opportunistic capital raising, resulting in $2.9 billion of a variety of capital raised, representing significant and important steps towards enhancing overall liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. Our 2010 results are indicative of a strong operating platform that is performing at a very high level, and an economic backdrop that shows signs of improving fundamentals. In our business, platform matters greatly. As shopping center landlords, we all like to ascribe the value of our respective portfolios based on demographic analysis and market positioning. However, many of us own the same or very similar product in the same or very similar markets. And while DDR and many of our highly regarded peers have successfully bounced off the bottom with gains in occupancy and same-store NOI, some are still searching for the floor. There are many short-term variables as to why one portfolio may be performing differently than another, but one aspect that is consistently overlooked and underappreciated over the long-term is the quality of the operating platform. Shopping centers do not operate themselves. Rather, they require a significant and consistent level of active management and industry engagement. A high-quality operating platform can grow net operating income and increase occupancy while fundamentals remain challenging. A high-quality operating platform is able to attract talent and drive organizational advancement amid market dislocations. A high-quality operating platform can be leaned upon when times are tough and drives outperformance when the markets permits. And most of importantly, a high-quality operating platform doesn't need to rely upon financial engineering as a means to cloud portfolio performance results. We will continue to invest in our operating platform and promote a corporate culture that supports excellence in execution and recognizes success as we believe this philosophy will continue to attract industry talent, reward long-term shareholders and further enhance the quality and performance of our assets individually and our company collectively. I will now turn the call over to Paul who will provide greater detail on portfolio operations in the retail environment. After Paul, David will discuss financial results and balance sheet initiatives. Paul?
Paul Freddo: Thanks, Dan. Leasing momentum and deal velocity remained strong during the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we completed 161 new leases for 976,000 square feet and 235 renewals for 1.6 million square feet. For the year, we completed the 738 new leases or 4.4 million square feet and 1,060 renewals for 6.8 million square feet. This full year level of activity represents a company record for total deals on both a count and square footage basis, despite a smaller portfolio than in the past few years. The fourth quarter improvement of 3.6% in same-store NOI, which Dan mentioned, is a direct result of this extremely high level of leasing activity, which has been sustained for several quarters. We are now seeing some of the deals we've been talking about coming online and that dynamic will continue. Our lease occupancy rate increased to 92.3%, which exceeded guidance from last January by 30 basis points. We expect to increase the lease rate by another 100 basis points by year-end 2011. Of this 92.3% lease occupancy rate, approximately 170 basis points represents leases which have been fully executed, but are not yet open or paying rent. These tenants will open and commence paying rent throughout 2011, but will not fully annualize until 2012. For 2011, these openings will produce $9.7 million in revenue for the partial year. And when annualized in 2012, will produce $15.1 million in revenue.  These figures represent only DDR share of the total revenue. For the third consecutive quarter, we achieved positive leasing spreads for both new leases and renewals. As noted in our release, spreads for new deals were positive 8.3% and renewal spreads were positive 4.8%, resulting in a combined spread of positive 5.4%. This compares very favorably to the negative 3.4% for the year-end 2009. As supply continues to be absorbed and with limited space coming online, retailers, especially in the anchor and junior anchor categories, are continuing to make deals to meet their store opening plans for 2011 and 2012. We expect the continued demand and increased competition for space to continue to drive rental rate growth. Regarding our box leasing efforts in the fourth quarter, we signed 10 new leases for 302,000 square feet. This brings our 2010 box leasing volumes to almost 2.9 million square feet, and we expect this momentum to continue. To date, we have activity on 80% of the space vacated by bankrupt retailers, including 49% sold or leased, 9% at-lease and 22% in LOI negotiations. The other 20% of the space was limited activity is comprised of 20 boxes, totaling 715,000 square feet. We anticipate positive momentum on approximately half of those remaining boxes, many of which are still high quality, but consistent with past lease-up experience, the final 10% will be more difficult and will require more creative solutions. We continue during the quarter to make deals with strong retailers including Dick's Sporting Goods, Bed Bath & Beyond, hhgregg, buybuy Baby, Jo-Ann Fabrics and Ross Dress for Less. As you know, Borders filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Wednesday of this week. We currently have nine locations, aggregating 0.2% of our total portfolio of GLA and 0.4% of our pro-rata annual base rent. Seven of these are wholly-owned and the other two were held in joint venture. We currently expect five of the nine to be rejected and vacated by the end of April. We've been actively marketing the Borders locations in anticipation of a bankruptcy filing and have strong indications of interest on several locations. As you know, we've had quite a bit of experience leasing vacant bankrupt boxes recently and are very well equipped to handle this immaterial bump in the road.  Additionally, based on improvement throughout the year and holiday sales results, we are not anticipating any other material bankruptcies in the near term. Turning to International. Our portfolio in Brazil continues to perform well, with a leased rate of 97.4%, same-store NOI growth of 16%, positive new deal spreads of 13% and positive renewal spreads of 22%. The expansion of Parque Dom Pedro opened in November, on schedule and on budget. This 58,000 square foot expansion of our largest asset in Brazil and the largest enclosed mall in South America is fully leased and expected to generate an additional $2.6 million of annual rental revenue, with an unlevered stabilized yield on the incremental dollars invested of 28%. We also have three developments underway that will be funded by proceeds from the recent IPO, which David will discuss in more detail. Unlevered stabilized returns on the those developments are expected to be in the mid-teens. Finally, as we have indicated on prior calls, we continue to be very selective with domestic development spending. The capital that we are spending is to get tenants opened and operating in existing developments. With regard to our domestic redevelopment initiative, we have identified several viable projects with attractive returns and will provide more detail on this strategy at Investor Day. I will now turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Beginning with our financial results. Operating FFO was $0.27 per share for the fourth quarter. Including certain non-operating, primarily non-cash net charges, FFO was a loss of $0.17 for the quarter. The charges included a $22 million non-cash charge related to a development project in Norwood, Massachusetts and a $50 million income tax expense due to the establishment of a reserve against certain deferred tax assets, within our taxable REIT subsidiary. The Norwood charge is a result of our decision no longer pay ground rent on the only development project we have that sits on unowned land. The project was inherited when we purchased the JDN portfolio in 2003. This will result in a cash savings of approximately $1 million annually that have previously been expensed. In January, we issued FFO guidance of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes same-store NOI growth of 3%, $100 million of non-prime operating asset sales with net proceeds reinvested into acquisitions, LIBOR increasing to 1% and no major capital raising activity. While this range is larger than our historic guidance, we want them to be especially careful to make sure that it was highly achievable and that we provided sufficient cushion to include unforeseen tenant bankruptcies and interest rate increases and to allow for flexibility to accelerate refinancing activity or continue as a net seller of assets as market pricing continues to escalate. Our primary goal remains value creation for shareholders, and we will not sacrifice that for short-term FFO outperformance. We do expect to return to FFO per share growth in the near term, but we will not compromise our asset value or our balance sheet in order to achieve it. We will keep you updated at least quarterly on our progress towards this guidance range. While our expected success in leasing financing and investing may cause reason to believe that our results for 2011 should be meaningfully higher than 2010, the major factor that will offset this is increased interest expense. As a result of recent duration extension, we have lowered our overall risk profile, but we have also increased interest expense. In 2010, we replaced approximately $1.3 billion of debt at a 2.6% higher average interest rate. Which translates to a $34 million increase in interest expense, or approximately $0.13 per share. The main drivers are 200 basis points spread increase on the revolver, higher interest expense relating to longer-term unsecured notes, the accrual of interest on our new convertible notes and a 5.3% GAAP interest rate instead of the actual interest rate of 1.75%, and budget increases to treasury and LIBOR rates. This impact may be partially offset by paying down debt with free cash flow and refinancing mortgages at lower interest rates. Lenders today are quoting mortgage debt in the high 4% to low 5% range for five-year loans with 60% loan-to-value and upper 5% to lower 6% range for 10-year debt, which considers spread compression but also increased treasuries and swap rates. Our next large debt maturity is the $600 million term loan expiring in February of 2012. We are in regular discussion with the 30 participating banks, many of whom participated in our revolver refinancing in October of last year, and we remain confident in our ability to refinance at least the amount outstanding. We expect to refinance this facility in a higher interest rate than the current rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points, and we'll likely choose to further reduce the size of the term loan. We expect the refinancing will occur late this year. The covenants have already been amended to match our new revolver and are expected to remain consistent. Turning to our 2011 maturities. We have already reduced the $330 million of consolidated debt maturing in 2011 to $230 million by the early repayment of $100 million of 6.9% mortgage debt that was set to mature in April. We used the revolver to repay the loan on the first day we could do so without penalty, but we will refinance three of the four assets with a new seven-year loan at a lower rate in March. The other asset will go to the benefit of our unencumbered asset pool. The remaining $230 million of debt maturing in 2011 will be paid off with free cash flow, asset sale proceeds and additional long-term financings. We also currently have over $600 million available on our $1 billion revolver today. Joint venture debt maturing in 2011 totaled $213 million as of year end, of which our pro-rata share was $64 million. We have already refinanced $21 million of this debt and are currently in the market to refinance much of the remainder. We are also beginning to refinance 2012 JV maturities this year. As Dan mentioned, we reduced total consolidated debt this quarter from $4.4 billion to $4.3 billion, surpassing our goal for the end of the year by almost $100 million. We also reduced pro-rata debt to EBITDA to 8.1x for the fourth quarter, down from 9.3x at the end of the fourth quarter 2009, and down from 10.2x when we started disclosing our calculation in mid-2009. On a consolidated basis, our debt to EBITDA is 7.5x, down from 8.7x in the fourth quarter of 2009. We are pleased with our progress, but we plan to do more and expect this ratio to continue to improve in the future. Most of our bank and bond covenants improved during the quarter including outstanding debt to unappreciated real estate assets, secured debt to total assets and the unencumbered asset test. We are confined with all of our covenants and we will build additional cushion over time. We generated $791 million of proceeds from asset sales in 2010, of which DDR's share was $250 million. This includes $163 million of assets sold in the fourth quarter. And this included a dark Blockbuster location and dark CDF location, a former Circuit City, that we re-tenanted a small market mall and various small strip centers. We currently have $40 million of additional assets under contract, all wholly owned by DDR. We continue to focus on selling those assets that are not part of our prime portfolio, including non-income producing or negative income producing assets. And in 2010, we sold approximately $54 million of non-income-producing assets of which over $34 million is DDR's share. These sales actually enhanced our NOI due to the removal of property operating and real estate tax expenses. As we mentioned in the guidance press release in early January, we expect to use the proceeds from dispositions for a strategic and opportunistic investments. In January, we acquired our JV partners 50% interest in high-quality prime power center anchored by a recently expanded Super Walmart, Home Depot, Kohl's and Cinemark. The asset was simultaneously refinanced to an 11-year loan on an interest rate more than 30 basis points lower than the prior loan. We have a pipeline of additional acquisition opportunities that we are carefully and strategically reviewing. We believe that we will miss many opportunities due to our stringent review process, careful discipline on informational advantage due to tenant relationships. But we've calculated investments that we do make will improve portfolio quality, covenants, FFO per share and ultimately, shareholder value. We continue to be very focused on communication and transparency with all three rating agencies in order to return to a consensus investment grade credit rating. In 2010, we executed upon numerous transactions which give our rating agencies additional comfort and service catalyst for positive action. And we are confident that our progress will be recognized in some manner this year. Turning now to the dividend. Which has increased 100% to $0.04 for the first quarter of 2011. We continue to maintain a low payout policy in order to provide free cash flow to eliminate debt or reinvest in assets. This is under the regular review by management and our board, and we still believe that a relatively conservative payout policy makes the most sense while we continue to prioritize balance sheet improvement. As announced earlier this month, our joint venture, Sonae Sierra Brasil, completed an IPO in the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange in early February. Total proceeds from the IPO of BRL 585 million or approximately USD $261 million, will be used primarily for new development and redevelopment or expansion of our existing centers. We now own approximately 25 million shares for a 34% stake in the company, and have three of the seven board seats. Part of the proceeds were also used to repay a $45 million loan from the Sonae Sierra Brasil's parent company, of which we are a 50% owner. Our shares are locked up for six months and we have no plans to sell after that, but we would always prefer liquidity versus illiquidity in a venture. We are pleased that through the IPO, we are still able to capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunity that Sonae Sierra Brasil has in Brazil, while keeping our ownership interest in a comfortable range and ensuring the growth is funded through local equity rather than international debt. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for his closing remarks.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, David, and just before closing our prepared remarks, I'd like to remind you of our Investor Day being held on March 7 in New York. We will have a detailed presentation by senior management outlining the objectives of our five-year strategic plan and providing more detail on the remaining vacancy within the portfolio, income generated from leased but unoccupied space, the prime portfolio, acquisition and disposition opportunities, as well as redevelopment and development initiatives. We look forward to seeing you in New York and sharing our outlook with you in greater detail. In the meantime, we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have today. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy: Paul, I'm just trying to reconcile the numbers that you've provided around the leases executed, but not yet open. What was your physical occupancy at year end? And in your guidance, you're forecasting 100 basis point rise in the leased rate. What is your projection for an increase in physical occupancy by year-end 2011?
Paul Freddo: What I was laying out, Christy, I think it's a great question because I read several reports, which really are all over the place on this physical occupancy, I want to make sure we're all on the same page, different interpretations of our occupancy numbers. That's why we went out to the length to point out the 170 basis points of signs but unopened. That's the upside spread. In our 92.3%, as I mentioned, 170 basis points represents the fully executed leases. And in the script, obviously, I mentioned, the anticipated upside in rent from those deals. It's a wider spread that we've historically had and we've talked in the past about a 50 to 100 basis points spread between leased rate and signed but unopened. That is down slightly from where it were in the fourth quarter and that's because we opened about 1 million plus square feet of space in the fourth quarter. We're going to see that 170 basis points -- I think it's going to remain pretty constant for the next year or so because of the strong volume of deals. And as we open, we'll see it level off a little bit more as store openings get more in line with lease signings, but we're going to consistently see something wider than our historic norm when you talk about the leased rate versus the rent paying.
Christy McElroy: Okay, so given the progress that you expect to make on leasing this year, if that spread remains fairly constant there's probably further upside from occupancy upside in 2012 then?
Paul Freddo: Absolutely.
Christy McElroy: And then can you disclose the cap rates on the income-producing assets that you sold in the fourth quarter, both wholly owned and in the JV? And what's your expectation for cap rates on the asset sales in 2011?
Paul Freddo: We did have one prime asset in the joint venture that was included in the fourth quarter asset sales. And so we ended up with an average cap rate in the low- to mid-7% range, as that one asset pulled it down a bit versus the non-prime assets that were in the 8% to 9% range. In our guidance for 2011 for asset sales we've assumed 100% non-prime assets sales at a cap rate of approximately 9%.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: Dan, this might be a question for the Investor Day, but can you try to put some context around just the size of the non-prime portfolio and maybe the expected timing of the sell down? I mean, should we think of it as sort of $700 million to $1 billion and probably three to four years to sort of rationalize it?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, in total, about $750 million worth of assets. Some of the assets though, Jay, because of the momentum that we're seeing in the market that were previously designated as non-prime then because of tenant interest and redevelopment opportunities, are becoming prime. And we will discuss that in detail at Investor Day. Whether all of them get sold within the three to four-year period of time is really going to be up to the market. We have a number of them on the market currently. As David said, we're looking at cap rates for 2011 at about a nine cap. But as you know, cap rates continue to compress as there is an abundance of capital that is available out there looking for yield. And which is why the last two years, we have surpassed our budgeted amount of asset sales. And I suspect that might happen again this year as well. So I think we're somewhere in that $700 million, $750 million range and our goal would be not necessarily to have all those assets sold in our five-year strategic plan by 2015, but we're really looking at it from an NOI participation, that is a NOI participation rate and what we'd like to have is the NOI of this company over 90% of it to come from the prime portfolio by 2015. And that's how we're really gauging the difference between the two buckets. So we're up from 80% to about 83.5% of our current NOI from the prime portfolio and over the next number of years, we'd like to get that up to 90% and that's part of our five-year strategic plan that we will discuss in detail on Investor Day.
Jonathan Habermann: And then separate but related, on those, the land bank or the development projects primarily on hold, are those -- as you think about the cycle coming back and development returning, is that the land bank you want to have as you position yourself for the next phase of the cycle? Or do you think that the land bank will be part of the disposition process as well and then you'll have to rebuild your pipeline?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, it's going to be a combination of both. Right now, clearly, there are parcels of land in our land bank that we will not develop, that the cycle has passed them by and retailer interest is just not there. However, we do have some of the land with the best way to monetize that land may very well be to develop and get a decent incremental return on additional dollars that we put in. And with the pressure that the tenants are in order to grow, the fact that the space is disappearing at a fairly rapid rate, it is going to put some more interest into the development bucket. And some of the land that we currently had envisioned selling and monetizing just as vacant land, I suspect we, absolutely, will develop. But there will be a significant portion of the land that we will be dispose of without having to invest any incremental development dollars.
David Oakes: And overall, we're still closer to land and construction in progress representing about 10% of our consolidated balance sheet. Although that's come down somewhat from maybe the high single digits, and we'd like to see that more in the 5% range.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: I was just wondering is Blockbuster current under our lease payments?
Paul Freddo: They did not pay February, Craig, and it's my understanding they haven't paid anyone. Oh, I'm sorry, I was speaking to Borders, Craig. Blockbuster is current and is still in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and required to pay those rents. So they are current.
Craig Schmidt: So I guess, just in a broader show, when a company enters bankruptcy, they need to pay the rents first, right?
Paul Freddo: That's opposed to fishing rent. They are absolutely required to pay that, yes.
Craig Schmidt: And if they don't, does that push them to a Chapter 7 or what would be the next course of action?
Paul Freddo: I'm not sure exactly what the legal ramifications are. David, do you want to...
David Oakes: When you think about the bankruptcy process and representing the bankruptcy estate, the goal of the court is to maximize value for that estate. And so rent payments are an important part of that. So while we often see a tenant skip one month right before they declare, once they're in bankruptcy, it's important because, otherwise, the landlord gets in a much stronger position to default and potentially impair the value that the bankruptcy has taken and can recognize itself. While we often see one month of missed payments right before or pre-petition, after bankruptcy, generally, the stores are quite good at paying rent because it's an important priority payment that they're making at that point.
Daniel Hurwitz: The landlords and the vendors on a post-petition basis get a priority payment, because the intent there is obviously to enhance, as David said, as much value as possible and if assuming for the sake of argument, they didn't reject our store, that means that they obviously are either making money or anticipate making money in the future. so you have to pay your landlords to operate and have to pay your vendors to ship goods. So we get a priority payment in a post-petition claim.
Craig Schmidt: I know you have a big exposure in Georgia and Florida. And we're hearing particularly in Georgia that things are starting to turn around. Are you experiencing that?
Paul Freddo: We are, Craig. We're seeing some pickup in both, but the land on which we have a high concentration is clearly a little ahead of the curve as with respect to Florida, but we are seeing a pickup.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wigginton with DISCERN.
David Wigginton: With respect to your current unleased portion of your portfolio of 100 basis points, what percentage of that space can you give us an idea has been vacant for more than a year? And I guess as you look at your expected lease-up of about 300 basis points of your long-term average, what portion of that expected lease-up that do you think or estimate would incorp with the space that has been vacant for more than a year?
Daniel Hurwitz: I want to wing it on as percent, but there's a significant amount in getting to it yet. It's going to be north 50%, anyway, David, that's going to be involved in getting up to the full, the 95-plus. The first part of your question, I'm not sure I -- What was the question again?
David Wigginton: The unleased portion of our portfolio, roughly 100 basis points, what percent of that space has been vacant for more than a year?
Daniel Hurwitz: Again, significant percentage of it.
Paul Freddo: There'll be a large percentage, Dave, because we have about 300 basis points to get us to the historic average and then we have about 500 basis points of structural vacancy, if you will, that some of which has been vacant for a very, very long time and we don't anticipate will get leased. So of the 800 basis points that's a target to get you to 100%, 500 basis points of the 800 basis points will stay vacant forever.
David Wigginton: As we think about the lease-up, I've been focusing on that 300 basis points and looking quite of what you achieved in 2010 with respect to the lease spaces that have been vacant for more than a year, it seems like the rents are quite a bit lower than the average new and renewals that you're signing at this point. How big of an impact does that have on ..?
Paul Freddo: Keep in mind, David, this is earning zero and quite a bit of it has been earning zero or costing us money with taxes, cam [ph], et cetera for the last couple of years. So the impact is positive and the trend in the rent is clearly positive. It's not something we're looking at in terms of what's the rent in 2011 versus a space has been vacant for two and a half years or more. This is all positive, it's all incremental and the trend we're seeing is clearly positive on almost a quarter-to-quarter basis. As we talked about several times before, the demand, the competition for space, the sense of urgency we're seeing from retailers, that is doing nothing, but heating up and that's all good news.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Going back to the development question. If you look back over the -- let's say, a little past 12 months or so, how's the rent trends has been as far as the gap where retailers are willing to pay the rents that make new deals pencil? Is that gap pretty narrow right now where we could see development start sooner? Or is it still pretty wide and therefore, we're not still too soon to see development resume in a material way?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's still pretty wide. And I don't think we'll see development resume in a material way. There's two major aspects, obviously, in our development projects. There is what tenants will pay and we're still in the middle teens, if not higher, away from where we need tenants to be to justify investing additional capital into development projects. But there's also land costs. And if you're looking for new sites today, and we have seen some, obviously, coming to the house, and we've looked at them. Land costs still are also not where they need to be. And in our particular sector, land costs run about 30% of the total cost of the project. So they need to come down dramatically and rents need to go up dramatically in order for new development or new sites to become of interest to us. Now we do own some land, obviously, and that does give us the ability to monetize that land if, in fact, tenants can justify the incremental dollars if they're willing to pay us the rent to justify the incremental dollars to put into those sites. But overall, the gap is still very healthy and pretty wide. And we think it will narrow, we think it will narrow in 2011 as tenants get more and more concerned about delivering on 2012 open to buys. But to be honest with you, by then, it's going to be too late to deliver 2012 open to buy and you're going to be looking at 2013 and 2014.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just going to Brazil, how much of your long-term interest there is -- or your comments about retaining your stake? How much of that is driven by your enthusiasm for Brazil versus potential repatriation issues?
Paul Freddo: It's really the opportunity we see in Brazil, much more so than the friction of taxes getting back. This is not waiting on the administration for a tax holiday on getting capital back. It's more driven by the incredible opportunity that we see down there. And even a little bit of capital that we did take back, we were able to do pretty efficiently through restructure.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: Turning back to asset sales for a second. In the fourth quarter, you sold wholly-owned, as well as a handful of joint venture assets from a number of different ventures. Looking at the JV sales going forward, are we more likely to see kind of the same sort of smattering across the board, across the ventures? Or do you think there's a possibility of just seeing a whole venture go away at one time?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's certainly possible. In general, this pricing has come back as significantly as it has. Some of our partners, along with ourselves, are looking favorable at that as an asset, the time and its life cycle where we don't think there's enough NOI outside to counter the fact that cap rates are pretty darn close to where they were at the peak. And so possible that you see additional asset sales among the ventures. But for the most part, the sales efforts for us are focusing on the non-prime assets in our guidance. To our joint ventures it's the same on that. So selectively, you might see a few more assets of little higher quality sold, but the overwhelming majority of what you're likely to see is the non-prime stuff. Don't think it's likely, certainly that you would see any of the large ventures go away. But we are continuing to try to rationalize some of the smaller ventures.
Michael Mueller: And then can you talk a little bit about what all the leasing TI, leasing commission and the CapEx expectations over the next couple of years compared to, say, what you put up in 2010?
Paul Freddo: We see it continuing to decrease, Michael, That's really been the trend. We've had a couple of deals in the fourth quarter that were high-cost deals such as the Anthropologie deal, but that's been a trend we've been very focused on and driving better deals in terms of TI. So we do not see any improvement over this -- I mean, any increase in that cost to us over the next couple of years.
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, 2010 should probably be the peak there. You're going to see, based on our expectation, continued very strong leasing volume. But just given that we don't have the inventory of available space that we once had, you probably won't see it at the absolute peak levels that existed in 2010. Also, as the environment has improved, we've been put in an incrementally stronger position to put less capital into transactions. So while we were never overly aggressive in effectively lending the tenants just have them pay us a little higher rent, as the leverage have shifted a bit, I think we're in an even stronger position to reduce those expenses on a per square-foot basis. And so still well above the historic average sort of the $30 million to $40 million of leasing CapEx that we had in the past. But we'd see 2010 likely as the peak year for leasing CapEx so some declines from that level.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: You also announced in the press release earlier this week about the retirement of Scott Wolstein and they said there would be a charge in the first quarter. How much is that expected to be?
David Oakes: For the terms of his employment contract that was filed in July of 2009, he is entitled for the payment of salary and target bonus through the end of the contract period. That contract period ends at the end of 2012. And that amounts to about $8 million of cash for that salary and bonus. He also owns -- has been granted, over the past several years, about 550,000 shares of stock that would also see accelerated vesting and would also be reflected in a charge that would also be around $8 million. But again, that's stock has already been granted and belongs to him, that's just really the accounting reality of that.
Carol Kemple: So $16 million in total for the quarter?
David Oakes: Something around there is a good estimate.
Carol Kemple: And then in 2011, I think I read that you all expect to use any proceeds from the sale of assets for acquisitions. What are your plans to actually pay down debt to lower debt levels from where they are at this point? Or are you comfortable where they are?
David Oakes: We've guided overall to continued focus on improving the balance sheet, that's going to happen in a few ways. In terms of debt reduction, we've indicated the consolidated debt that ended the year -- ended  2010 at $4.3 billion would be reduced to approximately to $4.1 billion level. So about $200 million of additional consolidated debt reduction. More importantly, in terms of how we're going to lower debt to EBITDA and other important leverage metrics, though, it's going to be the increase in EBITDA. Most of which is highly visible from leases already signed, but not yet rent paying or certainly not yet annualized in terms of their rent paying status. And so we think that EBITDA increases will be a meaningful part of making it clear that the overall leverage profile of DDR is much lower than simply a static or trailing view would be on a debt-to-EBITDA basis.
Carol Kemple: Okay, so this overall, the $200 million will be mostly from free cash flow? Or if you sell more assets than you expect to buy?
David Oakes: The sale of assets, we've talked about the operating asset sales being reinvested into investments or acquisitions. We're also continuing to monetize the non-income-producing assets. So you'll have some proceeds there that could reduce debt. And in fact, be accretive in net reduction of debt because you're eliminating negative EBITDA assets and you're also eliminating interest expense, but also, with the low-dividend payout policy currently in place. We do produce considerable amount of retained cash flow that can go towards debt reduction.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC.
Richard Moore: In 4Q, you had, I think, a $3.2 million separation charge in G&A. And if that's correct, what was that about just out of curiosity?
David Oakes: At the end of the year, we did a restructuring of a number of departments. And came to the determination, quite frankly, that the business was not going to change back to the way it was prior to the recession. And as a result, we felt that in certain areas, we were overstaffed and ended up effectuating termination agreements with approximately 22 different people, five of which were actually members of our executive committee. So it was a determination that the business model had changed. That some of our departments were not properly structured for the ongoing business model that we have employed. And as a result, it was time to make some tough decisions on some very long term and senior employees.
Daniel Hurwitz: The exact severance charge, but I mean the focus was broader than that in terms of eliminating some open positions, eliminating some executive perks, it shouldn't just be our shareholders that have suffered through this. And we made a lot of difficult decisions to lower the expense structure of this company in the fourth quarter.
Richard Moore: So is there any of that continuing into the first quarter? Or is that all taken care of in 4Q?
Daniel Hurwitz: With the exception of the announcements on regarding Scott Wolstein that came out earlier this week, we would believe that it was all reflected in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley: Just wanted to talk a little bit about guidance. David, I know you went through what you assumed in the midpoint of the guidance. But if you look at the low end and the high-end, what are you assuming in terms, firstly, interest rate movements? But secondly, opportunistic capital raisings, which you had mentioned in the guidance release, just at the low end and the high end?
David Oakes: Yes, we obviously run through quite a large number of scenarios in coming up with a range that we think is reasonable and highly achievable and also provides us a considerable amount of flexibility. In thinking about the way we flex interest rates, you could take LIBOR up 200 plus basis points for the entire year and make our interest expense that much higher. We went through scenarios where we took the entirety of the tenants currently in bankruptcy or in our tenant watch list. We removed that income stream from the entire year. And so as we advanced through the year and those eventualities don't play out, we clearly eliminate some of those scenarios. On the other side, in thinking about items that might be short-term dilutive but long-term attractive, we also thought about situations where we might choose to pull forward the refinancing. But our term loan, which is $600 million currently costing us about 1.5%. And said, what if we term that out sooner rather than later then our debt costs would be in the low 5% range for sort of seven-year debt or high 5% range for 10-year debt. So I think we've given ourselves flexibility, should we decide to and should we think it's the right thing for our risk profile -- or the right decision for our risk profile. We've given ourselves the flexibility to pull forward a significant amount of that refinancing activity into 2011 and still come out within this guidance range. But at the same time, meaningfully, lower than the refinancing risk, going forward. So really, just really pulling forward some of that dilution.
Quentin Velleley: So I guess, there's nothing sort of significant in terms of an opportunistic capital raise on either end?
David Oakes: We think it's significant but certainly, nothing different than we've talked about in the past where we continue to stay fit to reach our leverage goals, which are certainly in line with Investment Grade metrics. We do not need additional common equity to replace simply for the purposes of paying down debt.
Quentin Velleley: Just secondly, going back to David's questions on the leasing of the space that's vacant for more than a year and I know you exclude those from the spreads and obviously its incrementally positive to lease up all that space. I'm just wondering if you calculated spreads of the space that was leased, but vacant for more than a year, what would they be roughly?
Daniel Hurwitz: There's really only about 100 basis points decline in those spreads if you include those, Quentin.
Quentin Velleley: Sorry, if you include both together, it would have been down about 100 basis points?
Daniel Hurwitz: That's correct, Quentin.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Just wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing in Florida, particularly your smaller tenants? And has the credit availability situation improved from what you're seeing and are you starting to see net demand from that tenant type?
Paul Freddo: We believe we bottomed Florida and elsewhere in the small shops space. And it's interesting, I just looked at this the other they where we leased about 1.1 million square feet of space that we referred to as small space, which is under 10,000 feet. And we lost that much through expiration. But that's an improvement over where we were in 2009, we've clearly seen improvement in the level of activity. It's still nothing like the good news we continue to talk about in terms of the box space but honestly believe we bottomed. We're actively pursuing one of the areas that I'm very excited about is in the franchise area, and we just you saw yesterday, or the day before were UPS because of that lack of credit availability to small users, it's extending credit directly to potential franchisees. We're hearing that from the franchisors, we think we'll see more activity in that area. It is not going through the roof but we believe we've seen the bottom in 2010 and we'll see gradual improvement in that space.
Daniel Hurwitz: I think it's also safe to assume that over the course of the year as the credit in general becomes more available, that we will start to see some of that flow to the smaller tenants. We're sort of the bottom of the food chain. And recovery that's occurring, obviously, starts at the top of the food chain. And its starting to move its way down. So we are starting to see some movement not just from, as Paul mentioned, from franchisors guaranting the leases of franchisees, but we think that the market will open up a little bit for that local mom and pop who wants to open a store. And again, for us, it's a very small percentage of our portfolio but it could be a meaningful opportunity to create upside for our overall occupancy. So we're watching it very carefully.
Vincent Chao: And just in terms of the interest rate environment and your asset sales. If we start to see an acceleration in interest rate that may be faster that what's currently predicted, would you feel pressured to sell ahead of that? Or would you be okay to just hanging on to the non-core stuff until your cap rates maybe settle out or interest rates maybe settled out a little bit more?
Paul Freddo: We've been more active than anyone else in this space with asset sales. Part of that was because of relatively attractive interest rate environment that existed. Although during part of that period, the lending environment, overall, wasn't participating with positive treasury environment. But I think we really haven't been driving too much on the pure market timing of that and it has been much more where we firmly expected NOI declines and therefore, value declines over time. They were likely to trump any sort of reasonable increase in -- any reasonable sort of change in cap rates. And so couldn't it all say we're agnostic to the interest rate environment. We are trying to push more product out today that we believe to be non-prime. While there is still an attractive lending market, we don't see that attractive lending market changing anytime soon, and so it just continues to be the strategic goal of how do we lower the amount of non-prime assets that we have. And if we see a massive change in interest rates we will adjust the strategy then, but for now we think it makes sense to continue to push forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with Cowen Group.
Michael Gorman: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the 12 non-income-producing assets. I guess, more specifically, what is the NOI drag from those 12 assets, right now? And it sounds like there isn't any assumed dispositions from this segment of the portfolio in the 2011 guidance, is that correct?
David Oakes: There is not.
Michael Gorman: And what's the sort of NOI drag from this 12 properties on the portfolio right now?
David Oakes: You're going to be somewhere -- we go through the gross book value of $100 million range. You're probably in the negative 1% to negative 2% return on those particular assets.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Laura Clark with Green Street Advisors.
Laura Clark: You mentioned that cap rates continues to compress, is this compression taking place across the quality spectrum? And if so, can you give us a range of how cap rates are changing in higher versus lower quality assets today?
David Oakes: The cap rate compression is occurring across the quality spectrum. However, more focused on higher-quality assets. The lower-quality assets is still benefiting from more robust lending environment, more robust, meaning more availability and higher loan to values. But the height of the compression remains on the higher-quality assets where the best assets we have seen, numerous asset trades in the sub-6% cap rate range. The majority of the prime assets we've seen trade are higher than that, but you're certainly in the world of 6% cap rates are very low 7% cap rates when you think about prime assets across pretty much any market in this country that's not just the sexier coastal markets. So I think amid 6%, sort of assumption, is a reasonable one there. So the non-prime assets, it is a wide spread depending on the specific characteristics of those assets that oftentimes are hair on them. On average, we'd say in the 8% to 9% range, but with a broad spread where some of it is even going to be still in the low double-digit but most of it is going to be in that 8% to 9% area.
Daniel Hurwitz: One of the things worth seeing, Laura, is that institutional capital in particular, is tends to be somewhere under allocated in our asset class because we were considered the dangerous asset class in late 2008 and the good portion of 2009. And then after that rash of bankruptcies and when people see what we're doing and others, as far as lease-up is concerned and the strength of our tenants, again, the asset class is proving itself to be somewhat resilient. As a result, people are under allocated in this class and we have enormous amount of capital that is chasing and obviously, putting pressure on cap rates. So as more and more institutional capital gets put out in our sector, you may see a little easing of cap rate environment, but we don't see it happening anytime soon because of that under allocation, and we hear that consistently from a number of investors.
Laura Clark: And what type of buyers are you seeing for your non-prime properties? And has this pool changed or increased over the past few months?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, we're seeing a number of different buyers. It hasn't changed too much except what we are seeing is we're seeing more folks interested. There was a period of time where we would see maybe one bid come in for an asset, maybe two. Now, we're seeing three and four. We're seeing some of the private REITs, we're seeing one-up individuals and there are also other public REITs that have been looking at some of the assets. So the pool of potential buyers is very, very similar. There's just more of them than we've seen in the past year and a half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Wigginton with DISCERN.
David Wigginton: Just a quick follow-up on the convert offering in November. Did the Otto Family participate in that?
Paul Freddo: They did not.
David Wigginton: So just for my own understanding, in the event that there was a conversion down the road, would you be required to issue more equity to enable them to maintain their current position in the company?
Paul Freddo: Absolutely not.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC.
Richard Moore: Could you give us an update on your investment grade progress work? I know that was a big thing for you last quarter to try to get investment grade from the agencies, the three agencies. And I'm curious where you think you stand on that?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's a slow process. We continue to very actively be in front of all three. Pleased that Moody's throughout maintained us at investment grade and actively working with them to make sure they continue to feel quite comfortable there. And very actively in front of S&P and Fitch, as we continue to make progress, highlighting that to them, making sure we understand the hurdles they're thinking about there is no perfect roadmap to exactly how and when you get to an investment-grade rating. But we are having very, very regular dialogue with them. They'll be  at least several of them will be at the Investor Day meeting coming up in a few weeks. And so as they continue to go through their processes, we continue to make it as easy as possible for them to understand how much our credit has improved and is comparable to others that they regard as investment-grade peers.
Richard Moore: Okay, and second thing, I want to make sure I understand what's going on with development. Dave, you were saying that the proceeds of the Brazilian IPO would go toward development and then at the same time, I'm hearing basically that we don't think we're going to do much development. Are there going to be more starts this year? Or are we thinking just finishing what's currently in the pipeline and waiting to see what happens?
David Oakes: Now, there's a differentiation there, Rich, between international development and domestic development. We will be an active developer in Brazil and that is exactly what the capital that was raised will be used for. We have three identified locations that have strong tenant interest. And two of them are under construction, actually all three of them under construction, two of them are far along. And we will continue on the development path. As Paul mentioned in the script, we're looking for unlevered returns in Brazil in the mid-teens on development projects. Where we're limiting development and where we were saying that the pricing was still not compelling either on land or what tenants are willing to pay for rent today is domestically. And we may see one or two starts this year from situations where we already own the land and tenant interest has been renewed, but it will be a very rare occurrence where we're putting any significant capital into development domestically. But we are very excited about our domestic pipeline in brazil. We're very excited by the fact that it's funded. And we have a lot of runway there with the tenants. So we're going to continue to pursue that. At the same time, we're going to be very, very cautious about our domestic development pipeline.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Williams with Brookfield.
Benjamin Williams: I was just curious, I just want to confirm, the total compensation to Scott Wolstein is $16 million?
David Oakes: Well, there's $8 million of cash that represents the salary and target bonus expectation over the next basically, two years. And then there's these accelerated vesting of stock that currently -- that has already been granted over the past several years, that would be valued at current prices at about $8 million.
Benjamin Williams: Could you walk me through how you came up with the $8 million in compensation, just how that all works as far as awards?
David Oakes: It is directly from the contract that Scott executed in the middle of 2009 that it's time was three and a half year contract that went through the end of 2012. And indicated that under a situation of termination without cause, that he would be paid his salary, which was $875,000 plus a target level bonus based on the metrics outlined in the contract through the end of 2012. So he basically got two years remaining of salary and target bonus.
Benjamin Williams: And what were those metrics that essentially drive the bonus, the key drivers that made up the spread between the base and the bonus?
David Oakes: The bonus metrics for Scott were three fold. One, was total shareholder return relative to a peer group. Dan, had three. Scott, just had two. So he was 50/50 between total shareholder return and then the other 50% is other strategic objectives as defined by the board.
Benjamin Williams: I just want to be maybe clear that we've actually discussed it here and we think that its somewhat appalling that Scott's being paid such an excessive amount of money, given the fact that he almost drove the company into bankruptcy. Anyway, I just wanted to express my views on that point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley: Just in terms of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, 8.1x on a pro-rata basis for the fourth quarter, and there's a slight seasonal impact there and if I did the math, I sort of get to about 8.4x, is that roughly right if you remove some of those seasonal items to get in the fourth quarter?
David Oakes: Yes, I think the math in your note was quite reasonable. We're adjusting for a little higher than normal lease termination income that was recognized in the fourth quarter, as well as just the seasonality in the fourth quarter. Then you would get to something in the 8.3x to 8.4x range exactly as you outlined. Our guidance has been the mid-8x and that's how we were thinking about it. But hope we ended up with everything that happened in the fourth quarter in the very low 8x.
Quentin Velleley: And so we shouldn't be surprised to say there's a slight increase in the first quarter of this year?
David Oakes: That's correct. On a quarterly annualized, it really won't show up as much in the first quarter. I mean, the lack of the lease termination income will, but first quarter is still relatively seasonally strong just based on the way that leases often times work. The two trough quarters for us on a typical seasonality, forget the healthy lease-up period we're going through now, that will mute some of that. But in a normal year of flat occupancy, second quarter and third quarter would be the lowest. So you might see a little bit increase through the middle of the year, but then decrease again on a full year year-over-year basis.
Operator: This ends the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the call back to Ms. Kate Deck for closing remarks.
Kate Deck: Thank you all very much for participating in today's call. And we look forward to seeing you or having you participating in the webcast for our Investor Day on March 7.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."
12,SITC,1,2011,2011-04-30 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Developers Diversified Realty Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host to Ms. Kate Deck, Investor Relations Director. Please proceed.
Kate Deck: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO Dan Hurwitz, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Oakes, and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe that such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release dated April 27, 2011. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at ddr.com. Lastly, we will be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. With our earnings released yesterday evening, I don't want to spend too much time rehashing information that you've already reviewed in our release or our supplemental. Rather, I'd like to begin today by highlighting our continued progress with regard to our portfolio management strategy and expand upon the March 31 press release that summarized our first quarter disposition and acquisition activity. While our first quarter transactional activity of $43 million in non-prime asset sales and the acquisition of 2 prime properties from our joint venture partners for $40 million is indicative of our strategy to recycle capital from non-prime into prime, the overall impact on portfolio quality should not go unnoticed. Over the past 5 quarters, we executed over 80 transactions and disposed of more than $800 million of non-prime assets. These assets averaged about 79% leased, and on average were about 100,000 square feet of GLA per asset. The top 3 MSAs in which we sold assets were Atlanta, where we are actively looking to lower our exposure to lower quality assets, Detroit and Buffalo.  Some of the top tenants that occupied these assets by GLA and number of units were Kmart, Tops and Rite Aid. In comparison, our top 3 tenants within the prime portfolio by GLA are Wal-Mart, Target and Kohl's. Moreover, as we sit today on a 7-mile radius, average household income in our prime portfolio is $78,000 per household, population density is over 335,000 people. This represents a 5% to 20% increase over the non-prime assets sold within the past 5 quarters. A 7-mile radius is the appropriate measurement for our asset class given the size of the assets, regional draw and tenant mix. For informational purposes, our prime assets average 305,000 square feet of GLA, which, in addition to the retailers that occupy these assets, confirms that they service a more regional trade area. While our strategy is not simply addition by subtraction, it is important to emphasize the impact of non-prime assets on the calculation of NOI derived from the prime portfolio. As a result, in 2009, our prime portfolio produced 70% of our NOI. By 2010 year end, we achieved 83.3% and today we stand at 86.7%. Just to reiterate, 86.7% of our current NOI comes from prime assets that average over 305,000 square feet of GLA and benefit from average household incomes of $78,000 and average population of over 335,000 people. We are encouraged by the success we have had in upgrading the quality of our portfolio, and note there will be additional opportunities for further enhancement going forward and the significant numbers that I just presented will only get better over time. Given the progress we have made with our balance sheet and the flexibility provided by a more competitive cost of capital, we are carefully underwriting a range of potential acquisition opportunities of prime assets. Our pipeline includes value add, stabilized prime assets, and loan-to-own opportunities that could include the origination of mezzanine debt or the purchase of a senior note at a discount on prime assets. We have successfully sourced attractive opportunities that fit our selective requirements, but remain prudent in our underwriting and bidding practices. As a result, we will likely lose more bids than we win, but we are confident that we can find attractive opportunities to redeploy asset sale proceeds, allowing us to grow and simultaneously reduce operating risk by continuing to improve portfolio quality. This is primarily achievable through a combination of internal and external growth, aggressive dispositions and selective acquisitions, all of which are top of mind on a daily basis. I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thank you, Dan. I'd like to spend a little time today talking about one of the topics getting a lot of attention recently, that being the potential downsizing of retailearnings relea space, but first let me review what was another highly productive quarter. Our domestic leased rate increased by 10 basis points from 92.3% at year end to 92.4%. This represents a 110 basis point increase over the first quarter of 2010. Including Brazil, our blended leased rate is now 92.6%. These results compare favorably to the historic average decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of tenant fallout and lease expirations versus commencements. We remain confident in our ability to achieve an occupancy rate above 93% by year end 2011, consistent with our guidance. Overall, in the first quarter, we completed 428 deals for 2.6 million square feet with a combined spread of 5.4%, up from negative 2.7% in Q1 of '10. These spreads are consistent with our combined spread of 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and are a dramatic improvement from the year ago numbers. As we discussed on Investor Day, spreads are important, but they only tell part of the story. We believe average first year rents on new deals are  a better leading indicator of leasing trends. The average first year rent for all new deals completed in the quarter was $14.17 per square foot, up from $12.80 per square foot in the first quarter of '10. It's important to note that this growth has been achieved with lower CapEx on a per square foot basis for these new deals. I'd now like to take a few minutes to talk about an issue that has been getting quite a bit of attention lately, and that is the trend toward smaller stores and what that means to the landlord community. First, we shouldn't confuse a retailers' ability to operate in smaller stores as a rush to downsize their entire portfolio nor that it can happen overnight. There is a clear distinction between the categories and the retailers that have learned they can be flexible in size and merchandise offering and those that simply have too much space. For the retailers that are exhibiting flexibility, this is not an indication that their entire portfolio is oversized and in need of downsizing to be competitive. What it does show is that they are strong retailers with the ability to compete in a variety of store sizes in a variety of diverse markets. Moreover, the desire for a smaller prototype should not be viewed as a trend toward reducing store count. As industry leasing numbers indicate, demand for new stores is still extremely high even with the changes to prototype and footprint. For those specific retail groups [ph] and categories that do require less space to be productive, it is clearly in our best interest to have them appropriately sized. Greater productivity and smaller stores result in a more successful shopping center with a greater ability to drive brands. But size changes are not always easily achievable. So the question becomes, can and how do we work together to achieve a win-win situation. If the tenant is willing to participate in the cost to downsize and we are left with leasable space, we can usually reach agreements on a business deal, with the result being a more productive retailer and the opportunity for upside on the existing rent for the reduced space as well as upside on the new rent in the residual space. However, if the tenant is not willing to contribute or we are left with unleasable space, we have a very different situation. In that scenario, the things we will take into account include the probability of the retailer relocating, our ability to backfill the space should they do so, and most importantly whether it is a good store for the retailer. First and foremost, retailers are in the retail business and not the real estate business. Retailers do not close successful and profitable stores. It's much easier to lose market share then to gain it and retailers know that better than anyone. Put simply, given today's supply and demand dynamic and tenant thirst for external growth, most retailers feel greater risk in losing market share than landlords do in re-tenanting potentially vacant box space. So to summarize, there's a lot of buzz about retailers downsizing their stores. What is the reality? Would retailers always like to be at their ideal size? Yes. Do we want retailers at their ideal size? Yes, when the deal makes sense. Is their ideal size a constantly moving target, which makes this more difficult? Yes. Is that why relationships and platform matter? Clearly. Are retailers in a position to demand size adjustments in every situation? Absolutely not. Are landlords at risk of losing every oversized space in the near future? Not at all. And are most of our top retailers still growing overall store count and square footage? Absolutely. At the end of the day, it's clearly better for both tenant and landlord to have smaller, more highly productive stores. We like tenants that produce higher sales per square foot, higher profit per square foot and have dramatically increased inventory turn. As a result, we will continue to work with our tenants to achieve the desired end result, but execution relies entirely on the logic of the proposed deal. And I'd now like to turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $63.2 million or $0.24 per share for the 3 months ended March 31, 2011, which is in line with our expectations. Including certain non-operating items, which were net gains this quarter, FFO for the quarter was $89.1 million. The non-operating items relate primarily to gains resulting from acquisitions of our partners' interest in 2 high-quality properties and a noncash gain on the equity derivative instruments relating to the final evaluation of the Otto Family warrants before they were exercised, partially offset by a charge related to the termination agreement exercised with our former executive chairman. I would like to reiterate that in regard to the Otto warrants, the family had the option to exercise their warrants in a cashless fashion, but instead executed a cash exercise where they invested $60 million more into DDR shares and effectively purchased over 3 million shares at the then current market price. We greatly appreciate the continued support and confidence that this highly sophisticated investor has shown in our company and in our direction. At this point in the year, we remain comfortable with our 2011 operating FFO guidance of $0.90 to $1.05 per share and continue to believe that this relatively wide range provides us flexibility to opportunistically accelerate additional refinancing and capital recycling activities. Now, turning to our recent capital markets activity. The first quarter was one of continued progress in our efforts to improve our balance sheet and we are very encouraged by the impact this has had on our cost of capital, most notably our 4.75%, $300 million 7-year bond issuance in early March. Also, we issued 9.5 million shares of common stock pursuant to a forward sale agreement that we executed on March 1. The proceeds received from the equity issuance plus the $60 million from the Otto Family warrants exercise were primarily used to fund the redemption of $180 million of 8% Class G preferred shares. We are aggressively executing our long-term plan to reduce debt to EBITDA and extend duration, and we're please with the reaction from the rating agencies thus far. Just recently, Moody's affirmed our investment grade credit rating and raised its outlook to stable, highlighting our considerable progress in improving our balance sheet and operations. In late February, S&P also raised its outlook on DDR to stable and raised the rating on our senior notes from double-D to double-D plus. We expect progress to continue as we strive for consensus investment grade ratings. During the quarter, our joint venture Sonae Sierra Brasil completed an initial public offering of common shares resulting in gross proceeds of BRL 465 million. While we still own 1/3 of the company and are excited about future prospects, we have dramatically improved DDR's risk profile by creating a liquidity option, plus dramatically improved Sonae Sierra Brasil's access to capital. We have no plans to sell our shares, but we do appreciate the long-term flexibility that comes with such liquidity. We will continue to be very focused on opportunistic refinancing despite minimum near-term maturities and high credit line availability. Based upon the strong market conditions that exist today, we expect to address our 2012 debt well before maturity. The recent improvement in our outlook from the rating agencies lowered the interest cost on our $550 million term loan from LIBOR plus 120 basis points to LIBOR plus 88 basis points, and we expect to make further strides in lowering our overall cost of capital and extending our duration. At March 31, our weighted average debt maturity was 4.2 years, a significant improvement from 3.4 years at the end of last year's first quarter, and nearly all of the $1 billion capacity on our corporate credit facility is available. As you can see, DDR is a much better balanced company and we operate with substantially less risks today than at any time in recent years. This has allowed us to actively pursue external growth opportunities for which we are very enthusiastic. As Dan mentioned earlier, our ability to recycle non-prime asset sale proceeds into prime acquisitions provides us with an opportunity to upgrade the overall quality of our portfolio on a risk-adjusted and balance sheet-positive basis. Some of you may have seen that we recently renewed our aftermarket common equity program for $200 million. We have benefited from the flexibility and efficiency of this program in the past, which is a primary reason that we have renewed it, but currently, we have no plans to use it. We will continue to work aggressively to improve our balance sheet and upgrade the portfolio and at this point, we do not expect any new common equity to be required to accomplish these objectives. One last point before I turn the call back to Dan regarding our Investor Relations function. Recently, we decided that Tim Lordan would assume responsibility for our Investor Relations efforts. As you know, Tim currently oversees our Funds Management Program and many of you know him from his time at The Rouse Company. Kate Deck will continue in her role as Director of Investor Relations, and we expect this change will only enhance analyst and investor coverage of DDR and offer consistent and transparent access and disclosure. This change will allow Francine Glandt to focus her time exclusively on the continued execution of our capital market strategy. We're excited to have Tim take on more responsibility and we look forward to the additional contributions he will bring to the company. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, David, and before turning the call over to questions and answers, I'd like to take a moment to thank those of you who attended our Investor Day in March or listened to the management presentation via the webcast. As a management team, we appreciate your continued support and interest in our story, and hope that you found our presentations to be worthwhile. In addition to the information we shared with you at Investor Day, by now you should have received a copy of our 2010 annual report. We understand that annual reports do not provide the most current financial or operational information given the production timeline. However, we believe the annual report is an important representation of our enterprise, and as such, we took a different approach to our annual report and letter to shareholders than years past. I hope you find the tone and content of the annual report to be consistent with your expectations based upon the direction we have been taking the company in articulating to the market. As always, I look forward to your feedback at your convenience. At this time, we would be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: Paul, thanks for the comments on the potential downsizing issue. I just wanted to question. I mean, we often hear that the increase of the Internet business is the reason for the downsizing. But are there other reasons right now we're seeing this downsizing or should we expect it to be kind of focused on those categories that are doing pretty strong Internet business?
Daniel Hurwitz: I think the focus, Craig, should be on those categories that are impacted by the Internet business, but I'll give you another example that I don't believe is impacted by the Internet business, that would be Old Navy. We aren't seeing a lot of the apparel retailers look to downsize, but that's a clear case of a company that just got way ahead of itself with oversized stores throughout the 90s that the early 2000s, and now they're realizing that there's a smaller prototype that's right for their merchandise mix. But I think in general terms, the focus is on those categories such as the office product guys and electronics where we'll see more of the downsizing.
Craig Schmidt: And in your discussion with retailers, are they remaining focused on margin or market share at this point now, or is there any shift in those 2 priorities?
Daniel Hurwitz: Clearly, both priorities. I mean market share is what's going to drive margin at the end of the day. Interestingly, I think we're seeing some things we've talked a lot over the past year or so about commodity price increases. We're seeing the good retailers maintain and improve their margins, even in light of those price increases. But typically, market share is going to drive margin. Any increased market share will drive margin, Craig. So that's the first focus, but they're both critical to retailers.
Craig Schmidt: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sri Nagarajan from FBR.
Srikanth Nagarajan: I just wanted to follow up on the earlier question and your remarks, Paul, in terms of the oversized retailer and the landlord particularly not in danger of losing space immediately, what are the tenant options today on being oversized? And obviously, as you look at it from a pure analyst perspective, how is it now going to affect overall fundamentals in rent outlooks in the future?
Paul Freddo: Well, one of the key points I was trying to make was that it is not as easy as it seems, and that's one of the reasons we were emphasizing it on today's call. A couple of years ago, or let's go back even a little further when development was plentiful, that's an easier environment within which to thread in if you're the retailer, the relocation to a competing site, we can now get our prototype at a fair rent. That and as I mentioned on the call, the dynamic of no new development and available space being absorbed quite quickly doesn't give them a lot of options. So the reality is that we're going to try to work together because it's in both of our best interests, but if we can't, we are expecting that they will take their option, renew in their current size and we're seeing that in quite a few examples where there's no effective way to do it, they're not going to close the store, they don't have an alternative, and that's what it really gets down to. Look, it's up to us to use our best judgment to figure out exactly what the best situation is with each situation and decide which way we're going with it, but they're not going to close stores that are good even if they can't get to their perfect size. That's really the point.
Daniel Hurwitz: I think that's probably the most important point, is that retailers today in particular can't afford to close profitable stores for a variety of different reasons. Number one is you have to replace the volume and if you don't replace the volume in some way, the impact on your indirect charges and the profitability of the other stores that you have in that market is going to be dramatic. So if it's a profitable store, if it's a growing store, retailers will not close it. They will leverage real estate as best they can to try to reduce their operating expenses so they can expand their margin, but at the end of the day, the real estate doesn't make the decision on whether that store should be open or not. It's the market share and the profitability, and if the market share is there and the profitability is there, we're very confident that retailers won't use that as leverage to close the stores. Now we face that discussion everyday and we look at the threats of closing stores every day, and very, very rarely, very rarely has a tenant who said, ""If I can't reduce the size of my store unless I'm not going to renew my option,"" very rarely do they not then ultimately pick up the option at the last minute and continue to operate a profitable store.
David Oakes: Sri, to address one of the specific items in your question, I don't think our comment is that this is something we don't expect to have an impact on rents over time. We do in fact expect it to impact rents over time and we expect that impact to be positive. When the discussions occur with these retailers, they have a certain volume that they expect for a store, and whether they can get their exact footprint or not, they're multiplying that volume times their occupancy costs and that's the amount of rent they can pay and you really are ending up with a situation where we would expect sales per square foot and rents per square foot to be higher if they're operating in a more efficient size for them.
Srikanth Nagarajan: That's very helpful color, thanks. And my second question is on leasing spreads for the rest of the year. I mean, obviously, do you guys feel that 1Q was a little bit higher? And from a leasing mix perspective, is it going to be a little bit lesser over the rest of the year?
Daniel Hurwitz: Sri, I think what you're going to see is that there'll be some movement in the new deal spread. We're very comfortable that it will remain positive. The more important spread as we look at it is the renewal spread and I would feel very good about it. We went through several quarters of negative or flat spreads on our renewals, we've now had a few quarters in a row of 3% to 4% renewal spreads positive, and that's where we see that being pretty much at floor. We'll be in that 3%, 3% up, 3% and up range on the renewals. You'll see movement in the new deals spread, but we're confident in what we're seeing and what we've seen over the last couple of quarters that it'll remain positive. You're not going to always see it at a 9% rate in any quarter and I don't want to indicate that we expect that quarter-to-quarter, but I would expect positive results on the new deal spreads also.
Srikanth Nagarajan: That's helpful, I'll join back the line. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: Dan, you gave some statistics on obviously the non-prime portfolio sales, the $800 million and 79% leased. As you look at the sort of bottom 14% of the remaining portion that is yet to be completed, how much of an impact do you expect that to have on sort of your average household income, population densities, and even just overall occupancy?
Daniel Hurwitz: A lot of it because we're a national company and we're spread pretty far and our non-prime portfolio basically goes coast-to-coast. Some of the impact on those numbers is pretty diverse. But I think what we anticipate is that on the income side, non-prime generally is about a good 10% less than where we are on prime. And in many cases on the population,   it's 20% to 25% less. And that's pretty consistent. Now that's across a large portfolio so a lot will depend, on a quarter-to-quarter basis on the timing of those sales, but I think you could pretty well assume that the income side is going to be in the low double digits and the population should be somewhere in that 20% range plus.
David Oakes: And Jay, where that impact can be even larger in the way some people look at the stats, not exactly the way we look at the stats but the way some of the reports get published. When you weight it by the number of assets, if we eliminate the non-prime assets, you get an elimination of that 10% to 20% lower demographic on close to 50% of your assets. If you weight it the way we normally think about it and what we think is economically appropriate, it may only amount to 14% of the portfolio today and so you get 14%, times that 10% to 20% improvement. But for the way they announce this, is oftentimes done and published where your equal weighting it by asset, the impact on our overall portfolio demographics relative to what's published in many of those reports could get considerably better because the simple number of assets is high even though the NOI contribution is quite small.
Jonathan Habermann: Okay, so that's helpful. And then just thinking about, you mentioned addressing some 2012 debt earlier than expected. I mean, clearly the term loan jumps out, that $550 million. Can you give us some sense as you think about the deleveraging and obviously the pace of asset sales, and then also just tying in the acquisition opportunities you mentioned as well?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes. At this point, there's a clear focus on addressing some of the 2012 debt maturities. Quite early, the bank market is very strong at this point, and I think we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to refinance that for well in excess of the proceeds that are outstanding and maturing today. Our goal obviously, as we've articulated previously, is to continue to improve our leverage stats, to continue to have less exposure to short-term debt, to continue to have less exposure to bank debt. And so I think as we proceed with that refinancing, you should expect to see nothing larger than the size today and probably something overall that somewhat lowers our exposure to short-term bank debt, but exclusively at our option rather than at the option of the banks. In terms of deleveraging, I think when we think about the progress going forward, primarily thinking about it on a debt to EBITDA basis, we would expect dramatically more of the improvement going forward to come from the EBITDA growth side, rather than the debt reduction side. So not looking at raising equity to pay down debt and not looking at redeploying asset sale proceeds into debt paydown, more of those proceeds are being used exclusively for the acquisition efforts that we talked about earlier. So it really will be more debt-for-debt when we think about the refinancing activity for 2012, although we'd still firmly expect credit metrics to improve based on rising EBITDA and the monetization of some of the non-income producing assets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Dan, as you talk to your tenants, in the reports it sounds like Wal-Mart is taking a hit on their customer base from higher gas prices. Are you hearing any impact from higher gas prices from any other of your tenants? And if not, how do you think that the consumer, the average consumer, is absorbing $4-plus gas and still shopping?
Daniel Hurwitz: I think that's a great question. The short answer is, where we are hearing some concern from tenants, it's not necessarily on sales but on margin, because the cost of distribution has gone up dramatically, and as you know, as Paul mentioned, there has been some commodity price increases that many retailers have not been able to pass through to the consumer. And as you have transportation cost increases as well, particularly on moderately priced to discount-priced goods within margins to begin with in some cases, the cost of distribution becomes a much more significant impact on profitability and margin. In particular, for example, if you look at the dollar stores and stores that had a cap in some regard either by name or by philosophy on pricing, when you go from $2.50 a gallon to $4 a gallon for delivery but yet you can't really raise your pricing very much, it obviously is going to have an impact. So the deeper the discount, the larger the impact. And that's something that we hear about pretty consistently, not having a big impact on sales but could potentially have an impact on margin.
Alexander Goldfarb: And as far as where do you think -- how do you think the consumer -- what are your customers, your tenants telling you where the consumers are taking up that slack? Like how are they absorbing the -- how are they still shopping and still filling up the tank?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, I think one of the things -- in fact we had a couple of tenant meetings this week and one of the things that came out was people are very surprised at how accepting the consumer really has been to a $4 price. I think some people don't view that as sustainable. We've been there before, and it came back down, and I think time will tell whether it's going to stay where it is. But right now, the consumer has been less concerned than most of our retailers thought they would be, by inflated gas prices, and we'll see what happens through the summer. I think it'll be -- I think this summer where sales naturally soften will be a good indicator of a future trend.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then my second question is, Paul, on the occupancy, I think you mentioned the year end target of 93% occupied, the December 31 occupied rate was 90.6%. Can you give some color on first quarter occupancy and how we should think about the quarterly step-up to reaching that 93% target?
Paul Freddo: Sure. Again, for the last few first quarters Alex, we've recorded a small increase, which is a big deal because as I mentioned in the script, historically, we see about a 20-basis point hit in the first quarter with the move-outs and expirations versus new commencements. So the 10-basis point improvement feels good. The 92.6% includes the Brasil, but just looking at the metrics for a second going from 92.3% to 92.4%, I think we'll see similar trends to where we've seen in the past 2 years where we've got, it just -- it ramps up over the final 3 quarters of the year, and again I'm very comfortable with that 93%.
Alexander Goldfarb: Wait, were you talking about leased rate? I was asking about occupied -- occupancy rate?
Paul Freddo: I'm sorry. Yes, that's leased rate, yes. I'm sorry, I missed the point. Yes, leased rate, and again we actually -- we'll see that spread, if you will, between occupied and leased decrease over the course of the year. Not many openings in the first quarter, certainly more closings than lease expirations. So at this point, we've got a spread of about 220 basis points between leased rate and those tenants that are signed but not yet open and rent paying. Second quarter won't be a big quarter to reduce that spread either, but then third and fourth you'll see that come down, and obviously the number's going to have a direct relationship to how much new leasing we do. We don't expect it to come down to historic rates in that 50 to 100 basis point range any time soon, but you'll see the number shrink over the next few quarters, more people come online.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.
Christy McElroy: You talked about potential acquisitions. How active are you in sourcing new opportunities? Do you have a dollar value in mind as far as what you could potentially target over the next few years? And would you potentially use the ATM to fund the equity portion of future deals or would that be strictly coming from non-core asset sale proceeds?
Daniel Hurwitz: I'd say we are extremely active in reviewing acquisition opportunities today. That doesn't mean we're extremely active in closing acquisition opportunities today, but we are looking at everything that's out there, spending a lot of time on that, spending a lot of time talking to tenants about what locations do well for them and where we think we might be able to grow rents over time. And so it is a big focus for us, although I would not expect that to translate into a massive volume of acquisition activity. The reality is it's a very competitive deal, cap rates have been pushed significantly lower over the past year, and we're not willing to simply run around winning auctions to grow our square footage or our asset base if the economics don't make sense. So I think you'll continue to see us very disciplined in terms of what we do close on where we think there is an attractive opportunity. So right now, we'd reiterate what we have in our guidance where, from a capital recycling program, we expect to take disposition proceeds and redeploy those into acquisitions. Originally we had talked about something in the $100 million range. I think we would expect that we would feel very comfortable achieving that and might exceed that, but would also reiterate that we expect disposition proceeds to fund the acquisitions and would not expect to issue new equity to fund acquisitions at this time. If we found something particularly attractive, I think we'd have to explore that and we'd have to get feedback from investors and analysts about the market's response to that. But where we stand today we simply don't see opportunities that would encourage us to issue equity simply to grow our size. The focus has been on the capital recycling side, selling non-prime assets and reinvesting those proceeds into prime acquisitions, which is obviously a change in tune relative to the past several years where disposition proceeds were funding debt repayment.
David Oakes: Clearly, one of the things that's happening also, Christy, and I think it's going to be very, very interesting next month for those of you who are going to RECon in Las Vegas to keep an eye out for this, is that cap rate compression is an incredible motivator for those people who own assets to sell assets. And we are seeing more product now that we've seen in many years quite frankly, and stuff that's coming on on the market that we had not expected to even come on the market. And I think that there's an opportunity that, in Las Vegas this year, there's going to be a lot of folks shopping their product because they are enticed by what we're all seeing as sort of peak cap rate compression and tight pricing. And there's a lot of interest and a lot of capital that's resulting in that pricing power. So I think we're going to see a very, very different May convention this year, where there's going to be a number of people looking to shop their product and much more so than we've had in the last several years.
Christy McElroy: Okay, and then just following up on leasing spreads, could you give us some sense for what the difference in spreads has been in the last quarter or two between space under 10,000 square feet and over 10,000 square feet?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, Christy. It's been pretty consistent across the range of sizes, but we're seeing more improvement in the smaller space, if you will. It's -- they can achieve higher rents, more flexibility in who you can put in there, what they can pay. The box space, we continue to see gradual improvement in first-year rent but we're seeing a greater improvement in what we're seeing in the small shelf space, and that's really as it's being leased to more national tenants such as the phone companies and the small restaurants and such.
Christy McElroy: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: What new tenants are you seeing come in to your center or new concepts?
Daniel Hurwitz: Not so much in the new concepts in our product type. We're seeing more flexibility in terms of different store sizes and people that are hitting new markets, Carol. We're seeing some of the -- we talked a little bit about the flexibility and not confusing that with the need to downsize. So we're seeing some tenants reach into smaller, more diverse markets, more rural in some cases, than they would typically have entered, and that's really what we're seeing new in our product type. We are seeing a few of the folks who were married to mall space such as Kirkland's now very interested in strip center space, but not a lot of new concepts. It's really more maneuvering of existing retailers and what they're doing differently in terms of size and product offering.
Daniel Hurwitz: And that is something that concerns us. One of the things that we are concerned about is the lack of new product from a consumer perspective because we -- what would make shopping exciting is when you have new concepts, new stores, new price points and new vendors coming into the market in a new environment and we don't have a lot of that. If you walk into one of our centers that's Target/Kohl's anchored in California or one of our centers that's Target/Kohl's anchored in Connecticut, they're very similar, they're very similar in merchandise mix. And we would like to see more new concepts because we think the consumer is easily bored by some of the offerings that they see in retail in the United States in general. The one thing that we have to be very careful about though is that some of the new concepts that have been presented to us, we just don't feel are economically feasible. There are some new concepts out there that many people talk about and some are actually getting very excited about where we just can't seem to understand that the combination of the size, the occupancy cost, the merchandise mix, the margin and the profitability. And when those cases present themselves to us, while we would love to add someone new to our center, we're just not willing to take the risk on that merchant. We've been to that show before and we're not going to go back.
Carol Kemple: Are you seeing any of your existing tenants like Bed Bath & Beyond had a couple of concepts -- come out with new concepts at this point?
Paul Freddo: No, but what we're going to see and we are seeing, Carol, is that they're going to grow the new concept. Bed Bath is a great example. buybuy BABY is a relatively small piece of that business today, but tremendous growth opportunity. Now they're really running with their three concepts, the Bed Bath & Beyond, the buybuy BABY and the Christmas Tree Shops. And they actually have one other concept, Harmon's, which is not a big part of their business. But what we will see is that's a lot for one company anyway, and the fact that they've got a lot of runway left with concepts such as buybuy BABY.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley from Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: Just in terms of EPNs off of the remaining shares of EDT, if EPN is successful in taking the vehicle private, are you likely to maintain management of the portfolio and the $3 million to $4 million of management fees that you get?
Paul Freddo: Given where we stand with the bitter statement being released and the Target statement soon to be released, there's not much we can say about this situation. But going back to the original IPO documents, our property management and leasing rights are evergreen in nature as long as the trust and the U.S. manager are in existence.
Quentin Velleley: Okay. And I'm not sure of what EPN's intentions are, and I think they're sort of bidding on an implied cap rate above 9%. If I were to break up the portfolio and sell parts of it, is there a selection of prime assets in there that you would be interested in?
Paul Freddo: There are absolutely a large number of prime assets in there. But I'm sorry, Quentin, we really can't speculate on what's going to happen here, particularly where we sit with the timeline of disclosures.
Quentin Velleley: Got it. Maybe one for Dan then. You commented on looking at prime acquisitions on a loan-to-own basis through mezz or through bank senior loans. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of the size of the opportunity and how you're going about accessing some of those potential opportunities?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, one of the ways that obviously we're accessing those opportunities, is through our lenders. In many cases, we're meeting with our banks who are informing us of situations where they think there could be a potential issue or there is an issue. And we are looking at some of those assets on a perspective of would we like to own that asset. If we don't want to -- if we would not be interested in owning the asset, we're not going to loan mezz and we're not going to buy the senior note even at a substantial discount. These have to be assets that we think fit the prime designation and fit it without question. So that's one of the ways we're doing it. The other way is, as you know, is we have done a few of these deals and sometimes when you do a few of these deals, people come to you. And we have had some of the people that we know in the market, particularly, obviously, on the private side, who have some maturities that are coming up or have come up and passed. And they got a one-year extension, and that one-year extension is now coming up and they have other issues. There's a refinancing pressure, the loan-to-values and the spreads and the amount of equity that's required to refinance goes beyond their capabilities, and we're a logical place for them to come if they own the product that we like. So as David mentioned, we're being very -- we're being highly selective because this is not just a yield play. This is an enhance-your-portfolio and asset management play. So we're underwriting these assets, even in the case where we may not own it. We're underwriting the assets as if we were going to own it and being very careful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samit Parikh from ISI Group.
Samit Parikh: Just wanted to follow up on a little bit of what you just said, Dan, and you were talking about a lot of assets coming to the market. And we know that a lot of pension funds are sort of sitting on the sidelines with cash targeting waiting for core retail to come out and are going to underwrite very aggressively. One question I wanted to -- well, two questions really. One was are your return requirements coming in considerably from where they have been historically because you want to be more competitive on these potential acquisitions? And two, if people are starting and you're saying that we're sort of at peak pricing and underwriting is getting aggressive, have you thought about maybe selling some core end markets that you might not have a dominant presence in or a big presence in and sort of recycling that capital into value-add opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, certainly, with the pricing where it is today, Samit, and I think you're right on point, there is -- it is enticing to think about selling some core products, some prime product. But that is not our goal, and that is not where we're going to be. If it happens in our company and you may see it happens because a joint venture has decided to sell a prime asset, and it's trading at a price we feel is not appropriate and therefore, we let it go to the market. I think one of the important things that -- to keep in mind, when bidding against pension funds, private equities, et cetera, is our access to information often gives us a competitive disadvantage. We're not going to try to outbid private capital just for the sake of winning the bid. As David mentioned earlier, we don't want to think that we're -- we made a great deal and we're smart just because we paid more than the next guy. It's not hard to win when you pay more than the next guy. The important thing to keep in mind though, is that our access to the tenant community gives us great information on what we feel is going to happen to that asset. So for example, we looked an asset recently that we did not -- we were not successful on and we knew there's going to be significant rent roll downs. And I can assure you that the buyer of that asset has no access to that information, is not anticipating rent roll downs and probably underwrote the option extensions at exactly as they were written in the lease. That's an inappropriate way to look at that asset. We know that, and that will make us noncompetitive. And I think a lot of -- it's not just us. I think a lot of the other publicly traded REITs that have good tenant relations, they're going to have the same issue when bidding against private capital. One of the things that we'd like to do is, obviously, find opportunities to leverage the platform. So while risk on pricing is not something we always are willing to take, we are willing to take a little risk, for example, on leasing because that access to tenant information, while sometimes can be a negative in the bidding process, very often can be a positive in the bidding process as well. And where it's a positive it's where tenants have expressed an interest in doing business with landlords that they know can deliver them product on time, on budget and in the right season. So that's really where we're focused, but I would not expect us and you should not expect to see us bidding successfully against passive-aggressive private capital, because our operating platform really wouldn't permit us to underwrite the assets in the same manner.
Paul Freddo: Regarding the part of the question on return requirement, I think there's two sides to that answer relative to our return requirement. Two years ago -- we are much more aggressive today in looking at lower return requirements relative to two years ago simply as a function that our cost of capital has changed dramatically. When we had to think about potential acquisition activity a couple of years ago and you're underwriting cost of debt somewhere in the 10% to 25% range and a cost of equity in the 25% to 50% range, it's obviously something that's going to make new acquisition activity have to have an extremely high return threshold. So we're in considerably relative to where we have been a couple of years ago due to cost capital improvement. Relative to the longer term history of DDR as a major portfolio acquirer, I'd say our return thresholds are not only higher than they were, looking back 4  to 10 years, but also the definition of returns is different than what it had been in the past. No longer that notion of what's the initial yield on the initial accretion, the focus is much more on the long-term return opportunity. But even with that, I would say our return requirements are higher than they were, say, 5 years ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wigginton from DISCERN.
David Wigginton: So Dan, you guys had talked a lot about acquisitions, and I think Samit just touched on the dispositions. Can you maybe just give us an idea of what the market is like from maybe a demand and pricing perspective for the assets in your non-prime bucket? I know you guys have been pretty active on that. Just wondering if you expect to see maybe an uptick in the volume that you've experienced thus far, maybe this year over the past couple of quarters.
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, we would like to. We would like to be able to come back to you at some point in time and say that this market gave us the opportunity to accelerate asset dispositions beyond what we had originally guided to. And there is certainly more interest in B/C assets than we have seen in the past. It's not unusual for us now to get multiple bids on assets when in the past we really got one or two bids, if we were lucky, on an asset. But I'm not yet convinced and I do think, by the way, based -- looking at the appointment schedule, Vegas will be very important, about dispositions as well as acquisitions as I mentioned earlier. I'm not convinced that the market is exuberant about B minus C assets as some people think. Clearly, there has been some transactions out there. We've done some, but there's been others that are much larger than what we're doing. And one of the things that happens when those transactions occur is that there are winners and there are losers. And the losers have, in their minds, decided that perhaps chasing yield in B/C markets is a good thing. And hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to take advantage of that but -- and we will pursue that as aggressively as we can. But we'll see. We'll see. I think sometimes the market gets ahead of the real interest level, and when people come in to talk to you, I think it's not a question of just chasing yield. I think it's a question of trying to steal assets, and we're not in the position at this point in time where we're going to sell assets for cap rates that we feel are totally inappropriate given the current position of the asset in the market.
Paul Freddo: Beside Dan's comments on price sensitivity, the other major issue and mitigating factor for us is going to be that we simply have dramatically less of this product than we had a few years ago. So when you talk about acceleration or deceleration of disposition activity, almost by definition, it has to be a deceleration simply because we sold over $2 billion of that product over the past couple of years, and we just don't have nearly as much inventory remaining. And so exactly as Dan mentioned, it remains a big focus. We continue to push on that side to improve the portfolio quality, but there's a heck of a lot less inventory here at DDR today of non-prime product.
David Wigginton: So in light of that then, I guess, what -- from looking at your long-term occupancy goal, what -- I mean, how much of your non-prime portfolio do you need to dispose of to achieve that? I know you guys have been active on the lease upfront, but presumably, you're getting rid of 75%, 80% occupied assets. That's helping your overall portfolio occupancy rate. What -- I mean, maybe a better way of asking this is maybe over the last year, what percentage of your occupancy increase of 110 basis points was attributable to disposing of non-prime properties versus lease-out?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's a good question, David. But the answer is almost none, and the reason is because many of the non-prime assets actually had a higher occupancy rate than the prime portfolio. It's just that we felt that, that occupancy rate was either unsustainable in the nearer term or the long term. So we sold assets, for example, when we were 90% leased, that were 94% leased. That was not uncommon for us to do that. We just didn't like the markets.  We didn't perhaps like the credit quality of that 94%, et cetera. As far as going forward is concerned, our goals for occupancy do not assume that the portfolio is different than it is today. So when we say that we feel we can get to a 95% or 95.5% leased portfolio, we feel we can do that through leasing space in both prime and non-prime assets. What will impact that number is if we sell prime assets that are at a lower level than that, the occupancy rate will go up sooner than we anticipated, and maybe we'll hit 95% before three years or two years or maybe we'll hit it within the next couple. So that's something that will be impacted by asset sales in the short run. But in the long run, we feel that the 95.5% is achievable through the existing portfolio of prime and non-prime, or having less non-prime and having more prime where perhaps there's some value-add opportunity. So there is some vacancy that comes with some of that.
David Wigginton: Okay. And I guess just regarding your 95.5% occupancy rate, what -- you broke out your leased rates by, I guess, by shop size. And where would your small shop occupancy level need to get to, to get to that 95.5%? And I guess, what do you consider sort of the stabilized occupancy rate for those, like -- the stores?
Paul Freddo: In the mid to high 80s, Dave. I mean, historically, that hasn't been a whole heck of a lot higher than that. But that's what I'm looking at, getting that small shop space somewhere in the mid to high 80s. And keep in mind, we're also working to reduce our exposure to that shop space, that size, right. We know it's the most difficult, most challenging in re-leasing. So whether it's conversion to larger space, consolidation of small tenants -- or small tenant space, or the majority of that -- or a large percentage anyway, of that small shop space is going to be within their non-prime portfolio.
David Wigginton: Okay. And then just a quick question on the supplemental. You're leased information, it looks like it includes your Brazil portfolio now. I just wanted to confirm that the quarterly leasing summary also includes Brazil?
Paul Freddo: That's correct. We've tried to continue to make improvements with the supplemental, make it simpler and I think especially now with the IPO at Sonae Sierra Brasil, the reality is it's not just the issue of do we include it in the stats or not. We've made the decision to have an ownership stake down there. It's been an important and very attractive investment for us, and we have included it in the statistics this quarter. It had a very minimal impact on the leased rate, but on a go-forward basis, we just thought the right strategy was to have it included in there as it's obviously part of the portfolio.
David Wigginton: Is that at your share, or is that on a 100% basis?
Paul Freddo: The majority of the portfolio statistics are at 100% share of everything. So whether it's a 15%-owned U.S. joint venture, whether it's the third -- 1/3 ownership stake we have in Sonae Sierra Brasil or a consolidated asset at 100%, they're all in there at full ownership.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore: I'm curious, with your comments about the demand for a product especially coming up at ICSC. Does it make sense with all the yield buyers out there to put together a portfolio rather than a bunch of one-off type asset sales and take advantage of that a bit?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, it does. Yes, it does for a lot of reasons. Number one, for us to get to the volume we've been getting to on a one-off basis is a sort of a Herculean effort when you're doing 50 deals, 60 deals a year. The centers are going to be somewhere, obviously, under about 100,000 square feet and you're dealing with a lot of local buyers. If it's possible to put together a package that makes sense that we can accelerate our portfolio transition, we would do so.
Richard Moore: And I'm guessing, Dan, that would be in excess of the $100 million type targets targeted for the year?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, that's correct, Rich.
Richard Moore: Okay. And then with the flexibility that the retailers are showing at this point that you guys talked about, I'm curious if you would be likely to accelerate redevelopment of some centers to accommodate the new demands for retailers or maybe even some new development from that standpoint? Curious, I guess, as far as redevelopments and developments going forward, what you're thinking.
Paul Freddo: Yes, is the simple answer, Rich. I mean, this is something we are talking about, looking at every day. We've got a meeting this afternoon to review another portfolio by region just to make sure we're not missing any opportunities, because there will be more and more opportunities in this area. As we mentioned at Investor Day, right now we're focused on a 5-year program that's around $350 million, with about a $45 million spend this year. We're on pace to do that, and if the  returns are right and the demand is there, we will accelerate. It's something we look at everyday. There are certain smaller things that don't even hit that radar screen in terms of redevelopment, where -- a situation with a PetSmart recently with three small shops that have sat vacant for as long as we've owned this asset and then we're putting in a 12,000-foot PetSmart. We're not even showing that in that redevelopment category, if you will. But it's a great example of a flexible PetSmart willing to go 12,000 in this market, and we've got space that, again, sat vacant for a number of years and we can fit them in. So yes, we're very excited about the redevelopment. We continue to look for more opportunities every day, and we will continue to keep you guys all apprised of that.
Richard Moore: Okay. And then Paul, would development fall into that too? Any of the idle developments you guys still have on the books, or is it still too early to think for a -- from the development...
Paul Freddo: We talked about, Rich, there's interest out there. We're in no hurry, very consistent with what we've been saying for a while now. We're going to talk -- there's interest in a small group of the sites we now own and control, and we'll talk about it at RECon this year. We're not setting any time frames. We're not talking about any, this is our opening date. We're going to talk to the retailers. We're going to see what they're willing to do with rent. We know, as we've mentioned time and time again, that there's a little bit of a panic mode out there about '12 and then '13 for sure in terms of the open to buys the retailers have. So I don't want to comment too much about what we'll see at RECon, but we're going to talk about it and we'll be able to report back on that. But we're going to be taking the temperature, if you will, and again, we're in no hurry. What's happening with the supply and demand story has been working very well for us, but we'll see what they have to say at RECon.
Daniel Hurwitz: Rich, to Paul's point, every month that goes by, retailers are getting closer and closer to a problem, which is satisfying those 2013 and 2014 open to buys, and I think they are recognizing that with increasing frequency. So I do think that will be a topic of conversation at RECon. I think it'll be front and center with a lot of tenants who have large open to buys requirements for 2012 and '13, and the fact that space is being absorbed relatively quickly in the existing portfolio. And they're going to have to either rethink their pricing requirements for new developments, or they're going to have to figure out how to grow their business without new stores. And I don't know too many retailers that want to think about growing their business without new stores. So I think the conversations over the next 3, 4 months are going to be very, very interesting in regard to development.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Clark with Green Street Advisors.
Laura Clark: As values are increasing and have increased and development prospects are increasing as well, what's happening to land values today? And is there a market for the land in your portfolio?
Paul Freddo: There's more conversation, Laura. Yes, we've had some activity in the first quarter. We're in discussions and negotiations on certain other pieces. So there's clearly a heightened level of conversation and discussion as it pertains to vacant land today. And obviously, we're going to continue to pursue where we can with that. And so I could just tell you, the activity level has certainly much increased from the last couple of years. So there is a market. We've got to determine what that market is.
Laura Clark: Okay. And then lastly, I noticed that you took out your bankrupt tenant leasing disclosure this quarter. Can you give us an update on the progress you've made towards leasing the space in 1Q and what the prospects are for the remaining boxes?
Paul Freddo: Yes, we were -- and I'll explain a little bit of why we did that, Laura. We were up about 80% total activity, and I believe we recorded 82% at the end of the fourth quarter. There's not a lot left, there's somewhere in that 600,000, 700,000 square feet, because that was a select group. Those were the four Linens, Circuit, Goody's and Steve & Barry’s that we were talking about, and we didn't want to continue just to focus on that. I think it leads into a good question about Borders and Blockbuster though, which are front and center for all of us. And there's a great level of activity on both of those portfolios. They were widely anticipated bankruptcies and both very confusing situations for those retailers, by the way. We're talking for a minute about -- Blockbuster, as we've said several times before, being entirely out of that portfolio is our goal. We believe we will be there probably within the next year and that's even if they don't liquidate. It's great space. We're seeing a lot of activity from the banks, from Five Guys, from Panera, Corner Bakery and the like. We're not having any difficulty. It comes with some pain. There's some downtime and some investment on some of this, and the same is true with Borders. Borders, there is clearly no certainty what's going to happen in this bankruptcy process. We know what they'd like to do. They're not getting a lot of love from the publishers, and without product, you're in a very bad situation, obviously, as any type of retailer. But we've recently -- we're not in position to name the tenants because leases aren't signed. But we've just gotten 5 back and of those 5, 2 of them we have done deals with best-in-class retailers and good chance we get them open this year. It's exciting stuff, and it comes with some pain. There's some downtime on rents, but these are going to be better assets, better centers with these replacement tenants. Activity level is high on both of those retailers. So we'll probably spend a little more time keeping you all updated on those categories. There's just really not a lot to say about the four older bankruptcies, if you will.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: First question, going back to the mezz loans for a second. Can you talk a little bit about what the pricing looks like on some of the transactions you're looking at? And is it safe to assume that if the base case is for $100 million of capital deployment via recycling, that these debt investments would be probably in the minority in terms of a portion of that?
Paul Freddo: I would absolutely agree with your latter point. The point, I think, is that we're looking at a large range of opportunities. Pricing is aggressive for the most core, the most trophy sort of opportunities, and so that's obviously where there's a lot of product on the market but not necessarily where we see a huge opportunity for DDR. And so we are looking at some situations where we could enter at a different spot in the capital stack, but would expect that to be a very small minority of the overall activity. And rates on that would be relatively widespread, but something in the very low double digits would be a reasonable assumption. But again, it really varies quite widely across the spectrum of opportunities we're looking at.
Michael Mueller: Okay. And then going back to the downsized stores one more time. Based on the experiences that you've seen so far and situations where somebody is downsized, is it safe to assume that the rents really haven't changed on day one when you're talking about rents going higher on a per square foot basis? You were talking about that kind of over time. And then second part of that is, for the space that's come back and then you have big centers, big boxes, not as much small shop space, does some of the space just kind of get permanently taken out of service? Or is it cut up so pretty much everything you get back you make sure it's leasable?
Paul Freddo: On the first question, Mike, a little different story  a couple of years ago when there was, clearly, the position where we couldn't afford to lose any more space, we and everybody else on the landlord side. But I would tell you, the deals we're making right now on the downsizing, we are expecting an upside in the rent immediately on the smaller store, if you will, and clearly on the residual space. But a big part of our exercise is making sure, working with the retailer that we are left with leasable space. I can't think of an example with a downsizing of an existing tenant where we haven't been left with leasable space. Carving up vacant boxes, and there we have had a couple of situations. But very small amounts of space, maybe several hundred square feet or 1,000 square feet where it's just you can't bring in the two new tenants or the one new tenant you're talking about and lease all the space. But that is more of a 2-year ago, a year ago story. It's become different. And we've had a couple examples where a major retailer who wanted to get smaller than the 30,000 foot box to be ideal, and we were left with unleasable space, we didn't make the deal. They've come back, we've made the deal, they're taking the whole box and actually at a higher rent than they were talking about a year and a half ago. So that's what we're seeing. But we are expecting upside if you take your store from 30,000 feet to 18,000 feet, you will pay a higher rent and we're not getting a lot of resistance on that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Macquarie.
Ki Kim: Just a couple of questions on your leasing spreads. If you look at, say, on a broad level, the national rent cycle for retail, it would imply that the lease spread should be negative 10%, not positive. So I'm just wondering, what is the reason for the positive spreads? Is it that you're rolling over just much older leases, or is it a function of more current demand? And if nothing changes in this world and market rates stay flat, what does this look like a couple years out?
Daniel Hurwitz: First of all, it's important to remember what our calculation. We are not including space that's been vacant for more than one year, and there are several reasons for that. Some of this stuff has been vacant since we've owned the asset. Some space that's never been leased. We have always used the calculation of space that's been vacant for one year or less in the spread. And an historic practice is that's because space is turning at that rate. So that the spread we're quoting is for just space that was vacant for less than one year. And we expect rents to continue to improve as the supply and demand story is working in on our favor. And again, that is clearly why our focus is going to continue to be on average first year rents of new deals as we put in the supplemental, and then also with the net effective rent, which is very important too. We actually had a lower CapEx per square foot on our new deals, and that's something we're going to continue to emphasize.
Paul Freddo: Another item I'd bring up is you do a lot of great macro research. We love the product, look at it even before you had covered us. But I do think one of the shortfalls that we see and that you're going to continue to find is that the macro analysis for this property type just doesn't work as well as for some of the other property types where you've used it. And it's just that difference between commodity-oriented space and non-commodity oriented space where you really will and have one shopping center vacant and another one fully occupied across the street from one another and you simply don't see that dynamic on other property types -- or you see it have a massive impact on rents and that's just not how it works here. Another issue is going to be the quality of the data that you can get on other property types versus what you can get here. The nature of brokers being less involved in retail leasing versus other property types means that, that national data that oftentimes comes from brokers is the absolute best source of information for office or industrial, just doesn't have the same quality when you think about the data that you're getting on a national basis for retail and can oftentimes be skewed by a huge amount of freestanding retailers, single-tenant boxes that represent a huge portion of the denominator that is oftentimes reflected in those stats. So we understand the numbers you're looking at. But we would downplay those for this property type. It's just the macro story oftentimes really misses what's going on when you truly dig in to a certain market or submarkets for our property type.
Ki Kim: Okay. And how about for the second part of that question. If market rates stay the same, where do you think leasing spreads go for a couple years out from here?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, if market rates stay the same, leasing spreads should also be about the same. But I don't think we've had a time in our history where market rates stayed the same, and we've obviously had times where they've gone down and we've had more times where they've gone up. A lot of that's going to really depend on your view of inflation and where you think the inflationary environment is going to go. If you think that we are headed towards a period of significant inflation, you can assume that comp store sales will go up dramatically. And market rents will go up dramatically as a result because at the end of the day, what the tenant pays is just a percent of overall sales and what they can afford to pay is a percent of overall sales. If you think we're going to still be in a deflationary environment, then I think there's going to be very little growth and you could start to see some pressure in a deflationary pricing environment where commodity prices are perhaps going up and retailers aren't able to actually transfer that cost increase over to the consumer. The consumer has been somewhat unwilling to absorb price increases, and the retailer has no choice but to accept price increases. So I think a lot of -- the answer to the question and I think it's a great question, is really going to depend on your view on what you think the next couple of years will hold for us from an inflationary perspective.
Ki Kim: Okay. Thank you for that, it was helpful. And just to comment on the commodity prices, ignoring gas prices for a second. I did look at the prices for cotton. It's basically doubled in the past year. So what implications does that have for clothing or Bed Bath & Beyond, those type of retailer margins and what that can mean for how much you can push rents on them going forward?
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, I think it's an issue that we have to monitor very carefully. As of right now today, if you talk to most retailers, they'll tell you there has not been an impact because keep in mind that most of the goods that they get, they've gotten -- the orders were placed a long time ago. And you place your orders nine to 12 months in advance of a season, so you're looking at a lag. But going forward, I think it's something that we have to watch very carefully because if the retailer is unable to pass along that increase, it will have an impact on margin. And as we all know, retailers pay their rent with margin, not with comp store sales. That's why we focus so much on the margin line and the profitability line and not the comp store sales line. Comp store sales are nice, but they don't pay the bills, per se. And I think it's something that could have a real impact if the retailer is unable to pass along the pricing increase to the consumer. Now that being said, we can go into our centers today, and we can find plenty of evidence where retailers are trying to pass along the increase, some of the increases, that they either anticipate or they're currently experiencing. And I think the consumer ultimately will determine how successful that is.
Ki Kim: Okay. And last quick question. As I look at your 2012 debt maturities, the $1.1 billion coming through, what is the average effective interest rate and what do you think the average effective interest rate will be when you refinance that?
David Oakes: I think we've got that specific number in the supplemental. The largest components of it are going to be the term loan, which is $550 million in LIBOR plus 88 basis points. $100 million of that $550 million has LIBOR swap to a high 4% rate. But still all-in, you're at 1.5% for half of that debt. The second largest component of it is what remains of our large convert that has a base interest rate of 3%, but for accounting purposes, we actually book it in the mid-5% range. So from what's showing up on the income statement, it's a little higher than that. So all-in, you would blend in terms of what's being expensed, to somewhere in the 3s. And with the same thing on refinancing. Right now, you'd see the spread on the term loan go up somewhat. That increase will be dramatically less than what we or anyone else would've speculated in the past. And I think the bond market gives us good pricing for -- the secondary market gives us good feedback on what  pricing would be for a 5-, 7- or 10-year bond issuance in the -- somewhere between the low 4s and low 5% rates depending on what exact tenor we pick. So all-in, if today you're expensing somewhere in the mid-3s, I think it's credible that you would go to somewhere in the mid-4s, all-in on that 2012 expiration activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya. [Jefferies]
Omotayo Okusanya: Going back to the question of retail bankruptcies. I know you guys don't have that much exposure to Blockbuster. Could you kind of talk about what you're hearing out of them at this point?
Paul Freddo: Yes, Tayo. It's -- everybody knows the Dish Network was the successful bidder at auction, and they're talking about still coming out with 500 stores. It's hard to visualize why the Dish Network needs 5,000 square-foot stores and 500 of them. So our approach is clearly going to be, like, we're going to get them all back. They've been telling us, in our example, where we're down to about 16 or 17 that there's probably 7 leases they would assume because they want to operate them. They obviously can't control that. But our view is that, that this is a short-term play, and at the end of the day, there's a liquidation of most, if not all, of the physical locations.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time, and this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."
13,SITC,2,2011,2011-07-30 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 Developers Diversified Realty Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chantilly, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Tim Lordan, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please proceed, Sir.
Timothy Lordan: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K, and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release, and our quarterly financial supplement, are available on our website at ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, Tim. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to begin the call by highlighting our continued focus on capital recycling and enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio. The successful refinancing of the term loan and the revolving credit facilities have provided greater financial flexibility in a more competitive cost of capital for our company. As a result, we are intently focused on sourcing external growth opportunities to the acquisition of prime assets and recycling capital from non-prime assets sales. As highlighted in our June 30 press release, we disposed of an additional $112 million of primarily non-prime assets during the second quarter and have $85 million of prime assets under contract to acquire. The non-prime assets sold were primarily in secondary and tertiary markets and some were single-tenant  assets while others were non- income-producing assets. To the contrary, the properties under contract were creatively sourced, are located in a target market with demographics that will enhance our prime portfolio and have growth characteristics that will be maximized through our operating platform and tenant relationships. In addition to the assets under contract, our pipeline of acquisition opportunities include core, core plus and value-add  assets and our underwriting will continue to be very disciplined. Acquisitions are all about growth, not asset count. In addition to the external growth opportunities that we are actively sourcing, we are keenly focused on maximizing our internal growth opportunities due to continued lease up of our portfolio, and the aggressive pursuit of redevelopments. As highlighted by our quarterly same-store NOI growth of 3.6%, we are continuing to see the benefits of the leasing momentum that has existed within our portfolio for the past several quarters, and we believe the strong NOI growth will continue in the near term as we work our way back to a stabilized lease rate of at least 95%. More over, as mentioned on prior calls, we have been working hard to identify redevelopment opportunities within our existing portfolio. Based upon our thorough review of near-term and long-term opportunities, we have identified nearly $750 million of potential redevelopments that will be pursued over the next 5 years. The reduced  risk profile of redevelopments are attractive relative to ground-up development projects and provide compelling, typically double-digit, first year, unlevered cash on cost returns. Moreover, with our continued focus on improving the quality of our portfolio, we are excited about the opportunity to invest in many of our highest quality assets, further enhancing net asset value. When thinking of DDR going forward, our goal is to be viewed as a company with an increasingly high-quality portfolio that will continue to improve over time. As a company with an exciting internal growth story through continued lease-up and rent-roll  growth, and an external growth story driven by acquisitions that leverage the strengths of our operating platform. Also, a company with an opportunistic redevelopment program that will maximize the value of assets already owned. Finally, you should continue to expect additional improvement to our balance sheet, credit metrics, and credit ratings. At DDR, we are constantly thinking about retail, the positives and the negatives, learning from our retail partners, and using that knowledge to energize a platform dedicated to creating value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thank you, Dan. I'll begin by highlighting what was another highly productive quarter followed by a brief discussion regarding a subject that deserves a great deal of attention: portfolio quality and why it matters. Regarding our quarterly leasing results, our domestic leased rate increased to 92.8%. This represents a 120 basis point increase over the second quarter of 2010, and a 40 basis-point  increase sequentially. Including Brazil, our blended leased rate is now at 93%. We expect this momentum to continue in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in a blended leased rate of over 93.2% by year end. In the second quarter, we completed a total of 483 deals for over 2.5 million square feet, with a combined spread of 6%, up from 3.9% one year ago, and 5.4% in the first quarter. This represents our fifth straight quarter of positive combined leasing spreads and illustrates the consistent demand for quality space. It is important to note that this growth has been achieved with lower CapEx on a per square-foot  basis, and that the impact of these results will be apparent in our income statement in the coming year, while the full impact will show up in 2013. I would now like to take a few minutes to discuss the importance of portfolio quality and how we should evaluate the quality of a specific asset. There are many ways to evaluate the quality of a portfolio or a particular asset including local demographics, comparisons to national averages, occupancy levels, rental growth, et cetera. But one factor should stand above all else, the retailers. The retailer knows the consumer better than any landlord and the consumer certainly shows that they frequent the most successful and compelling retailers. More over, it's critical to keep in mind that no consumer shops at any property based on who owns it, they shop exclusively based on the tenants that occupy it. Speaking of the tenants the consumer votes for every day, our portfolio consists mostly of power centers with destination tenants such as Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, TJX, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Publix, PetSmart, and many other national credits that attract other high-quality retailers as co-tenants and generate significant sales volumes. These retailers have game-changing  marketing, real estate and merchandising strategies that drive customers to their stores and therefore increase the value of our centers. These retailers and the others that we are doing business with every day are also the retailers that have consistently grown market share. Most importantly they grew market share before and during the recession and continue to grow share even coming off positive comps. Just the 8 aforementioned retailers have plans to open over 75 million square feet of new stores in aggregate over the next 2 years. As a company that has leased more than 32 million square feet of space in the last 3 years, our portfolio is a first look for successful retailers with aggressive open to buys. While we can all acknowledge that there is vacant space out there, never in my career have I seen such an imbalance between the demand for space from retailers and the lack of quality supply. In our portfolio, over 73% of our GLA consists of units that are over 10,000 square feet and these same units are over 95% leased and represent 62% of base rent. Only 17% of our GLA consists of units less than 5,000 square feet and they represent 26% of base rent. So in summary, our portfolio was more heavily weighted towards anchor and junior-anchor  credit tenants than local small shops. With our shop space roughly 83% leased and approximately 3 million square feet of vacancy in space larger than 10,000 square feet, we continue to see significant internal growth potential in both categories. As a result of our tenants' operational successes and the high demand combined with the lack of quality new supply, as Dan mentioned, we are significantly ramping up our redevelopment efforts. For example, in addition to the 2 Target redevelopments in Denver and San Antonio, which we mentioned in our May 18 press release, we're currently undergoing a redevelopment at one of our largest assets, Plaza Del Norte in Puerto Rico. We are eliminating chronically vacant small shop space and previously unleaseable common area to accommodate an expansion of J. C. Penney. And we are also combining 4 vacant small shop units to provide PetSmart with another one of their early stores on the island. These 3 projects total $40 million in investment at a combined 10.5% unlevered cash on cost yield and are indicative of the opportunities that we are pursuing. Before closing, I would also like to again address the popular theme of tenants' desire to downsize and explain why this can be an opportunity for value creation. Using Best Buy as an example, there are 20 locations of over 40,000 square feet in our portfolio. As a result, we estimate we could get back as much as 250,000 square feet in residual space in the next 3- to 5-year  period should Best Buy execute exactly as their public statements outlined. It could easily take longer and it is highly unlikely it would take less time to meet those stated downsizing goals. It's also important to note that all but one of those stores are in prime assets, by re-leasing the residual square footage at current market rents, we estimate over $1 million of embedded based rental growth from this potential downsizing alone, keeping in mind there are opportunities with other retailers as well. There will, in many cases, be some short-term downtime and potentially some capital spend on build out depending on the individual deal,  but long-term, this is a great opportunity for DDR and Best Buy alike. But this is all at the landlord's discretion. Best Buy does not have the contractual right to downsize unless their lease is up for renewal, meaning everything is up for negotiation. And since all but one location are primed, should we be unable to come to terms and they leave all together, the growth potential is even greater. The bottom line is, we are supportive of Best Buy's plans, and we're working directly with them to create a positive result for both of us but still the deal  has to make economic sense for DDR. In summary, when considering the tremendous quality endorsement that our portfolio continues to receive from our customer, the tenant, as evidenced by consistent leasing momentum, and the dynamic that exists with certain tenants expressing an interest in downsizing while others desire growth, one can conclude that the supply and demand dynamic within our portfolio presents a compelling opportunity for occupancy and rental growth today and tomorrow. I will now turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $64.4 million or $0.23 per share for the second quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Including nonoperating items, FFO for the quarter was $24.1 million or $0.09 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily impairment charges and losses related to the disposition of certain non-prime assets as well as the write-off  of original issuance costs related to redemption of our 8% Series G preferred shares in April. Gains of approximately $14 million on asset sales were recognized in net income during the quarter, and are excluded from both FFO measures. As you may have noticed from the press release, we are tightening our guidance for 2011 operating FFO per share by $0.03 on the low end and the high end to $0.93 to $1.02 per share. The midpoint is unchanged despite the aggressive execution of our 2011 strategic objectives. We exceeded our full year disposition objectives during the first half of the year, significantly accelerated the timing of our capital raises and refinancing and have lowered our amount of floating-rate  debt. With all that, we are encouraged to still be able to maintain our full year guidance midpoint. The significant capital markets activity this quarter was the refinancing of our $550 million term loan and unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our initial 2011 plans called for the term loan to be addressed late in the year. However we decided to take advantage of attractive debt markets and we were very pleased with many of the credit facilities at the same time. Pricing on the new financings is very competitive, and over 100 basis points tighter from last year with, a spread to LIBOR of 170 basis points on the term loan, and 165 basis points on the credit facilities. These spreads are based on Moody's and S&P's credit ratings, which can improve as we work to regain our consensus in less than grade credit rating. We also took the opportunity to fix LIBOR on $100 million of the new $500 million term loan, and to be named to an interest rate swapped contract that fixes LIBOR at 1% through June 2014. At the end of the second quarter, only 13% of our total consolidated debt is variable-rate, which is consistent with our objective of having approximately 10% to 20% of our debt at floating rates. Equally as important as the cost of our debt is its duration. And these financings result in much better balance maturity schedule than ever before. At June 30, our weighted average debt maturity was 4.5 years, a significant improvement from 3.1 years at the end of last year's second quarter. Further, there are no years in which consolidated debt maturities exceed $1 billion. For a company of our size, with relatively stable and long-term revenue streams and a track record for raising over $2 billion of capital per annum recently, our debt maturities going forward are very manageable and our cost of capital is clearly competitive again. We are also taking advantage of the competitive market for property financings. Early next month we will close on a $75 million tenure mortgage secured by a lifestyle center in the Chicago MSA. Interest on this mortgage is fixed at 4.8% and it replaces a $60 million loan priced at 5.6%. Shortly after that financing, we expect to close a $65 million 10-year mortgage secured by a Power Center in New Jersey. Interest on this mortgage is fixed at 5.4%, and this replaces a $37 million loan with an interest rate of 7%. Closing these financings will further improve our weighted average debt maturity and average cost of debt. During the first half of the year, we raised more than $1.70 billion of new debt and equity capital, and it is encouraging to see our efforts to lower our risk profile and restructure our balance sheet rewarding. There is more work to do in pursuing our deleveraging goals, and we continue to expect to have pro rata debt to EBITDA ratio in the mid-7x range at the end of the fourth quarter and below-7x longer term. We will continue to actively pursue opportunities to lower leverage, and we expect to continue to make progress on this initiative without further dilution. We also continue to deliver on our capital recycling initiatives. For the first 6 months of the year, we have generated $155 million of gross proceeds through asset sales, our share of which was $107 million, which again exceeds our full year goal. We are deploying the proceeds from non-prime asset sales into the acquisition of prime shopping centers, which improves the quality of the portfolio on a balance-sheet  neutral basis. While our active disposition program presents some challenges predicting our near-term earnings, we are very confident that these efforts will result in a portfolio with better than average long-term growth prospects, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. We are being very diligent in underwriting potential acquisitions and despite a competitive market we are pleased to be finding select opportunities, which we expect to update you on later this quarter. We are very proud of the consistent execution on the strategic objectives that we've outlined for you over the past few years. And we will continue to make decisions that are in the best long-term interest of all of our stakeholders. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that Samir Khanal has recently agreed to join our team as Senior Director of Investor Relations. Samir is joining us from Morgan Stanley and has 8 years of experience covering the REITs as a sell-side  analyst, and knows commercial real estate in our sector very well. We are proud to be an industry leader in providing effective and transparent disclosure, and Samir's addition is an example of how committed we are to being proactive in this regard. We are confident he will further improve our investor communications, and make significant contributions to DDR overall. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, David. In closing, I'd like to reiterate our continued focus on maximizing internal growth opportunities while taking a disciplined approach to external growth. We are creatively sourcing prime acquisition opportunities with a primary focus on enhancing net asset value. Our reduced cost of capital and successful recapitalization of the balance sheet provides far greater financial flexibility to support these growth initiatives. Additionally we are encouraged by the level of demand we are seeing from retailers for new stores, and believe our ability to work cooperatively with our tenants as they seek to downsize and reconfigure their space will result in continued strength in our portfolio. Overall, our story is getting much clearer by the day, and we expect the positive momentum that we have enjoyed to continue. At this time, operator, we'd be happy to address any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Paul Morgan of Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: Just on the -- you went through the dispositions, could you break out -- is it a material impact on the portfolio occupancy, because you said they're under occupied as what, 700,000 square feet?
David Oakes: This quarter, there was not a material impact on the increase in occupancy for the quarter. We did have one prime center in the pool that was more highly leased than our portfolio average. We also had obviously the great majority of assets were non-prime assets with lower occupancy levels but overall it's just a small enough sample where there was no material impact, certainly nothing that would have been, I don't think even 10 basis points but certainly not more than that.
Daniel Hurwitz: There will be some situations though, Paul, where we have and will continue to sell assets that may be occupied at a higher level than the overall portfolio because we are uncertain whether it would remain there. So for example, we have assets that we have sold over 94% lease and we felt quite confident they'd go to 88% before they went to 95% so we'll continue to assess that on a case-by-case basis.
Paul Morgan: Would you say that -- I mean there's momentum in terms of the asset sales based on maybe the breadth of demand widening out, is this mostly just blocking and tackling, or is everything kind of one-off or do you think you could sell things on -- in your portfolio?
Daniel Hurwitz: I think there's a couple of ways to look at it. Most of it would be one-off, one- or two-off, but one of the things that you have to keep in mind is that we've sold over $2 billion worth of assets in the last couple of years. So our actual roster of assets to sell has gotten much smaller over time. So the idea of doing a large portfolio is going to be much more difficult because, again, the size of the portfolio that's left to sell has dwindled somewhat because of our successful execution on the disposition side and the quality of what we're selling now tends to be on the lower side as well. So I think you could fairly well expect us to maintain a one-off or maybe two-off sort of transactional pace, to get to our $100 million a year of dispositions. But I can't see a scenario in which asset dispositions will accelerate, given what's left to sell.
David Oakes: We're being more selective in terms of pricing when you think about sources and uses with the current time, the uses of proceeds being the redevelopment pipeline as well as prime acquisitions. Redevelopments represent attractive high-return opportunities. Acquisitions as we all know are very competitively priced for the most part at this time, so that means we need to be price sensitive on the sale side also, which is a difference relative to 2 years ago, when the more we could accelerate any sales, the more we could repurchase our debt at dramatic discounts to par where today we're much more disciplined simply because of the use of proceeds. We have to be much more careful. And so that's what you're seeing show up in the sale results and the more attractive pricing that we're achieving.
Paul Morgan: My other question is on Borders and not so much just within your portfolio because your portfolio's relatively limited but just more broadly speaking, do you think -- just your color on the way retailers are going to view this space and kind of how that may evolve over the second half of the year as it all becomes available. I mean do you think that retailers are more likely to increase their store openings because it's becoming available, they've been waiting on the sidelines for the space for a while? Or is it sort of kind of already embedded in expectations, and the fact that it's coming available earlier may mean other deals people might have in the works may get postponed?
Daniel Hurwitz: I think the last point you made, Paul. It's clearly been anticipated, it's not going to change anything in terms of the available space dynamic and it's not going to move the needle much on the supply side either. It's been anticipated. We've been working as I'm sure every landlord with Borders in their portfolio has, on the entire portfolio. We've had deals in LOI stage while Borders was still in bankruptcy and we just hope to execute those quickly but that's really what's happened. Nobody's surprised that it turned into a liquidation. And I don't see anybody ramping up their open to buy plans but at the same time they knew that this would be an available source for dealing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann of Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: Maybe a question for David. As you look at the midpoint of the narrowed range for guidance for the year, I guess taking the first half run rate, can you walk us through some of the factors that might move you perhaps to the upper end? I mean, you look at occupancy, I guess they expect it to be 93.2% at the end of the year. You have seen a nice tick-up in same-store NOI and leasing spreads have improved as well but what are you looking toward that could put you at the upper end of the range?
David Oakes: I mean there's not a ton of time left in the year for new long-term leasing but there's obviously a constant process in terms of how do we maximize the cash flow from the portfolio. Or we could think about certain acceleration of lease payments whether that's just getting someone open earlier and select cases where we've got demand for the space. For lease termination it's also, we've probably been more active than anyone  of the industry on the ancillary-income  side but there's still an opportunity to add additional income for later in the year. And then some of it just relates to the budget process where,  while we are pleasantly surprised every day and happy to see LIBOR stay at the 25 basis-point level, it's  certainly not the way that we budget anymore. And so to the extent we do see rates stay lower, it is helpful. That said, you've got some currents on the other side too and that's why we've maintained a range that we think is appropriate, where we do not foresee any reasonable circumstances where we'd fall outside of that and continue to target the midpoint of that range for the outcome of this year despite the fact that we've pulled asset  sales forward, we've pulled refinancings forward and it's not at all unreasonable to assume that if we think it's the right thing to do for the company long-term, then we will continue to do that. And that could still have an impact on our cost later in the year.
Jonathan Habermann: I guess with bad debt trending down year-over-year, have you seen any sort of changes in terms of store closings or expectations changing at all for the back half of the year?
David Oakes: No I think we've got factored in everything that we anticipate, Jay, we really don't see anything -- obviously something we watch very closely with any category that we view at risk but the guidance we're talking about clearly reflects any modifications for the Borders and Blockbusters and closings such as that.
Daniel Hurwitz: One of the things also Jay that we're very active on is obviously on the ancillary-income  side so if you take a situation like we had Borders where it was not fully anticipated that they would abandon all their stores before year end, we've already replaced that income that we would lose in 2011 with ancillary income and temporary tenants. So we've mentioned a number of times that the aggressive nature of our new business development platform and our ancillary income platform helps us mitigate risks in the event that we have a negative surprise. And this is a perfect example of it. If we had not been able to replace Borders' that are closing with temporary tenants, we would have lost somewhere around $250,000 in revenue between the end of September and the end of the year but again we've already backfilled that space assuming we get it back when we think we will. And that's part of our platform that we think helps mitigate the risk of future downside.
Jonathan Habermann: And my second question just on the development on hold, can you give us some sense there in terms of, I guess any sort of updated thoughts on that investment,  the $530 million?
Daniel Hurwitz: On the development part of it, Jay, we're still looking. We're not overly excited about getting anything going soon. I think we last spoke to you guys on the first quarter call about taking a good look at recon in Vegas in May, and seeing what the appetite was. And there's clearly interest and appetite and it is all about locking up the anchor tenants but I'll be honest with you, we're not looking to get anything  out of the ground anytime soon. We do know in some cases, it's going to be the best way to monetize that land. But we're being patient with it. We're going to wait for the right rate, for the right return, and we'll move forward once we're satisfied. We feel it coming but it's not there yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wigginton of DISCERN.
David Wigginton: David, you, in your commentary mentioned your objective of getting to midsize in time I think for your debt to EBITDA ratio, are you still operating on the premise that you're going to continue to lower that ratio primarily as a result of increasing EBITDA? Or are you planning on lowering debt as well, maybe through new equity or free cash flow?
David Oakes: The overwhelming majority of the improvement that we forecasted for the rest of the year or for future years is from EBITDA growth. Selectively there will still be debt reduction. Debt reduction's been the primary driver of the improvement in this metric the past couple of years. On a go-forward basis we think EBITDA growth would be the larger driver, would not expect at all equity debt reductions through equity issuance or the issuance of new common shares. But could think about that through the effective creation of new equity either by the low payout ratio that continues to result in considerable free cash flow, some of which gets reinvested in the portfolio but some of which could also be used to repay additional debt. Also the monetization of non income-producing assets, which for covenants and debt to EBITDA ratio purposes works at least as well as the issuance of new common equity so there might be select  improvements  on the debt reduction side that would not at all expect that to be through the issuance of common equity, but more so would expect  improvement in EBITDA to be the larger driver there.
David Wigginton: So on the EBITDA front then, I guess your EBITDA has been ticking down sequentially with the disposition activity in the portfolio, and obviously you've got a pretty wide spread between your leased and in condensed rate as well. And you're generating pretty decent rent growth. How does that all balance out and actually get you to your goal?
David Oakes: The EBITDA reduction on a total portfolio basis year-to-date has been partially driven by the dispositions falling earlier in the year in the acquisitions while we exceeded our disposition goal for the year. We are still -- have some work to do to get to our acquisition goal. So I think that's part of it. Some of it's also just going to be the importance of seasonality. Second quarter is basically the seasonally lightest quarter for us in terms of EBITDA, both relating to tenant schedules for the most natural time for closing stores as well as opening stores for retailers as well as the amount of ancillary income that's created in various quarters. And so we would hesitate to use the second quarter as the right way to think about the run rate there, where we think about the fourth quarter even just the seasonality of it, besides  the point you mentioned, on that considerable volume of leasings  been signed but yet to commence cash flowing. We think all those factors combine to get us much improved on that metric over the next several quarters.
David Wigginton: So then based on what you just said, is your pace of acquisition  going to outpace the rate of dispositions? For the remainder of the year?
David Oakes: Over the remainder of the year the budget has the pace of acquisitions exceeding the pace of dispositions. We mentioned previously we're under contract on $85 million of acquisitions, which will represent the majority, if not all of what we complete before year end.
David Wigginton: Final follow-up to that is, can you give us an idea what the spread between your acquisition and disposition cap rates have been year to date, and kind of where you see that going for the remainder of the year.
David Oakes: Year to date the spread has been approximately 50 basis points from the mid-7s on the acquisition side, to the high-7s, low-8s on the dispositions side. Going forward, we would assume it would be somewhere between that 50 and 100 basis-point  range. There are going to be selected positions that trade well wide of that. There are going to be certain dispositions that trade well inside of that where we're able to reinvest the proceeds on an accretive basis, but net based on the significant increase in quality from what we're buying versus what we're selling, we would expect it to be something in that 50 to 100 basis-point  range. It's also for the relatively low volume relative to prior years that you're seeing that sell and the greater pricing discipline that we've shown there.  I think we're generating better pricing on the dispositions and we're also not at all pressured to force ourselves in anything on the acquisition side where we're unwilling to compromise our underwriting pricing discipline there. And so that's why you are seeing amidst the overwhelming majority of assets that trade simply because we think the pricing is particularly aggressive but the select opportunities we find, we think can actually show a pretty modest spread between the cap rates on what we're buying and what we're selling. And we think looking out a year or 2, you more than make up for that on a higher growth profile of what we're buying, at the NOI stream of we're buying.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.
Christy McElroy: Paul, I just wanted to follow up on your comments about the 250,000 square feet of space you should get back over the next 3.5 years. Does this represent only the Best Buy space? Or are there other retailers in there that might be downsizing? And are these estimates a result of direct discussions that you guys have had with Best Buy regarding future space needs and what retailers could potentially take that residual space?
Paul Freddo: The number's clearly Best Buy related only Christy. And it is in discussions with them. Now it was used as an example, in fact we had these guys in our office this week going through the entire portfolio, but one of the things I wanted to emphasize is there's a way to be cooperative with your major retailers. It's not all downside. And we're working closely with these guys to figure out how to get this done. So that number comes specifically through conversations with Best Buy. There's a lot of the devil's in the detail, obviously, in finding the right replacements. And as I mentioned in the script, it's going to be our call at the end of the day and Best Buy gets that. There are several retailers -- we haven't gotten to the length we had with Best Buy yet, but all of the office guys, and again not every location is oversized. Jo-Ann Fabrics is another example in the arts and crafts side. But anybody who's downsizing,  this is something we are regularly reviewing throughout our entire portfolio, treat it as an opportunity, get proactive with it and let's get them in here and discuss it. And trust me, the retailers love that approach.
Christy McElroy: So as a result of those types of discussions in addition to Best Buy, how much space could that potentially be in the aggregate over the next 3 to 5 years?
Paul Freddo: We don't really know. We haven't gotten that far, Christy, and again it's going to be -- not everybody has been as clear as Best Buy in their releases in terms of what they're looking to downsize to and from. So it's a little simpler with the Best Buy. If they want to be 36,000 to 40,000 in every location, it's not hard to figure it out. But we don't have that, but it's something we're working on. And again the point is there's opportunity here, it's not all risk.
Daniel Hurwitz: There's a big gap, Christie, in the retail community between those that are talking about it and actually executing it and those that are quite frankly, talking about it because they think that's what the market wants to hear. Obviously, it's kind of like Best Buy. It's very proactive. They're working very aggressively. Like Paul said, they were here this week. We went through everything with them. We have a good working relationship, and we'll make progress. Some of the other tenants know that it's quite fashionable to talk about that. It's something they should do, but they are well behind some of their peers. And it's somewhat uncertain to us yet who's real in the downsizing effort, and who think it's fashionable to talk about a downsizing effort.
Christy McElroy: And just following up on the second part of my question, we've heard names like Trader Joe's or Sephora being thrown out there, as retailers that could potentially take the residual space. Are you seeing any other retailers sort of popping up?
Paul Freddo: There's quite a few. I mean, Ulta heads the list, Christy. I mean Trader Joe's and Sephora are clearly there but Ulta. Carter's is in an aggressive growth boat, and they're specifically asking us, ""Where can we get space that some of your larger tenants want to downsize?"" Five Below, Dot's, the Dress Barn, these are all guys that are looking for space in that category that,  call it 8,000 to 10,000 feet.
Christy McElroy: And then just following up on your projected $750 million of redevelopment opportunities. Can you give a sense for how the timing of the investment would play out over the next 5 years and expected returns on investment?
Paul Freddo: On terms of timing, clearly it's going to ramp-up as we go into the out years. We're planning to spend somewhere around $45 million in 2011, really just the genesis of the program. But it ramps up pretty significantly in the later years.
Christy McElroy: And returns?
David Oakes: Returns that on average are certainly going to be in the double digits. Selectively, you might have a few that are below that but the overwhelming majority and certainly the weighted average are going to end up in the double digits, low teens sort of area.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Macquarie.
Ki Kim: Could you break out the same-store  NOI performance between your various regions, meaning Brazil and the U.S., and maybe Puerto Rico.
David Oakes: The biggest spread is with Brazil where it's been by far the strongest. Results down there continue to be in the mid-teens range and so well in excess of what we're able to achieve elsewhere or U.S. and Puerto Rico has generally been in mid-2% range.
Ki Kim: And the positive lease thread is that also driven by Brazil or is that more equal?
David Oakes: That is much more equal. There's going to be  less of an impact there, both the volume of leasing, they're signing on a quarterly basis. As well as, our leasing spreads for the Brazilian portfolio are significantly understated relative to the real economic growth because we get annual escalators. So you're seeing that NOI show up every year but it's not -- or NOI growth show up every year but it's not showing up in a rental spread. So rental spreads down there are good, but significantly understate the real economic growth because you're getting that contractual bump every year. And so on the spread side there's really not much impact and not much...
Daniel Hurwitz: And I may add to David's point, that it is really carried by the U.S. and Puerto Rico, the domestic portfolio on the spreads.
Ki Kim: If you can provide some quick commentary on Florida, is that market picking up?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's soft, softer than most, let me put it that way. There's a little bit of pickup, but we're seeing better pickup in Georgia and the Carolinas. So in terms of the small-shop  space, we've seen the same success in the box space down in Florida that we had experienced in the most places. But the small shop, that's really been the hardest hit and continues to be the slowest to come back. We are seeing some recovery in the shop space, but the Carolinas and Georgia have really carried that.
Ki Kim: Just diving a little bit deeper into your portfolio, it looks like the space that is greater than 20,000 square feet, occupancy increased about 40 bps to 96.3. And I'm guessing that had a lot to do with the overall portfolio, obviously, gains and things like NOI especially in the U.S. Given that it's kind of approaching that structural level of upper 90s, for the next year going forward what are the incremental -- I guess, how do you get continuous 3%, 3.5% NOI growth with large-base  being almost fully occupied?
Daniel Hurwitz: But I would tell you also that don't look at a 95 or 96 in that box space as fully occupied. It's always been a much higher percent lease than the corporate average, but there's clearly still upside. We've got 2.5 million square feet approximately of space in that north of 10 or 20 and there's lots of opportunity there. We honestly believe we can get that up in the 98% range, and we'll do it. I mean there's still lots of activity, lots of demand, lots in our pipeline. And there's also the opportunity in the small shop. We, historically, got to a high in that less than 5,000 square feet, in the high 80s. So we're sitting as we said just below 83. There's room there too. So combined we think there's plenty of upside for the foreseeable future.
David Oakes: And remember that from a same-store  NOI perspective where we're switching from talking about square footage as you guys had been talking about NOI, those smaller spaces, while they have been tougher and as Paul mentioned, their occupancy naturally is going to be somewhat lower over time. They do generate higher rent per square foot and maybe approximately 2x the rent per square foot. So you need a smaller amount of progress in that bucket to still make a very large contribution of same-store NOI.
Ki Kim: And I noticed you guys provided a little bit more breakout on the small-shop space.  You guys cleared [ph] it out a little more. But if you could compare it on an apples-to-apples basis over the last quarter, what was the incremental increase on occupancy or decrease?
Paul Freddo: It was up but slightly quarter-to-quarter in the small-shop  space, but there's something we're going track more closely. We've  broken it down a little finer, and that's part of the intention in the supplement given to show a further breakdown, so we'll be able to track this a lot closer. It's worth making a couple of other points on that small-shop  space. We actually had our highest spreads in the quarter in that space, and our renewal spreads, of which there's a significant amount of renewals within the year, were solid in this category also. So I don't want to sit here and say that everything is rosy in the small-shop  space because it's not but there's certainly improvement and a lot of upside.
Ki Kim: Just last question, given just the general negative headlines and commenting on a lot of risk out there, how much, if you could somewhat quantify or qualitatively, how much demand do you think is out there that's just waiting for things to clear up before they pull the trigger?
Daniel Hurwitz: Very little. I'll tell you, as unsettled as the macro situation is,we have been consistently pleased by how steadfast the retailers have been and how consistent they've been in seeking space. We don't get the sense some of like you do often on the investment side or the capital-market  side, that there is a wall of demand out there waiting for something positive to happen. I think it's quite the opposite in the retail community. I think the retailers understand that even though the macro situation is uncertain, and may not be as stable as they would like, I think the availability of space is even less certain for them and they know if they don't act now they're going to have a real problem in the foreseeable future and as a result, that has maintained a level of interest in space that we think really will continue number one, and number two has as surprised us with its consistency. I think it's also one of the things that when you talk to tenants that are looking to downsize, it surprises them too, because as they go out and they talk to other tenants as well, they're surprised by the demand for space, and that gives them the ability to accomplish their downsizing goals in a manner in  which they've outlined.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Dan, just wanted to get your sort of big-picture  take. A lot of talk with Amazon and Internet sales not being taxed, if it's just purely online without the brick and mortar presence, do you have any sense as you speak to your various tenants, how many sales -- how much sales they actually lose because people are deciding instead to buy it online rather than walk into a brick and mortar store. And I don't mean tenants like a Best Buy who are choosing to buy it on their website versus walking in the store. I'm talking the Amazons, the Gilts, et cetera?
Daniel Hurwitz: H It's a good point, it's a good question. Because one of the things that you're seeing, which you might intuitively think when you talk about the impact of Internet sales, is an overall decline in comp store sales at the asset level, and we're not seeing that. So the question you almost have to ask yourself is are they taking my piece of the pie or is the pie actually getting larger? And  most tenants will tell you, that online sales are supporting the bricks and mortars sales and contributing dramatically to the comp-store  bricks and mortar number because there's a lot of browsing that goes on, on the Internet, a lot of  buying that goes on in the store. So I don't think  most of them feel that it's taking away from bricks and mortar, forgetting like you said Best Buy, and particularly in the ready-to-wear sector where most people like to touch and feel clothing before they buy it. I think most of them feel from our conversations that the  Internet proposition is supportive of the bricks and mortar and is complementary to bricks and mortar, and hasn't really taken away from the sales of the bricks and mortar the way, intuitively, we might think that it would.
Alexander Goldfarb: So like the, using Amazon as an example, is that something more like sort of books related, where a whole category has sort of migrated online and most categories, your tenants aren't  seeing people shop exclusively at online-only  retailers?
Daniel Hurwitz: I think that's right. I do think there's a difference though. I think there's a difference between categories that are vulnerable because they're flawed, versus categories that provide just an alternative shopping experience the consumers may or may not take advantage of. We've said for many years we've had this discussion that we've always been concerned about commodity goods that are at very, very low margins. And the fact that there is a more efficient distribution channel being, in particular the Internet or in some cases a catalog, versus bricks and mortar. We talked about some of those sectors  and we're seeing that come to fruition. It doesn't surprise us and doesn't really concern us. It's actually just part of the evolution of retail. It's what we deal with every day. So I think category by category, if you take a look at it, our goal is to obviously identify the winners and the losers. And we feel that from a competitive standpoint, those commodity goods, that thin margins with inefficient distribution channels are the ones that will continue to struggle and eventually, I think they'll disappear.
Alexander Goldfarb: My second question is for David. In your discussion with the rating agencies, you've done the term loan, you did the line of credit, are there any next steps that they are looking for? Or is it purely just sort of getting to some sort of EBITDA metric or something, or some sort of threshold like that?
David Oakes: I think the major steps are done at this point. Everything we've outlined to them in terms of major individual transactional activity has been accomplished over the past couple of years, and in general has been accomplished at better execution than we originally budgeted with various models that we would have shared with them. And so, we are pleased that you've seen positive rating agency activity from each one of the 3 major agencies. And so we are seeing it move in the right direction. It's never going to be as rapid as we might like to reflect the progress that we certainly are confident that we're making every day. But we have seen progress there, we think there will be more, and some of it as you mentioned is just a process of seeing the EBITDA growth over time. While some of the capital-markets activity  is something you can go and do in a week or a month, and the transaction is completed, on the leasing side, it's obviously a much longer-term process of getting a good tenant in place and cash flowing. And so it's been a process over time of showing more and more progress there. And  we expect that to continue, and we expect the positive feedback to continue.
Alexander Goldfarb: So from just our perspective, is midyear next year is that sort of reasonable for thinking that one of the other 2 may also upgrade you guys to investment grade, or is that a little too ambitious?
David Oakes: I don't want to avoid the question but the reality is it's better placed with them than with us. We certainly can control how hard we push on the metrics and there is a constant and urgent focus on that, and a strong dialogue with each of the agencies. We've talked about having the metrics comfortably in place during 2012. When the ratings come is uncertain. And obviously when you overlie  some of the crazy mattress stuff going on right now, where whether it's the agencies or any fixed-income  investor in the world being dramatically more focused about the U.S. sovereign situation than DDR's credit rating, I think it makes it even harder to forecast it.  So what we can control is the metrics and how hard we push and with how much urgency. We push on continued improvement there, and you can assume that we are working extremely diligently on that. When the ratings come, I don't think it's something we want to handicap.
Alexander Goldfarb: Well at least they're discussing upgrading you guys and not the other way around.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Craig Schmidt: Looking at certain retailers, and for one I'm thinking of TJX, who have pretty aggressive open to buys, in their case, over 100 stores in '12 and '13. In your discussions how are they planning to do that? Are they planning to build freestanding stores or go to lower quality strip centers? What is the game plan?
Daniel Hurwitz: Haven't heard about them building any of their own, Craig, but they're -- listen, they know it's a very aggressive plan but the success of the Marshals and the T.J. Maxx and HomeGoods has a lot of runway also because it's not out there in a big way in terms of number of stores. So you're going to see a lot of HomeGoods being done, but this is the kind of conversation I think I've had with many of you individually. It's a great question, how are you going to get it done? And you get a little bit out of a Borders bankruptcy. They'll each grab a few, but not a lot, but they're going to have to be aggressive, and they're going to have to be creative. And that gets back to the flexibility story where you're going to see them smaller stores, smaller markets. So trust me that they're  all looking at their research and thinking out if we thought we could do X number in a metro market maybe it's that plus 10 and because they can be closer together with a smaller format. Or just a smaller market in terms of population. And that's the kind of thing you're going to see from a TJ. You know they're blowing and going with a core [indiscernible] strategy, which wasn't there 2 years ago. So it all adds up, but they know they have their work cut out for them. It's not an easy task.
Craig Schmidt: And then just given the dispositions obviously, your store count by retailer is falling, but it seems to be falling the most aggressively for what I would say kind of your more challenged retailers. And given your comments today Paul, I would assume that when you're looking at dispositions, you're not only looking at some secondary markets but you're looking at those centers with maybe some troubled real estate retailers?
Paul Freddo: Absolutely, Craig, and that would include not only dispositions but potential terminations. I mean reducing our exposure to the retailers that we believe are at risk. Dan alluded to it a little bit talking about the Internet is an important part of what we are doing. The more quality we have in the portfolio, the better quality the overall portfolio is but you hit it on the head. It's something we look at regularly, and again not only in the disposition.
Daniel Hurwitz: The single biggest factor is going to be what we think the NOI profile is over the next several years. And so you can see or you can imagine that would be highly aligned with some of what we believe to be the more challenged tenants and how can we  take a price that might not feel like the ideal cap rate today but based on what we expect the NOI stream to be 2 to 5 years down the road. It is dramatically better pricing today than we think we could achieve in the future so that's been the process on our side and that's why you see some of the more challenged retailers getting smaller on that one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman of Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: In terms of sources and uses in the next few years and sort of this opportunity for growth, and Dan, I think that you clearly articulated it in your opening comments. You think the best of redevelopment, it sounds like you have a number of acquisitions that are lined up. You have the development property, which doesn't sound like you're going to start, but clearly that would require capital at some point or I guess you  could just write it off or sell it. But probably more of a capital need. It seems like there's a lot more capital need than capital uses. And I also think about the dividend, which obviously you kept low but eventually you're taxable income is going to revert as you take in some of the depreciation that you're going to be required to have a higher dividend that what you're paying now, so it would seem that there's a lot of capital needs and I'm just curious how you think about sourcing that capital and how much capital that is, but also the cost of capital. Because I think, you've spent a lot of time on the call talking about your -- what you think is a more competitive cost of capital. I'm just curious how you think about where that is across the different capital sources that you would have.
David Oakes: I don't think we would completely agree that the uses over the next several years are well in excess of the sources. I do think particularly on the redevelopment side that we're seeing a greater volume of opportunity than we expected a few years ago just because the retailer interest is much greater in terms of funding that. You were exactly right. It's thus far an extremely low dividend payout ratio, it's been an important source of capital. We don't take that lightly and we don't expect that to be the long-term case that we would keep the dividend this low. We do still think we'll generate some volume of free cash flow in any given period although we would expect the dividend payout ratio to be much higher than it is today in the not too distant future but even with that we still expect some amount of free cash flow. We continue to make progress on asset sales, whether those proceeds go to fund  acquisitions, to the extent we can find select opportunities or whether those proceeds are reinvested in redevelopments. And then finally, on the development side, we probably do view that at least as much as a source of capital as of a use of capital because even some of the projects we decide to move forward with as was the case with the 2 redevelopments we announced a couple of months ago, the first step in that process is a pad sale to a major anchor. And so I think we can see development projects move forward on a cash-flow  positive basis to DDR even if some of that cash ends up getting reinvested, some or all of that cash ends up getting reinvested in the project, it doesn't necessarily mean that the only way you can see us go vertical on the site is by putting net more capital in. And so whether it's the project that moves forward while we're selling pads or whether it's just some of the other monetization of non income-producing assets, we think that can be a pretty significant source of proceeds. Over the next couple of years, let's also remember that while the $750 million of predevelopment is a relatively large headline number and one that we think is very achievable, we are talking about a 5-year period there and so there's a long period of time to generate proceeds from those other sources to fund that and I think we'd also reiterate, given everything we've lived through over the past few years not only is focus on the management team and the board to continue to operate with a lower risk profile but we've also just put a lot more systems, modeling, risk controls, enterprise risk management in place where you asking this question is refreshing because it's something we talk about quite a bit internally. It's no longer a situation where you're bringing up something that could present a risk but that we haven't talked about, it's exactly that we spent time internally and you can absolutely assume that we're not going to push forward on anything that we don't believe is very, very appropriately funded with proceeds that we got identified from one of the sources we talked about. We are pleased that our cost to capital has improved. We also know the only way that, that will continue to be the case is if we continue to operate with great discipline to keep our debt spreads low by not being too reliant on that source of capital and to continue to get to a more attractive price of equity. And my understanding's that the very high cost of common equity versus other means to generate those proceeds.
Michael Bilerman: I guess how much will equity factor into that? I mean clearly, when you took up the preferreds earlier this year that there's an equity swap. How much more sort of equity do you want to put back into the system. You're not at your EBITDA -- debt to EBITDA target yet. You're on target to get there through the EBITDA growth over the next 12 months but clearly things are going to be have to be match funded. Equity in your assets is one piece, but the only other equity sources is common equity. So how should we think about, at what point you see that as an option?
Daniel Hurwitz: I don't think we have any near-term  plans to use that as an option. I mean we're obviously consistently thinking about the cost of various forms of capital. We do understand that if there is net asset growth, that there is an equity requirement. But for us, we continue to believe that other sources of effective equity are dramatically cheaper than the issuance of new common shares and so when we think about the monetization of non-income producing assets, which for covenant purposes and for debt to EBITDA purposes serve at least as attractively as the issuance of new equity as well as the generation of free cash flow through even a normalized payout ratio. The capital that would come out of that,  I think those are what we prioritize more highly as the forms of equity that we would be likely to include as part of funding any net growth that you might see in terms of net asset growth.
Michael Bilerman: Just a clarification on same-store NOI. You show your same-store NOI on a growth share basis, as if you own 100%, of all joint ventures. And clearly with Brazil being a large portion, of which you only own 1/3 of, if you were to strip it down to your pro rata share of same-store NOI, what would that growth be? What would happen to that 3.6, and then break it out further between what would U.S. be and what would Brazil be?
David Oakes: If you take Brazil out, which is obviously an outlier on the high side, it's going to reduce that NOI figure. However, if you take out some of our other large joint ventures, they've been generating lower same-store NOI growth either because of the specific assets they own or because of the fact that less capital has been invested in some of those centers to fund new leasing activity. So some of those, the removal of some of the other large joint ventures would actually help if you went to a pro rata basis. All in, you would take the 3.6% for the quarter, the 3.8% year-to-date down 75 basis points to 100 basis points, depending  on what period you're looking at to think about the true pro rata basis in the mid- to high-2% range.
Michael Bilerman: And that's with Brazil and then you take out U.S. and U.S. would probably be 1.5%?
David Oakes: No, U.S. would be in excess of 2%.
Michael Bilerman: Even though Brazil is 10% of the total, and was up 15% wouldn't that be 1.5% growth?
David Oakes: Year-to-date, from the U.S. portfolio overall we're north of 2% and if you take out the joint ventures or if you reduce the influence of the joint ventures that are lower than the consolidated portfolio. And so if you reduce that to a pro rata share you'd be somewhere in the low 2s.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly of Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Just a few follow-ups, considering the redevelopment pipeline, I was just curious at  some of the common themes were behind the value creation there. Is it really just following through I guess I'll call them the deferred CapEx, that could be just like facelifts to centers or are these expansions like adding grocers or creating outparcels that you're looking at?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's not deferred CapEx, Jeff, it really comes from a couple of different areas. It is expansions of certain centers, it's reconfiguring space. But what's really driving this is tenant demand and tenant flexibility. We've had situations in centers for a long time, in particular the one center in Denver that we announced in the June press release, and we've owned that for a long time, and we really had no luck redeveloping that even though we've tried for about the last 7 years to do so but tenants' demand is up. It's a great location and tenants need to be flexible in order to achieve their open to buy goals, getting back to Craig's question of how they're going to do it, and how they're going to hit their goals is they're going to be flexible on the redevelopment side and look at existing space differently than they've looked at it in the past. So that has really been the impetus behind the growth of redevelopment because we now have space that may not have been considered viable in the past that's not only considered viable but is highly desirable. And that's going to continue, I think, to fuel the growth, because like Paul said, the development of new space is really not going to be significant at any level any time soon.
Jeffrey Donnelly: I'm just curious, Dan,  do you think anchors are, their expectations around rents are adjusting, I guess I'll say quickly? Certainly there was a drop on the asking rents from the prior peak to the trough of the cycle. How quickly do you think their expectations are adjusting on the way back up?
Daniel Hurwitz: It's coming back. They're not adjusting up as quickly as they adjusted  down of course. And if you were a tenant you would do the same thing. But we are starting to see pricing power return to the portfolio. You've  seen it in the spreads. We think that will continue because I think when you asked a question, how are you going to meet your growth goals? The short answer from a lot of tenants is they're not really sure how they're going to do that and that means they're going to have to become more flexible, they're going to have to become more aggressive on price. Those of us with some space are going to be a little more patient. And hopefully that will drive the rentals back to close to where they were. I don't know if we'll get back to the peak 2007 days, but our goal would be to get as close as we can get in as short a period of time as we can but rents clearly don't climb quite as quickly as they drop.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Just a second question maybe for David, what's the volume of non income-producing assets that you guys have on your balance sheet out there and separately maybe as a follow-up to the priors, do you attribute the traction in shop-space  leasing, I guess I'll call it, and pricing specific to the pickup in your anchor occupancy? Or is it something just more macro going on?
David Oakes: First on the non income-producing  assets, you're going to be less than the $1 billion number we've talked about historically just as we've modified a portion of that. I think that was the headline number we started talking about a year ago. You're still going to be approximately 10% of the balance sheet so something in that $850 million-plus  range some of  which will be possible to monetize near term, some of which could be quite a ways off but all in the way I still think about it is approximately 10% of the balance sheet, non-expedition assets.
Daniel Hurwitz: And the other part of the question, Jeff, clearly there's been some improvement in leasing of the small-shop  space because of the filling of  vacant boxes for example. There's no secret that when you have a better mousetrap with better quality anchors and draws you're going to achieve more success. The other thing we're seeing with the small shops, that there's been improved credit available, but it's not overwhelming. We're seeing great pickup in franchisees and as we've seen in the franchise companies play bank. They know they have to lend to their respective franchisees if they're going to grow so we've seen some improvement in that but there is clearly a relationship to an improved center in terms of the leasing progress in the small-shop  space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: Jeff got most of my questions on the redevelopments, but maybe one thing, of the $750 million, about how many projects does that include?
Daniel Hurwitz: A significant number of projects, Michael. They run the range from -- we can have one at maybe in the $40-million or $50-million  range and we've got some that are in the $5 million to $10 million. I would say most of them are going to be in that $10 million range. So as we go along, we're seeing some more that are significant spends. We had some initially, which were even in the $2.5 million to $5 million spend but a lot of the things, and I don't think we hit on it yet, one of the areas we're working is where we are converting small-shop  space to anchor space. I mean that clearly is a redevelopment and the right thing for the asset and it's a great upside to the NOI. But in terms of an exact number, we have not pinned that down at this point.
Michael Mueller: And then on the new leasing spreads, I understand the rationale for focusing more on the lease, I guess the lease-spreads  space that's been vacant less than 12 months but if you would throw in the vacancies greater than 12 months, how different would the lease spreads be?  They would still be positive, correct?
David Oakes: Absolutely. They'd be less but they'd still be positive. It's not a calculation we're doing anymore, Michael. But I think more importantly, as I've talked about on a few occasions is that the rents are up quarter-over-quarter. So the first year starting rent, you can see that right in the -- there's an improvement in first year rents whether it's vacant for a year or not or greater. So we're seeing that. And the other thing is, again, I keep coming back to that renewal spread. That is a big, big deal and something we should all be focused on, and it continues to grow. I'm very confident we'll stay positive. New deal spreads, you'll see some bouncing around. It's going to be a function of the deals made in any quarter. Renewals, we're seeing consistent improvement in the renewal spreads and that is a big deal. And as leasing gets better for obvious reasons, less chance of risk of people threatening to walk away and more and more taking their options.
Daniel Hurwitz: And to Paul's point, Mike, the importance of the renewal spread, which is where we spend most of our time focused is simply that's the vast majority of the activity in the quarter depending on the quarter or depending on even the year if you go back and look it's between 75% and 80% of our total activity is on renewals. So the renewal spread number is the one that we focus on very closely that gives us a good indicator on overall health out there, number 1 what the retention rate is and number 2, how the renewal spreads work and that's the one that we've been most enthusiastic about as we've seen the recovery within the portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Sullivan of Cowen and Company.
James Sullivan: Two quick questions. First of all, kind of a follow-up to the commentary on spreads. I'm curious to what extent, if any, we keep hearing that retailer margins are going to be squeezed in the second half, apparel, food and some other categories. To what extent, if any, do the retailers mention this and push back in terms of any rental spreads. Is it something that just noise enters into negotiations or does it come up at all?
Paul Freddo: It's mentioned, Jim, but it doesn't carry a lot of weight. One of the things -- first of all, they're not all sure how these margins are going to be squeezed. We're all concerned and we're going into the back half now and there's a little bit of caution but we've yet to see the margin squeeze. I mean some of it is going to be predictable but the other thing when you're negotiating a rent with a tenant is a spike in cotton prices is not a forever situation. Rent is a long-term proposition and that's one of the things we remind them of. Just the fact that you had a spike in cotton, cotton's come down. We're not going to lock in a 10-year rental  based on the potential for margins being squeezed because of commodity pricing. Again, it comes up, it hasn't been a significant factor at this point.
James Sullivan: The second question really goes to one of the slides that is in your presentation that you gave in May reads, the Five-Year Plan slide call it, if you will, where you talk about same-store NOI on a,  I guess, a post-recovery  period a range of 1.5 to 2. And I guess I'm trying to square that with, when we look back over the last 10 years, the average same-store NOI growth was just a little below that even if we include 2009, and given all the commentary regarding focusing on improving significantly the average asset quality, the initiatives in terms of ancillary income and how successful they've been, that 1.5% to 2% number, and also presumably that includes the impact of what you're doing outside the U.S., it seems like that's a pretty conservative estimate. I'm just curious if you would comment on that?
Daniel Hurwitz: We agree. We think it's a conservative estimate, but of course that number as we are putting together the Five-Year Plan at the end of last year, quite frankly, there were a lot of initiatives that we had, that needed to go according to plan in order for us to meet those strategic initiatives over a five-year period of time. And a lot of things had to go right. The good news is a lot of things have gone right, and I would be disappointed if we couldn't beat that number going forward particularly with the improvement of the overall quality of the portfolio domestically. It's been  very, very significant. So I think your point is a good one. We don't want to put ourselves in a position where we overpromise and under deliver at any given time to this market and at the time that we put those numbers together we're looking at things and the risk involved and the execution, we felt that, that was the appropriate numbers. That was the appropriate number in the appropriate range. If we could beat it, I think that's great. But we also have to keep in mind that there are things in the market today that are still working against us that we need to overcome. And we'll continue to work towards beating all the numbers that we present to you.
James Sullivan: Just kind of a follow-up question. The redevelopment spending effort and initiative. Albeit it's going to be spread over many years, and there could be smaller projects and bigger projects. But I'm assuming that from a modeling standpoint, the contribution for that will be in addition to the same-store NOI growth.
Daniel Hurwitz: That is correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies & Company.
Omotayo Okusanya: Most of my questions have been answered. But just along Jim's line of questioning. When we do look back at the Five-Year Plan presented at the Investor Day, I know it's only 4 months into them, but could you talk a little bit how confident you are about hitting some of those marks and just at this point in the cycle how you would grade yourself relative to those initiatives that you're taking on?
David Oakes: You're exactly right. It's a short period of time since the plan was created late last year and since the plan was rolled out publicly at our Investor Day in March. That said, we're pushing hard every day to execute. We're pleased with the progress thus far through approximately 10%. But the period of time that we originally outlined in the plan, we still feel that the goals are achievable but on the other side of that no one here is going to be happy if we simply achieve those goals. So we're not just pushing to get there and take the last few years of that plan off. We're pushing to get there as quickly as possible and keep pushing beyond there so happy with execution over the first 6 months or so and expect to be able to show you a lot more as we look out over the next few quarters.
David Oakes: Just from a process perspective, we'll be reviewing that plan on an annual basis with our board as we do every -- at a board retreat every November. And we'll do it again this November, and we'll look at where we are right, we'll look at where we were wrong, we'll look at how the market has changed and how we'll need to adjust. And accordingly -- and obviously since we have a lot of communication with many of you on a regular basis, we'll be presenting you with changes to that plan based on what we see as market conditions that are either positive or negative.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore: Dave, I have a question for you on the mezzanine loan impairment. What was that exactly?
David Oakes: It was a sale of a loan that we had made approximately 4 years ago as part of a prior investment thesis and more of an FFO driven strategy to make some mezzanine loan investments that  can generate FFO. We still have a few of those on our books. This was one where we have the opportunity to either invest more capital and potentially, or likely get all of our principal out over a multiyear period of time or to exit earlier but accept less than the par amount on the loan. Given the non-retail underlying property type we certainly thought, while there was some economic rationale for further investment, we really thought with the strategic plan we've outlined, we talked about internally and externally that it made more sense to take some capital out, reinvest that proceeds in our core business rather than go further down the path with that specific mezz loan. The majority of the mezz loans or loans at all on our books today, a great majority are tied to high-quality  power centers and so while they might be wrapped in a little different portion of the capital stack, the underlying pieces of prime power centers is very much what the majority of that capital is invested in but still have a few vestiges of prior activity.
Richard Moore: So are you doing any more of those or is that not something that you guys are looking at? Any more new mezzanine loans?
David Oakes: Certainly not outside of the retail space. Selectively, I think especially as competitive as the acquisition market is, if we had looked to gain involvement in a high-quality project, then we have an interest in owning, and ability to own and manage attractively, we would certainly consider it but I would expect it to represent a small minority of our overall investment activity.
Richard Moore: And then when you guys look at dispositions. I know you had and you still have a portfolio that you're trying to get rid of as a block, how realistic-- it seems like I'm not hearing much in the way of interest, whether it's on the mall side or the community-center side, from buyers in a portfolio. Obviously they're interested in individual assets but the portfolio seems to be more difficult. What do you guys think about that?
Daniel Hurwitz: Our portfolios are more difficult and in particular today in our case, the quality of what's left to sell, because we've sold so much already is pretty low. And as a result, if you really look at some of the larger portfolio sectors that have sold, while you could argue that overall the quality may not have been overly high, there was some very high-quality assets contained that made a certain percent of the overall portfolio. A lot of what you're seeing out there today doesn't have any percentage of high-quality assets in the portfolio. And as a result, I think, astute buyers are recognizing that they'd be wiser to cherry pick than to buy en masse.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: What percent of your portfolio was actually occupied in the second quarter in paying rent?
Paul Freddo: 90.5%.
Carol Kemple: So is that spread a little tighter than from the first quarter?
Daniel Hurwitz: Just a little bit, Carol, 250 basis points and I believe we reported 240 basis points at the end of the first quarter. We should see that come down a little bit with the openings in the third and fourth quarter. Keep in mind that's a very seasonal number because very few tenants open in the first and second quarter, third quarter things pick up with back-to-school, and obviously in the fourth quarter everyone wants to be open.
Carol Kemple: And you all talked about earlier in the call that at some point you're going to have to raise the dividend, can you give any kind of timing or estimate of when you think that will be?
Daniel Hurwitz: Obviously dividend policy is a board decision. We've said publicly that until we had made  considerable progress reducing the risk profile of the balance sheet, that it was not something that management would recommend to the board. At this point I think we had really set that last step in that process, the refinancing of the term loan, the extension of that maturity and the removal of a large majority of the maturities from 2012 is being an important catalyst for that. We've clearly executed on that at this point and so we're much more open with that behind us to thinking about higher dividend and to recommending a higher dividend over the coming quarters.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Just a follow-up question. Just as we think about the longer-term occupancy ranges in that less than 5,000 square foot range in light of the redevelopment projects you've identified, I mean, how much of the vacancy improvement comes from those redevelopment projects where you're taking back some space maybe from those smaller tenants? And then outside of that, it seems like national, and regional tenants are really the ones that are sucking that space up and  small true mom and pops not really showing any signs of real growth. If that stays the case, is there enough demand from the national and regional players, the franchisees and whatnot  to take that back to the 80, 80-ish, call it normalized range?
Daniel Hurwitz: We're not getting that far ahead of it Vince, but it's clearly as I said earlier, we see 300 basis points of improvement, which would get us to about 86 in that category. Some of that, but not a significant amount yet, is because of redevelopment. I think I mentioned in the script in one of the projects in Puerto Rico, we actually took 4 vacant spaces, and vacant  for a significant amount of time and turned it into one PetSmart so that's where redevelopment did reduce that vacancy rate. But we've already seen the space. Keep in mind we're 2.5, 3 years beyond when this whole problem with small-shop  space started. So we've had a lot of fallout.  And to grow back is what we would expect, and again we're not getting crazy and thinking 88 is in the immediate future, but we certainly see a few 100 basis points of improvement there. And it is more national there's no doubt. But I say that, there's national change, also that our franchise changed. When you're dealing with mom and pops who are the franchisees at the end of the day, they're getting credit bills from those franchise companies, and that's a significant part of the growth received in that category.
Vincent Chao: But you think to get back to the 86 range even the 300 basis points, you think that can be done via the regionals and nationals where you're seeing a demand from today?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes.
Vincent Chao: You don't need the small -- the true mom and pops to come back to get there?
Daniel Hurwitz: No, but we're going to see some come back. We're not counting on it, but we will see some.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cedric Lechance [ph] of Green Street Advisors.
Unknown Analyst -: Just in regards to TI packages, you did a great job providing us the information on that front. Would you be able to give us an idea of the average TI package on a per square foot, per year for small shop tenants versus anchor tenants?
Daniel Hurwitz: The small shop, it's next to nothing, Cedric, I mean there's very little TI package in the small-shop  space. In the larger stuff, we've been re-tenanting the boxes that came back to us a few years ago. as we've said consistently, we've seen it come down but that could be in the $20, $25 a foot range. But when you average in the small shops, there's very little and in fact, in very few cases where we've got allowances for the small shops.
Unknown Analyst -: And just going back to one of the earlier comments you made, Paul, actually. So if you haven't seen the GAAP in terms of demand from retailers and availability of goods supply on your part for your entire career, it would  seem to suggest to me that either rents are going to spike quite dramatically at some point or that development is going to pick up. In which direction do you think we're most generally headed?
Paul Freddo: Rents. I would tell you that I don't know that spike up is the word I'd use, but it's been consistent improvement over the last 2.5 years, Cedric. We're seeing it enter the conversations we have every day. There's not enough development even when if that comes back, that's  going to move the needle on that supply side. That's a big thing to remember on this. We're just not going to see retailers chase future residential growth, which isn't there, and nobody knows when it's going to come back. So limited development will take some of the demand. But we're going to see growth in rent. It's that simple.
Daniel Hurwitz: I think it's also important, Cedric, to keep in mind that on the development side, the entitlement risk out there is still great. People talk about development almost like you can flick a switch sometimes, and it can automatically appear. Even if rents go up to the point where development becomes much more attractive, that doesn't mean the entitlement situation is going to become any easier and companies like ours are going to be able to deliver product in a timely manner. So the nice thing about having existing space is that it exists so you control exactly what you can do with it. The problem with development is while, yes, you need tenants to pay the appropriate level of rent in order to justify the investment and the return, there's a whole bunch of third parties out there who can control whether that space ever gets built or not and really controls your project, much more so than you do existing space. So that's why I mean I totally agree with Paul. I think the thing we're going to see is we're going to see rents trail up and rents may trail up to the point where developments at some point look attractive. But that still doesn't mean they get done, because of all the other factors that are necessary to actually  put a shovel in the ground.
David Oakes: Cedric, and I'll give you one example by the way of what I'm talking about, and what's happening with the demand in the rents and on the Borders situation. We've got one that's coming back with the latest wave of liquidation, where we've got 2 of the junior anchors we've all been talking about regularly. Fighting for the space is fun. We're seeing a competition like we haven't seen. We're going to achieve somewhere in the 14 to 14.5 range on space that I'm telling you would have leased for $9, 2.5 years ago. And that's part of the story. Now that's a very positive exception to the rule but that's what we're going to see more of.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. And I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please proceed.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, all, very much for joining us, and we look forward  to speaking with you next quarter. Have a nice weekend.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."
14,SITC,3,2011,2011-10-28 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFOs. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. I'd like to begin the call with a brief discussion about the status of DDR corporately. It is important to note that today, regardless of market volatility, DDR has become both financially and operationally a stable and growing company. And while it appears that as though market fluctuations will continue, I assure you that such volatility does not accurately reflect the stability of our capital structure nor the consistency reflected in our operating metrics. Simply put, while the market may be volatile, we are not. Since the trough of the cycle, we have reduced debt by about 30%, extended our debt maturity profile from 3 years to 4.5 years, increased our portfolio leased rate by 270 basis points to 93.4% leased and have sold $2.3 billion of non-prime and non-income-producing assets. And we are not done. When we laid out our plan in 2009 to address the various hurdles we needed to overcome, we vowed to be better prepared for the next capital market's dislocation. While the past several months have certainly highlighted the magnitude and speed at which markets can change direction, as a management team, we are confident in the position of the company to benefit from the opportunities that always arise from market corrections. In that regard and looking forward, we see tremendous opportunities for continued growth, combined with balance sheet and asset quality improvement. With regard to our capital recycling strategy, we continue to see demand for non-prime assets and have also been successful disposing of non-income-producing assets in land held for development. While non-prime asset sales will decelerate due primarily to our progress to date and the size of the remaining bucket, we are confident we will soon achieve our strategic goal of 90% of total NOI being derived from our prime portfolio. Currently, 88.3% of the total NOI comes from prime assets. With non-prime assets under contract for sale and continued disposition of non-income-producing assets, coupled with prime asset acquisitions, achieving 90% is years ahead of schedule. As announced at quarter end, we reinvested $150 million from non-prime dispositions into prime asset acquisitions. In 2011, that will contribute to the continued growth and improvement of our portfolio. In addition to the assets purchased, we are working towards the closing of the previously announced asset swap with our friends at Glimcher in which DDR will sell Leawood Town Center in Kansas City and acquire Polaris Towne Center, a power center in Columbus, Ohio. This transaction highlights our continued focus on simplifying our message and portfolio ownership by taking a creative approach to its sourcing opportunities. And to further simplify our story, during the quarter, we changed our name and launched a new brand identity. While development is still a core competency, it no longer warrants top billing and from an asset-ownership perspective, we aspire to be the premier owner of prime power centers, which renders the word ""diversified"" as completely inaccurate. As a result, we thank you for your embrace of the new name DDR Corp. The market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. I will now turn the call over to Paul to discuss portfolio operations and share his perspective on the retail landscape.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. I'll spend some time today talking about the retail environment, the strong connection between retailer and consumer and what we're hearing from retailers about holiday expectations. While we can all acknowledge that we are shadowed by an unstable macroeconomic backdrop with a future impact that is not fully understood, the supply and demand dynamic is dramatically different than in 2008. Landlords, retailers and consumers alike are better prepared, making calculated decisions and are capable of successfully navigating today's uncertain times. Furthermore, for those retailers able to take advantage of lessons learned in the past recession, today presents a compelling opportunity to gain market share, maintain and grow margins and continue to execute upon steady growth plans. We need not look any further than recent retail sales reports to confirm this trend as productivity and stores continues to outpace the macroeconomic news. At DDR, our commitment to upgrading the quality of our portfolio is translating into results; results in the form of higher average rent per square foot, new deal leasing spreads in the mid-teens and year-over-year net effective rent growth. Despite a smaller portfolio, the combination of our higher-quality shopping centers and persistent retailer demand resulted in more new leases being signed in the third quarter than in any previous quarter in the company's history. Quite simply, demand for quality real estate remains robust. In the third quarter, we signed 220 new leases for 973,000 square feet with a positive spread of 16% and 296 renewals for 1.6 million square feet with a positive spread of 6%. In total, we completed 516 deals for over 2.5 million square feet with a blended spread of 7%. As a result, our domestic leased rate is now 93.1%, a 30-basis point increase over last quarter and 110-basis point increase over the third quarter of 2010. Including Brazil, our leased rate is now 93.4%. This represents our sixth straight quarter of positive leasing spreads and reflects the continued demand we are seeing from retailers. Though we do not expect to see new lease spread levels this high every quarter due to the natural mix of deals, we do expect spreads to remain comfortably positive. It is important to note that this growth will be partially reflected in our income statement in the coming year with full annual impact showing up in 2013. I would like to briefly address Brazil's impact on operating metrics and why it is relevant to our business and important to these disclosures. Brazil represents 8% of our NOI and continues to grow. While others have exposure to emerging markets, it is likely a less significant factor and may not warrant inclusion due to the immaterial nature of the contribution. However, 8% is material and will be disclosed as such. Quite simply, when you invest in DDR, you are investing in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Brazil with Puerto Rico and Brazil accounting for almost 25% of total NOI. Turning back to domestic. With the continued evolution of the supply and demand dynamic we are experiencing in the Power Center business, it begs the question, when will development be a viable growth alternative? While retailers continue to show a willingness to pay more for the right location, they are still unwilling to take lesser space based on reduced rental rates alone. When you couple retail demand with limited new supply, the fact is simple: existing quality space is worth more. However, the increased level of demand does not necessarily translate into a rush for new ground-up development. On a risk-adjusted basis, yields on most new ground-up development projects do not yet make economic sense. So the positive leasing momentum on existing space will continue for the foreseeable future. In contrast, redevelopment continues to serve as a significant growth driver for retailers in need of new stores. As you might have seen in our recent Puerto Rico redevelopment press release, we are investing $50 million in what are some of our most productive assets and project to generate a return of over 10%. Consistent with the U.S., the demand for space on the island is robust with retailers preferring to take newly configured space, in proven quality centers, not risking their growth on untested new developments with the certainty of product and consumer traffic is left to projections and unproven operating results. The sales productivity of the assets we are reinvesting in ranges from $400 to $520 per square foot, which tells a very compelling story to prospective tenants. For the consumer, we've seen no real wage or employment growth since the recession. This has forced the consumer to manage their personal balance sheets and as seen by the continued positive same store sales results and healthy margins achieved by many retailers over the past year. Our tenants have appropriately refined merchandising and sales strategies to match the appetite and spending capability of the consumer. And while sales are one indicator of a retailer's health, the operating margin is what is most important as they pay rent with margin, not with comp store sales. And when it comes to margin, there is nothing more important than inventory level and inventory turns. Inventory level plays a critical role on a retailer's bottom line and no season is more important to the bottom line than the upcoming holiday season. It's important to note that shipping levels at the 5 largest U.S. ports are down 5% to 10% compared to 2010 levels. This shows a positive level of inventory discipline that should translate into controlled markdowns and predictable margins regardless of comp store sales. Lower inventory levels should not be viewed as retailer pessimism regarding holiday sales, but more importantly, as sensible business planning. As you recall, the reason retailers struggled in 2008 was because they had too much inventory and had to sell at deep discounts, dramatically reducing margins. Today, retailers are on a much better position to sell inventory at close to full price as they continue to manage their businesses effectively. Retailers would much rather make arrangements for last minute deliveries, or what it's often referred to as chasing inventory due to higher levels of demand, than to eat away at margins by lowering inventory turnover and selling products at deeply discounted prices. Simply put, retailers are more willing to miss a sale this holiday season than to mark it down. From what I'm also hearing from retailers, the expectations are for holiday sales to be marginally positive. Back-to-school sales are a great indicator of holiday sales, and August and September sales were up roughly 5%. Furthermore, the vast majority of prime retailers, of our prime retailers, have been increasing earnings guidance. Walmart, TJX, PetSmart, Kohl's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ross, Dick Sporting Goods and Kroger are just a handful of our top tenants that have increased earnings guidance in 2011. As evidenced by the progress we've made in the leasing of our former Borders boxes, the retailers' need for quality locations, top line growth and their desire to grow market share will continue to be the driving force behind the demand we continue to see across our portfolio. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. For the third quarter, operating FFO is $67.4 million or $0.24 per share, which is in line with our estimates. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $8.1 million or $0.03 per share. Non-operating items were primarily noncash impairment charges mainly the results of recently accelerated plans to sell developed land in Russia and Canada. Gains of approximately $7 million on asset sales were also recognized during the quarter and are excluded from both FFO and operating FFO. Fourth quarter transactional activity may lead to additional gains and losses, including the Leewood transaction where we expect to record a gain of approximately $60 million related to the swap that Dan described in his remarks. As you notice from our press release, we are tightening our guidance for 2011 operating FFO per share on both ends to $0.95 to $1 per share. While we are very pleased that the pace of investments has accelerated, we have continued to be a net seller of properties in 2011. Despite this and the accelerated refinancings earlier this year, we are pleased to maintain our original guidance midpoint. That speaks volumes about overall portfolio performance and sends many encouraging signs for long term. We are proud to be the leader among retail REITs in recycling capital. Proceeds from asset sales represent an extremely valuable source of capital, and we remain confident that acquisitions and redevelopment projects funded with this equity will create significant future value. For the first 9 months of this year, asset sales generated $166 million of proceeds and we closed on $150 million of prime acquisitions. We also have a pipeline of disposition that could generate nearly $200 million of additional proceeds over the next 2 quarters. While asset sales will decelerate in 2012, primarily due to progress made to date in the reduced remaining non-prime inventory, we are pleased with the portfolio realignment achieved through our Asset Management strategy. In addition to acquisitions, future sales proceeds will fund lower risk redevelopment activity such as the new stores and expansions that we have announced recently with target Walmart and the investments in our portfolio and supply constraint in Puerto Rico. We believe this activity will result in a more valuable NOI stream with better long-term growth prospects. While much of the incremental NOI for redevelopment investments won't come online until 2013 or later, this effort will create net asset value, which is consistent with our long-term objectives. We are also pleased to report progress on our effort to monetize some of our non-income-producing assets. During the coming quarters, we expect to close on the sale of development land in Russia and Canada that will result in sales proceeds of approximately $35 million. In Russia, the Yaroslavl development represents an in-field vertical development, and while a viable project, offers no strategic fit to our portfolio. At this point, the liquidity that can be generated from this proposed sale is more valuable to us than holding out for a higher value that could be recognized over time, which was a basis for estimating fair value when we wrote this investment down in mid-2010. With respect to Canada, we are under contract to exit the only non-retail development site we have in Toronto. We have decided to dispose of our interest in these projects and will invest the capital in projects, where DDR can add greater value. In addition to generating the capital to fund the activity with better risk-adjusted returns, these transactions improve our debt to EBITDA ratios through the elimination [indiscernible] that further lower our risk profile. Over the last few years, you have heard us frequently mention the need to maintain access to all possible pools of capital and the recent volatility in the equity and debt market highlight why this is so important for commercial real estate companies. Our significant efforts over the past few years to lower and balance the leverage profile of DDR just put us in much stronger position today than in the past with much fewer near-term maturities. The market for corporate debt, as CMBS said, is currently uncertain. But we have no need to access either in the near term. Balance sheet lenders continue to bid aggressively on high-quality shopping centers such as ours, and we are very pleased with terms of secured loans that we have closed recently. During the quarter, we closed $162 million of financings with 3 life insurance companies. The new loans have a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%, where used retire debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and resulted in excess proceeds of more than $40 million, while extending our average debt maturity more than 9 years on those loans. We maintain a significant portfolio of high-quality unencumbered assets. So if the spread between the cost of secured debt and unsecured debt remains wide for an extended period of time. We could certainly raise additional mortgage debt to fund our maturities and still maintain more than adequate cushion on our unencumbered asset ratios. Our 2012 consolidated debt maturities consist of $180 million of convertible notes due in March, $220 million of unsecured notes that mature in October and approximately $90 million of mortgage debt. We have nearly $600 million of capacity in our revolving credit facilities, retain a considerable portion of free cash flow, have access to attractively priced secured debt, expect to continue to generate capital through asset sales and numerous other potential options under consideration. So we believe these maturities to be quite manageable. The last item that I want to cover this morning is our common stock dividend. The $0.06 dividend paid earlier this month represents a 50% increase from the second quarter. [indiscernible] an annualized basis, still results in a very low payout ratio of approximately 25% of operating FFO. Today we remain confident in our long-term prospects and would expect to be in a position to recommend additional increases to our Board of Directors in the coming quarters, while still retaining an above average percentage of free cash flow. We believe that the value creation and mixed dividend we have underway, combined with a safe and growing dividend, and improving leverage ratios provide a compelling opportunity for investors with long-term focus. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. In conclusion, I'd like to highlight our continued focus on corporate governance and the evolution of our Board of Directors. On September 19, we announced the addition of Rebecca Maccardini to our Board of Directors. Ms. Maccardini brings to our board unparalleled shopping center operations experience, international marketing expertise, deep industry relationships and additional board diversity in gender and in thought. Ms. Maccardini was the first female ICSC worldwide chairman and has a 35-year tenure in the shopping center industry. The addition of Rebecca marks the fifth new Board member since March of 2009, and highlights our continued focus to enhance board-level engagement, corporate governance and best practices for all board-related activities. Before we turn the call over to questions, as Samir mentioned earlier, as many of you know, we have always tried and attempted to make ourselves easily available for questions within this forum. While we have tried to limit questions to a maximum of 2, we really haven't done a very good job on enforcing that. As a result, and accepting the advice of many on this call, we're going to try to police the process a little better. Each caller will be limited to one question and then placed back into listen-only mode while being answered. If there's a follow up, you are welcome to reenter the queue and we'd be happy to take your question. This should enable all questioners to interact with management in a more efficient and timely manner. Thank you for your understanding and we look forward to giving this a try. With that, operator, we will be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samit Parikh from ISI.
Samit Parikh: My question really is about guidance. I know you guys tightened  guidance for the year, but it still sort of leaves a fairly wide range for the fourth quarter. Could you just discuss sort of the drivers to get -- that could be -- get you maybe to the higher end of that range in the fourth quarter or to the lower end?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. So we're happy that year-to-date, we have been able to keep same guidance midpoint throughout the year. We've tightened that consistently throughout the year and so don't want you to think that there's any sort of unforeseen variability in the results. That said, as we continue to make sure that our numbers are as credible as possible, wanted to make sure that we do have a range in there and as we think about it with not much of the year left, but still a few factors that could move around. You've got exchange rates in Brazil that have been more volatile than we've seen in recent times. You've got a LIBOR rate that's been very consistent recently, but it's only a couple of years ago that we saw the dramatic spike in LIBOR in the fourth quarter. In terms of operating results, I don't think we see much that can change percentage rents, and seasonal, we've seen, are pretty well known and a very, very small part of results. So I don't think we view there to be much variability at all in the operating results. But do acknowledge there are few things on the financial side that could push the numbers $0.01 or $0.02 in either direction. And so we just want to make sure that we've got a range that contemplates that and creates an extremely low-risk profile that we end up outside of that range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy: David, just with regard to the converts and bonds that mature next year, what are your other options for more permanent refinancing if the bond market remain status quo? And can you also address the term loan in the credit facilities in the Crest JV, where are you in talks on refinancing those and would both partners potentially have to pay down some of the equity?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: For the consolidated debt maturities, the $180 million of converts, 220-and-change-million of unsecured notes. We are seeing just in the past week or 2 weeks an improvement in the bond market. I think our base case is that we'll be able to access the unsecured market at some point over the next 6 to 12 months to access long-term unsecured debt the way we did earlier this year at 475 rate for 7-year paper. We would hope that some of the volatility we've seen just in the past couple  months abates at some point during that multi-quarter window that we have to be able to raise unsecured notes during that time to replace the existing unsecured maturities. That said, we're certainly not counting on that and so we do have other plans in place. We've got a significant unencumbered asset pool. We've been through this before where the unsecured markets were closed in a much more troubling time with much more near-term maturities. And we were able to raise considerable secured debt and attractive price in that environment, and I think we believe that would be the case again today. So to the extent that the unsecured market isn't there for us at acceptable pricing, there's considerable access and we've shown it on a consistent quarterly basis to the secured market where we believe we could raise at least that $400 million at a price somewhere depending on where rates are in a given day, somewhere in the 4% -- in the 4% to 5% range for 10-year paper. So I think we believe that's a very strong backup plan that we're advancing today, but would expect to see some rationalization in the unsecured market that would allow us to do a deal there. In addition, we mentioned the asset sale proceeds, the considerable free cash flow, as some of the other means that we do have to address those maturities. And thinking about the joint venture maturities, the great majority of those are in our DDR TC venture, which is the venture of with TIA-CREF, extremely large sophisticated well-capitalized partner, we're in discussions with the lender on the 5-year note that matures in 2012. We're also in discussions with a consortium of banks that comprise the line of credit for that venture that represents the large majority of the maturities. For next year and between us and TIAA-CREF  Resources, we would feel confident that we get that done, that we get that refinanced and extended as we look out over the next several quarters, but active negotiations today, and so don't want your say too much there.  But we are well positioned to deal with those, based on the quality underlying assets, and like I said, a quality and well capitalized partner where if we did fund some capital, and we'd capable of doing that, talking to lenders today about what exactly the outcome is going to be there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: Given your success in Brazil, I'm just wondering if you're considering any expansion into other areas of South America.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We are not. We feel that given the current conditions in Brazil and the current opportunities in Brazil, that is where we should direct our attention to make sure that we're maximizing the value that we've already harvested in Brazil. There are other opportunities that do come our way from time to time. But we want to be very, very focused on really 3 factors of our business, Craig. It's Puerto Rico, it's domestic U.S. and it's Brazil. And we think  that, that's a prudent way to approach the business. And we'll continue in that manner. Doesn't mean we don't look at things, but very rarely do things get to a level where we give it serious consideration.
David John Oakes: Yes. And you're not going to see this company misinterpret, again, the success of a great investment and platform that we helped build in Brazil with the notion that it goes to our ego and said that need to be a massive South American consolidator. So I think we feel great about what we have today but would really struggle to see how we add anywhere close to as much value entering a new market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.
Ki Bin Kim: It looks like you guys made some progress in leasing of the small shop space. Can you just a little bit more about that and what kind of tenants are moving in?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. Quite frankly, it's still a struggle in that category. And as you might have seen in the supplement and in fact, the only, the smallest category of space we have between 0 and 2,500 was our only size category with a slight decline. And one thing that's important to know is that it's not a significant number that moves the needle a little each way and some of that was actually planned from some redevelopment operations. But what we are seeing on the positive side continues to be improvement in the franchise area. UPS is one that comes to mind that we're working very closely with and achieving great success with those guys as they get back in the game. The food categories are some of the more active tenants in that space. And I think one of the things we all need to focus on is that we continue, whether it's through asset sales or redevelopment or just general lease-up. We will continue to improve that and I don't want anybody looking at that small negative in the third quarter of '11 is any kind of trend because it won't be. We're still confident we'll get that smallest category up with the rest of the portfolio somewhere in the mid-80s, high 80s as we continue to lease up the portfolio and get closer to a full occupancy situation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: When you started your discussion today, you talked about the stability of the company and the balance sheet and all the kind of tumultuous financial markets. I think about that, the fewer number of moving pieces that you have in '12 with you kind of running through the non-core, non-prime asset sales, why not think about just recalibrating the dividend. I mean it's still at a very low payout ratio. And I know it's growing and it has room to grow. But have you considered, what are the reasons why you might not just consider more of a step up to get to a yield closer to the peers?.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. That's a great question. It's something we talk about on a regular basis both as a management team and with our board. One of the things that we wanted to make sure as we look at enterprise risk management and the status of the company and the status of the market is that when we do go to that level, we want to make sure that we are as stable as we can be and that we are operating in a market that has some forward visibility, which has not been the case for quite some time and most importantly as we mentioned in prior calls, we want to make sure that we were in a position where all of our debt maturities were very manageable. And we think we are at that point. We had a significant raise from a percentage standpoint in the dividend recently. And as David mentioned in the script, it's something that we will have a conversation with our board about in the very near future because we do think that 2012 presents an opportunity for us to have additional increases as we look at the overall portfolio, the operations and we realize quite frankly that this is as stable as DDR has been in recent memory, for sure. So we hear you, we agree. It is absolutely our goal to get our dividend in line with our industry peers, and we will work towards that and it is a constant source of conversation but most importantly it is clearly a sign of our comfort level and the stability of the company. And from a management team, we are there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Dan, just want to go to your sort of similar, your initial comments talking about the health of the company. If you look over the past few months when the world started to melt apart again in August, September, CBS[ph] gapped out. You guys went from being under the REIT average for CBS[ph] to being well outside. Thankfully, everything's retightening. But just sort of curious, were your comments driven because you were seeing an impact from a corporate or liquidity standpoint from the CBS[ph] gap out? Or were your comments totally separate from the CBS[ph] gap out and sort of just trying to understand how your bondholders, your lenders look at CBS[ph] that we see on Bloomberg versus your internal financials.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Sure. It really had no impact on us and my comments are really outside of that. My comments are really -- there are certainly times in the last several months where it looked like, that people were playing the 2008 card all over again. And while frustrating to see that when it completely ignores the progress that we've made to date, we recognize the fact it will take some time for the market to truly understand the progress that we've made. But I thought it was important at least to say that while there is volatility in the market and while we still trade as a high-data[ph] name and we do still have a higher leverage than our peer group average and we recognize that. The strategy is the same, the success rate will be the same. Our focus is absolutely directed towards all the strategic objectives that we have outlined to you in the past. And that while some folks might want to play a 2008 card, this is not a 2008 company. And that's really what I was trying to indicate, was that we are not particularly volatile. If you look at our operating performance, if you look at our guidance and what we're coming in with our guidance, there's certain level of consistency and predictability with us that would certainly indicate anything but volatility. But that being said, we recognize that we have a history and we recognize the fact that we do live in a bigger world then just the one in which we currently trade and there were impacts on the company as a result. And we're sensitive to that. But we just wanted people to be certainly reassured and reminded that we are not the same company today than we were in 2008, and we are completely committed to our strategy to continue to improve the financial metrics of this company in a way that we've outlined.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Dan, can you talk about what you're hearing from retailers about net square footage growth over the next 2 to 3 years? And just maybe if I could squeak in a second part, just remind us when the lion's share of the gap between your percentage leased and commenced is realized for you guys?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, I'll share the answer with Paul. But I think that question is interesting and very, very timely, Jeff, because there is a lot of speculation in the market and a lot of chatter about what about downsizing and things of that nature and what you're hearing from the retailers in that regard. I think a little perspective in this sort of sea of speculation is probably in order. One of the things that we don't have to do is we don't have to guess. We have access to the retailers that are talking about downsizing. We have met with them, Paul and his team are with them on a regular basis. So taking a look at some of the facts that we have and what we're hearing is actually pretty interesting and it goes to the total immaterial nature of what the potential downsizing for a company like ours could be. If you look at the store like Best Buy, which has talked about downsizing and you look at the office supply stores, et cetera, et cetera. As we talk to those guys, in the best case scenario where they had either some leverage or a very, very strong desire over very extended period of time, we might see something in the neighborhood of 350,000 square feet of space that gets returned to our portfolio. And to put that in perspective, it's going to end up being less than 3% of our annual volume of leasing. And probably just from a reference standpoint, the space that we're talking about on the reduction side represents about 9% of the bank of space we got back over the last few years, which is already leased or sold in the high 90% range. So you're talking about an opportunity that -- and by the way, in many cases we would like that opportunity to be better, because we like the concept of marking to market space in 95-plus  percent lease prime assets. So if we can mark space to market, we can make a lot more money. But we're really not going to get a lot of that back. And I think this is going to be one of those situations where there's much more chatter in the market about it, much more guessing, much more speculation, and actually much less execution than what people are concerned about and what they're talking about. The best way, though, that we're dealing with this, Jeff, is to not guess. People like to make statements like we are concerned about precipitous downsizing in the sector. That's a pure guess. So what we're doing is we're spending a lot of time with the retailers, we're quantifying the number. And as a result, we're looking at what the potential impact could be, both positively and negatively. And the truth is, it's immaterial. And I think if that changes, obviously, we'll let you know. But we are not in the business guessing of guessing what the future impact is going to be. We are at a point now where the conversations are deep enough and long enough that we know what to expect. And one thing we know we can do at this company is lease space. So again as a percentage to a total of what we do, it's not going to be a major factor for DDR. Paul?
Paul W. Freddo: Jeff, I want to add a few comments to Dan's, but let me first answer your second question. The spread between the leased rate and the lease commenced or rent paying rate is 260 basis points as of the end of the third quarter, which is 10 basis points higher than we ended the second quarter. Important to note that, by the way, it's good news because it comes with a lot of lease-up. Obviously it helps drive that spread. But we have a significant number in that pool of signed but not rent-commenced  opening in the fourth quarter of 2011. So we will see a drop by year end, but again that's because of the significant number of leased tenants that are opening in the fourth quarter, any time after October 1. Just a quick follow up to Dan, it is about the communication and the sitting with the retailers, the face-to-face discussions that we have regularly. And as Dan put it, not guessing but knowing exactly where they're coming from, how we can work together, I think -- Old Navy is a great example of a company that we've worked well with to execute on a few downsizes and bring in tenants like Carter's and Justice and Alta. It's been a good story because we communicate regularly with them. I would like to make one other point, speaking of The Gap. The recent news coming out of Gap Inc. was certainly not news to us. And the fact is, just so there is no misunderstanding of our exposure, of to 40 plus Gap Inc. units we have, there are only 4 gap units. And in fact, 3 of those have recently been renewed through their exercise of options. So most of our exposure obviously is with Old Navy, we're working closely, our average size with Old Navy is 18,000 and we don't have a lot of risk there either.
Operator: Your next question as a follow-up from the line of Ki Bin Kim.
Ki Bin Kim: If you could help out with developments, you have a lot of assets on hold. Any thoughts on that and how much further do rents have to climb to justify the economics on those deals?
Paul W. Freddo: We continue to work them, which is one thing that should be understood meaning we continue to discuss the opportunities regularly with the retail community we deal with regularly. It's hard to put a number on exactly where it needs to get because other things impact the return, obviously, such as the cost of the construction, et cetera, and what those prices 'may do'. But the fact is that it's not there today, and we absolutely see no reason to rush into it and we're not seeing it from our competitors quite frankly. So it's not there. There are some sites that someday will probably be developed but again that's just a matter of continuing to talk to the retailers. The art of negotiation is one obviously where we're continuing to talk them up and remind them that there's a limited supply out there. But again no rush to jump into it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley: I'm here with Michael Bilerman as well. Dan I think in your opening remarks you commented on some of the tremendous opportunities for external growth that you're seeing as a function of some of the dislocation in credit markets recently. Just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what you're seeing and whether or not that's just one-off  prime asset acquisitions or whether there's some bigger opportunity you're seeing?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We look at the opportunities in sort of 2 buckets. Yes to the prime asset acquisitions. In fact, one of the prime assets that we acquired was a situation where there were 2 assets on the market. We were not interested in one, we were interested in the other. We were unable to come to terms on a single asset purchase, someone else put their 2 assets under contract, which would not have been acceptable to us because one was clearly non-prime. And because of the market dislocation, the entity that put the 2 assets under contract were unable to close and so it came back to us. And said are you still interested in the one, we were interested in the one at a slightly different price. And we ended up having an outstanding execution in the acquisition of a prime asset. That never would have happened if we didn't hit situation where CMBS went south and overall market sentiment was poor. So that's one area, for sure. The other area's actually in what we call a development partnerships group and our development partnerships are a group of individuals within all[ph] organizations that are meeting with a lot of private developers who continue to struggle -- even when things were good, as you all know, for the public companies, the capital availability for the private companies was still strained. And there are viable projects out there that have a very low risk profile in the sense that the land is already owned by someone else. It's entitled and there's significant tenant interest, but there are capital needs. So that is an area where we can bring our platform to help with leasing. We certainly bring our construction and our site-planning  expertise to help with the layout, without having to take local entitlement risk and land banking risk, which we will much prefer to go to a local sharpshooter than to us. So that is something that is presenting itself as a result of still significant capital dislocation in the private development world. And third, we talk about all the time and it shouldn't be overlooked. The redevelopment bucket will continue to grow. Tenant demand is so far outstripping supply and tenant flexibility, which is something that is, tenant and flexibility are two words that have been mutually exclusive for many years. So tenant flexibility is continuing to increase, and that's creating opportunity at existing assets. So as Paul said, existing space is going to be worth more. And we're seeing that come through on a regular basis. Assets that have an operating history, have the appropriate co-tenancy, are in prime markets and have availability are very valuable today. And because of the size and scope of our portfolio, we're seeing redevelopment  opportunities continue to grow. So we think between redevelopment, some potential maybe new development and joint venture with local sharpshooters. And prime acquisitions with less competition from the private sector we're seeing quite a bit of opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: I guess for Paul or for Dan, you mentioned obviously the very strong third quarter and then the pickup you expect into the fourth quarter if tenants open. Can you give us just some sort of update on the potential for 2012 in terms of the NOI pickup, in terms of leasing achieved thus far and what you expect to hit, I guess the bottom line for next year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: No J. we're really -- we're not in a position to give that direction. We've been pretty disciplined in how we give guidance over the last couple of years. And one of the reasons why we've been much more accurate in our guidance delivery is we'll do it in a disciplined manner. We will provide guidance in January. The NOI number  will be very clearly spelled out as it has been in the past. And we'll hold off until that point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: On the redevelopment and development fronts, is $750 million, I think that's the number you threw out last quarter, is that the number that you still expect over the next several years for the scope of the redevelopment program? And then if that flows into development, is the stuff on Page 32, is that land that you have there, is that where you might actually do a development or should we think of those as sort of defunct at this point?
Paul W. Freddo: On the redevelopment piece, Rich, that is still our number. We have a spend issue[ph] somewhere in the mid-50s and, keep in mind that space will come online at all different times over the next year and a half. I mean some of these redevelopment projects are expensive projects. But we're going to continue to grow that pace of spend. We've got a pretty good program for 2012 laid out, and beyond. We continue to look at additional opportunities. But right now, that 750 is still something we're sticking with.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And, Rich, in regard to the roster on Page 32 of the supplement, some of those are projects that we continue to work, where we -- and will get built over time if we feel that we can get an appropriate return on incremental capital to warrant the development of those properties or those locations. Our goal obviously is to monetize all of that and we'll either monetize it through actually building it with appropriate returns or through the sale of some of these assets and some of the land here because there will be interest from others in markets where we had an interest in developing and we no longer do.
Paul W. Freddo: [indiscernible] will be our hybrid where you see development going on in some of that land. But it's a capital inflow for DDR revenue and outflow if demand from the major anchors remain extremely strong and the opportunity for us to sell parcels to those guys may result in something being built on that land but not in a capital-intensive way for DDR.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: One of the things that we just have to keep in mind when we look at that list of land is that the world has changed. And the world has changed since we entitled the law of that land, the world has changed since we bought it, for sure. And the world continues to change and that's why it's so important to stay in front of tenants because if you look at some of those properties and some of those markets, the tenants that we were proceeding in those markets were either are no longer interested or already there, or some of them don't even exist. But the flip side is also true, there are a whole new cadre of tenants that are interested because they have a desire for market expansion, they have new prototypes and they need growth. They need external growth. So again as Paul said, we're still far below on the development side where rents need to be in order to start any kind of development pipeline to get an appropriate return on a risk-adjusted basis. But that being said, some of these actually will get built and they will be monetized through the construction of retailers on this land and some of them will just have to [indiscernible].
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: David, you talked about the non-prime dispositions I believe being less in 2012 than what we saw in 2011. Can you just talk about how big of a pull is left that you would like to sell over time? Are you still going to have some sales over the next few years or does 2012 knock out the bulk of what's left?
David John Oakes: I think we believe it's an important consistent discipline that in a portfolio of this size, there should always be something that we think appropriate to sell, based on the expected total return of prospects over the next several years. The NOI growth or more likely for these assets decline prospects over the next couple of years. So I think we expect to stay active in the disposition business. It's just going from a non-prime portfolio that exceeded $1.5 billion a few years ago, just 2 years ago. And today being in the $600 million, $700 million range where it's barely 10% of our NOI. We have reduced it significantly, sometimes you got debt issues that make sales harder, sometimes you've got partner issues that immediately encourage a sale. And so we made more progress than anyone else in disposing, in total, close to $2.5 billion of non-prime assets when you look over the past 4 years. And so I think we believe it to be a  continued important discipline, just don't think that the multi-hundred million dollars pace for the past few years is achievable, or justify going forward if there's just a lot less of that product on our books to sell. And so we'll continue to be active portfolio managers, eliminating assets where we think the IRRs are the worst over the next several years, based on our views and based on feedback from tenants. But just wouldn't expect to see the volume that you've seen over the past couple of years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: You did a good job talking about your 2012 maturities and how you're going to be able to handle them. But one thing that I don't think you've been talking about much lately is whether or not you should add equity to the balance sheet. What's your appetite at this point to add equity?
David John Oakes: Our view and the strategic long-term plan we've tried to articulate is that we do have balance sheet metrics that include improvement in our credit ratios, improvement in our credit ratings that we want to and expect to execute upon over the next several years. But at this point, we do not at all believe that new common equity is required to achieve those metrics based on the monetization nonproducing assets based on the retention of free cash flow, based on the continued growth in EBITDA that we've seen and expect to continue to see in a significant way going forward. And so I think we have a very firm focus on continued improvement in our leverage profile, both duration as well as total amount, improvement in our credit ratios, but we don't believe additional common equity needs to be a part of those plans to do that immediately.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Just along those same lines. You just talk a bit about, when you do talk to the credit rating agencies right now and kind of their requirements and their benchmarks to you, I don't offer[ph] you guys to get any additional credit rating upgrade and kind of where you are relative to those benchmarks and how quickly you think you might be able to get to those benchmarks?
David John Oakes: Sure. We actually met with the 3 agencies just a couple of weeks ago. We characterize it as very good meetings across the board. I think the tone from a macro standpoint is no one's looking to upgrade anything right now. It's just given this level of uncertainty in the world, given the volume of time that the agencies are spending on either securitized debt or probably even more importantly sovereign debt, mid-cap corporates are not on the top of the list of any sort of meaningful ratings change certainly not on the upgrade side just given the uncertainty in the world. That said, I think they're very pleased with our progress. We've been very open with them. We've had a great dialogue with them over the past couple of years where we've outlined what we were going to do. And then we've done it, so I think it's not just the improvements in the metrics, it's the credibility that we've earned back that's been important to them. And so I can't see that we see any immediate signs of upgrades. We have seen considerable upgrade activity either in outlook or rating over the past several quarters and we'd expect that to continue as we look out over the next year or so. But hard to point to anything immediate. We are the only REIT, I believe, that Fitch has a positive outlook on. And so encouraged there for what could be the next catalyst on that side and focus on our continued very strong positive dialogue with them. I think the metric that we and they have probably ended talking about and focusing on the most is fixed charge coverage. We have improved that ratio through numerous transactions including the common equity for preferred redemption that we did earlier this year. We've improved that ratio from just below 1.7x to 1.8x today. And I think as we show more and more credibility over the next several quarters, to a year and change of getting that back to 2x, I think that would be one important specific metric that we're very focused on, and I think they're very focused on. And it doesn't have to necessarily already be there but I think as we both -- as we continue to show them the clear bright[ph] path for how we get to that point and they've get credibility in our ability to execute, that becomes an important catalyst.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Odell with AIG Asset Management.
Michael Odell: I was just hoping if you could provide us with 2012 in terms of the JV debt in 2012, what's the recourse to DDR?
David John Oakes: Almost extremely little of that debt would be recoursed to DDR. The debt we talked about earlier in the joint ventures was in the DDR T/C Venture where that is not going to be recoursed to DDR. As we look at the other 12 maturities, it's extremely uncommon for us to provide recourse on any joint venture debt. So the only place historically or currently that you're going to find it is on the development asset that were developed through joint ventures. And so it would be a small amount of the debt particularly in the Coventry joint venture we're there were some development projects that would probably be the only 2012 maturity. We would have[ph] recourse, we can go through that, the entire list, and get yourself in a little more specific after the call. But it's extremely uncommon for us to offer recourse in any situation. So it would really just be on the new development assets and joint ventures, there may be some DDR recourse.
Operator: Next question is a follow up from the line of Samit Parikh with ISI.
Samit Parikh: Just a follow up for Dan and Paul. Paul, you talked about sort of a compelling opportunity for certain retailers to gain market share at this point. Just want to ask you in terms of expansions for these specific retailers, sort of what are you hearing on that? Are they scaling back at all for 2012? And if they're not, what type of -- where are they targeting and maybe specifically to sort of the type of demographics that they're targeting?
Paul W. Freddo: Okay. We're seeing very few scale back. There are a couple of exceptions, none of them were significant to us. Lowe's just recently announced that they were going to pretty much cut their new store opening plan and quite frankly, we were working with nothing on them, with them, anyway. Staples and Best Buy would be the other 2 examples that quickly come to mind that people slow down their growth and for obvious reasons. That said, we're seeing as aggressive an approach by the key retailers we deal with all the time, as we have in the past couple of years even more so as they're competing for the same space. Redevelopments, expansions of centers. That's what they need to focus on. We've talked quite a bit about the lack of new supply and they get that. So they are looking at how they fit into an existing site, how we might reconfigure, if you will. But they are also looking at some different demographics. It's not across the board. Some are going to stick very closely to what they need in terms of density and household incomes. But we are seeing quite a few that are -- have looked at a smaller prototype. I think the pet stores are a great example. The arts and crafts guys, they're looking much smaller than they used to, and that gives them the ability to hit smaller markets, smaller population densities. Income levels, they're still looking pretty much the same thing they always have. PETCO is a classic example. They went down to a 12,000 prototype and now have something, they call unleashed, which is down to 6,000 feet, which is more of a very convenience-oriented look at some more metro areas. But it's a focus on how they redevelop existing properties and where they might be able to improve their market share through discovering new markets through smaller stores.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: One of the things that we should all keep in mind is that a lot of these retailers are probably companies too, and they have awful lot of spend on some of things that they sell. And I think it's important that someone asked the question periodically when retailers announced that they're going to scale back, there's a couple of reasons for that, usually the reason for that is because they missed they're open to buy because availability is low. So what a number of retailers are hearing is that the markets would like them to scale back and be a little more conservative perhaps on growth. So they're giving you something that they never had. So the question that we often ask retailers when they say we're going to reduce from 40 stores to say 30 stores, the question is how many of those 10 stores were you really committed to and the answer is typically none. Because there is often a disconnect between the expectations articulated to the market and the execution of the real estate department for individual retailers and we bumped into that many, many times. So expectations scaling back are usually not a function of business model. It's usually the function of the availability of space to meet the strategic growth needs, and instead of basically going back to the markets and saying oops, we overpromised and are under delivering, they're going back and saying well we're going to be conservative and deliver fewer stores. But the stores were never there to begin with. And I think that's sort of the question we always ask. And in some cases, there is a good business reason why retailers will pull back in their store count. But in most cases, it's because the space is simply not available, and that is particularly the case in this environment where nothing new is being built.
Operator: Your next question is a follow up from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Just thinking about your run rate as it relates to Q4, what are you guys seeing from pop-up tenant demand this holiday season? Many retailers experimented with it last year. I was curious if you see a greater impact this coming quarter than maybe last year.
Paul W. Freddo: Jeff, it's pretty much right in line with last year. The  one that's been well publicized, Toys ""R"" Us -- has cut back a little bit on their temporary space. But we're seeing the same success rate we have in the past. And even with less vacant space to deal with, our number's right in line with where it was last year. And one thing that brings to mind is that with the Borders, which we talked about in a recent press release, one of the things that I think sometimes gets lost is we achieved almost $300,000 in temporary income just to Halloween stores in several of those locations. So the appetite is still there. Again I think the one exception Toys ""R"" Us has come out recently and talked about just fewer locations for their temp space this holiday.
Operator: Your next follow-up question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. Dan and Paul, I'd appreciate your comments regarding the sort of downsizing, retailers downsizing, and not wanting to guess. I guess there does run a pretty wide gamut I'm sure of all the experiences that you've had and discussions that you have, and I was wondering if you can sort of share some examples of what's happened. And when I think about it, you've probably had stores that wanted to be resized and you've been able to release that, the excess space of the retailers. You've had retailers that wanted to resize but you haven't been able to release that space where you've had to, it hasn't been part of the shopping center and you've basically had to take it away or leave it vacant. I assume that there's some tenants that are just using -- they're not using all their floor space. And they'll wait to the roll and they'll either try and negotiate lower rent or they'll resize at that point. I assume that there's some vacant but renting tenants in the portfolio, and I assume there's also cases where you don't own the box and what those retailers are doing if they have a desire to downsize and whether they're trying to release out there is space or carve out their space as well. So I was just wondering if you can sort of delve down deeper into the specific examples of what you've been hearing things so that we can get a better grasp on what's happening.
Paul W. Freddo: As Dan mentioned earlier, Michael, the key is being with the tenants that we all can identify who might be more prone to downsizing. Maybe examples I gave earlier were some of our better ones, where with Carter's and Alta and Five Below and Justice. We haven't executed on a downsize with any tenant where we don't have an answer for residual space. And I'll also point out that we haven't lost a tenant because we haven't been able to downsize them. That just hasn't been the case. That said, we're not kidding ourselves and we know which ones we need to work with and work with closely. But they have obligations also. I'm not quite sure, I'm sure there's some examples where tenants have simply moth-balled  some space in the back room, if you will, to downsize their selling area but that hasn't been an issue with us getting space back or even retenanting it. One of the things, Dan mentioned an acquisition earlier and Best Buy is in that center. And we quite frankly, look at the oversized Best Buy as an opportunity. Talked with Best Buy before we close on the transaction and we're working hard with them to do backfill [ph] the space which there's a lot of demand for. And then it just gets to the negotiation on the economics and we're finding that the retailers who are serious about downsizing or [ph] maybe was one of them, Best Buy is probably next in the category, will invest in that downsizing. They're not looking for this to be all on the developer's nickel. And so it's pretty much a cooperative effort. I'll give you one other example where with Best Buy if they're giving back 8,000 feet and we can really only utilize 4,000 because of the configuration, where we're working hard to see that we can convert that space which will be moth-balled into out-parcel  opportunity. And that's a great example of what we'll be doing in a lot of these locations. So I don't want to overemphasize it, Michael, but we do see it as an opportunity with not a lot of risk.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think the other thing that's important is while we do see it as an opportunity with not a lot of risk. But unfortunately the opportunity, on the positive side or the negative side, is not going to move the needle all that much. Because while we are very aggressively working with some folks about mothballing some  space and like Paul just mentioned, during out-parcels,  they're resisting that. They're resisting that because they feel that there may be a time in the future when they want to go back into the space. So this is a very fluid situation. Many of these tenants that we're talking about who have interest in downsizing have had a multiple formats over the last several years. So we don't really know. Are they  50,000-foot tenant, are they a  35,000-square foot tenant, are they had 20,000. Old Navy was at 11,000 they went to 15,000 they went to 25,000, they came back down to 18,000. I mean some of these guys have sort of been all over the place. And one of the things retailers hate to do, particularly merchants, is give up flexibility. They like the flexibility of the box. Now there are clearly some retailers that should be smaller and we'll work with them in that regard. But our caution on this and when we talk about materiality of it is not to jump to geological[ph] extremes, either on the positive or the negative side of it. Because retail is such a fluid business and it changes so quickly, particularly in this market. We are all seeing different prototypes, different strategies, on a regular basis and what we hear today may not be the case tomorrow. So we have to stay in front of retailers, we're spending a lot more time doing that than we've ever done in the history of this company to stay up to speed. But we have to just keep sort of a balance on what this is going to be. It's not going to be a material negative and it's certainly not going to be a material positive either. Even though if you look at, for example, Best Buy, every Best Buy store we have is in a prime asset. Our prime assets run around 95% leased and I think we all know that best Buy is not the greatest rent payer. If we can get that space back, it will be a nice positive growth story. I just think the success rate of getting some of that space back is going to be pretty rough. So when we do our own sort of internal calculation, if there's 50% of the Best Buy stores would like to give back space, we'd probably only get 50% of that 50% and when we start to look at the numbers, it doesn't really move the needle very much and it doesn't become a material factor in how we run the business. We are much more focused on merchandising strategy and we're much more interested in  what some of these retailers who were talking about downsizing are going to do from a merchandising perspective to warrant future deals. Because again it's our job to guess about nothing. We need to know who's going to be the winner and who's going to be the loser in a particular category. And if someone's evolving and is on the downside of that bell-shaped curve, we need to see what they're going to do to pick it back up and that's what we're spending a lot of time doing. Size of the space becomes a bit of background noise in the overall conversation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum: It's Ross Nussbaum here with Christy. A couple of questions, I might have missed this. What was the going-in yield on the third quarter acquisitions and on Polaris, that's part 1. And then part 2 is, if I start thinking about your acquisitions from a price per square foot perspective, it looks like the couple you did in the third quarter were a little over 150 a foot, Polaris was 110 a foot. But then I start thinking about your portfolio being frankly much better geographically than what those deals were. So to me that would imply that the rest of your portfolio would garner a higher per square foot valuation. Can you help me with all this?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Sure. All in everything that we've acquired this year has been in the low to mid 7% cap rate range on a going-in initial return basis. And the third quarter deals represent a majority of that so it's certainly consistent with that. We've looked at opportunities much lower than that but all in we've ended up around that 7, 7.25 sort of overall range with a few outliers a little lower, a few outliers a little higher. But we think that's a good starting point relative to our cost of capital if there is an appropriate growth story to go along with them and we certainly believe that's the case here. On the price per square foot comment, would generally agree with you on a price per pound, do think this portfolio would be valued more highly than what's implicit in the stock price today. And you can see that from the transactional activity. But we have committed as well the other high-quality shopping center companies where acquisitions and generally been higher in price per square foot to reflect what good assets are really trading for. But you always have some exceptions where you just have a low in long-term historic rent that's going to drive that a little lower. But in general, I think your comment and your perception is the right one.
Operator: Your next question as a follow up from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Just want to go back to the Teachers loan, just to make sure I'm not missing something. I'm assuming the 555, that's mortgage, meaning traditional mortgage, not CMBS. And then assuming that it is traditional mortgage, it seems like that market has held up with the, obviously the corporate market's had some gapping out recently and given that this does mature in March of '12, I would think that the life companies would have full annual allocations at that point whereas right now they may be running out of allocations. So what would be -- what's the risk of the refinancing, is it asset quality or is it just generic market risk?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: You're generally right and I would generally characterize it as just the overall market risk, for a loan that is reasonable in size. It's a cross collateralized pool so it's just a more complicated than a simple one-off mortgage. You're exactly right, it's not a CMBS deal. This is financing we did with one insurance company that we have a very good relationship with. And we're in the process of talking to them about what exactly the right refinancing, restructure, next steps could be, either with them or with a new deal in the market in a different fashion. So we completely agree with your comment that the mortgage business when dealing with balance sheet lenders, insurance companies and commercial banks, continues to be extremely strong. We've seen a few that it may be commented that you referenced in terms of being out of, or close to out of allocations for the year. But honestly, we haven't seen many people say that they're out of business and need to wait for 12, but do agree with your notion that the nature of that business is people getting new allocations on Jan 1 and being more active in that first couple of quarters for the year. And we think that's an encouraging sign on top of the market that's already pretty strong and pretty attractively priced, just a negotiation that we have to work through on these specific deals.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
15,SITC,4,2011,2012-02-17 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ann, and I will be your coordinator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like turn the presentation over to Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in our company. The fourth quarter of 2011 was another excellent quarter for DDR, but that really should come as no surprise at this point. 2011 and 2010 overall were excellent years for our company as we continue to execute on our articulated strategy designed to enhance all aspects of our business model. We continue to be very consistent performer in very inconsistent times. And we look ahead to 2012, that consistent performance will continue. Fourth quarter 2011 marks 7 consecutive quarters of same-store NOI growth, 7 consecutive quarters of positive leasing spreads, 10 consecutive quarters of leased rate gains, 12 consecutive quarters of balance sheet improvement and 16 consecutive quarters of non-prime asset sales. In addition, the trend for small shop space over the past 2 years has been positive, with a net gain of 1% in 2010, but growing to 29% in 2011 due to move-ins outpacing move-outs. And with regard to tenant accounts receivable and bad debt expense, we have seen continued meaningful reductions over the past 3 years. We are now in the enviable position of having historically low debt maturities and historically high liquidity, with a staggered and balanced maturity profile. We continue to experience historically high leasing velocity with a historically limited tenant watch list. The credit quality of cash flow continues to improve across our portfolio specifically and our sector generally, as described in detail on Page 35 of our updated investor presentation that you can find on our website. From a balance sheet perspective, we have obvious rating agency momentum and extended debt maturity profile and a significant debt to EBITDA decline to 7.26x on a consolidated basis and 7.74x on a pro rata basis. The bottom line when looking at the DDR story today is that we are still a bit of a contradiction. While our stock continues to trade as a high beta name, our operational performance and balance sheet are increasingly devoid of risk, and we are confident that our operations will continue to improve and our balance sheet will continue to de-risk moving forward. All the above being said, we are under no illusions regarding the environment in which we operate. We all currently live in an economy impacted by quantitative easing, which artificially and temporarily provides the opportunity for businesses to correct deals of the past, improve the present and prepare for the future. As we continue our quest to further de-risk our balance sheet, we do so in acknowledgment of the fact that quantitative easing is not a policy that will last forever and financial opportunities will undoubtedly be more expensive in the future. As a result, we have pursued opportunistic refinancings, and in many cases have accelerated our plans in order to take advantage of current pricing rather than letting the market take advantage of us. Our goal is to keep it real, acknowledge the unique capital opportunity that currently exists and prepare ourselves for the future with balance and capacity. We have raised approximately $8 billion over the past 3 years, completely recapitalized our company and have taken advantage of the opportunity to dramatically improve our balance sheet, enhance our portfolio and grow our business. The current recovery is fragile at best, and absent a subsidized economy, growth is tepid. We understand that long-term investors are not fooled by short-term financial engineering, artificially inflated FFO growth or chronic spread investing at the expense of NAV. We also recognize that savvy investors know the difference between real growth and CapEx-induced growth. We absolutely believe that those who fail to seize the moment to enhance their portfolio quality and financial standing will present future opportunities for those of us currently pursuing a contrary strategy. Financial stability and a realistic view of today will lead to additional opportunity tomorrow. I'll now turn the call over to Paul to discuss portfolio operations.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. The strong level of activity in 2011, which Dan referenced, resulted in a year of significant improvement across our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we executed 239 new leases for 1.1 million square feet and 304 renewals for 1.8 million square feet. Spreads on new leases and owned assets were 9.6% and renewals were 4.5%, resulting in an overall blended spread of 5.8%. For the full year, we executed 876 new leases for 4 million square feet and 1,232 renewals for 7.7 million square feet. Spreads on new leases on owned assets were 11.2% and renewals were 5%, resulting in an overall blended spread of 6.1%. As a result of this activity, our domestic leased rate as of December 31 was 93.3%, a 20 basis point increase sequentially and a 100 basis point increase over year end 2010. Including Brazil, our leased rate at year end was 93.6%. As Dan mentioned, we continue to show consistently strong performance and improvement in our leased rate, leasing spread and same-store NOI growth. These are all continuing trends and clearly reflect the strong demand we are seeing from retailers, who continue to validate the quality of our portfolio and overall asset class through their strategic selection process. Our same-store NOI expectation for 2012 is for 2% to 3% growth. As mentioned in our guidance, we expect to recognize the majority of this growth in the back half of 2012 due to the timing of 2011 move-outs and 2012 rent commencements, most of which are already committed through prior leasing. We expect spreads and deal velocity to remain strong throughout 2012 and the year-end leased rate to improve another 100 basis points to over 94.5% prior to the impact of the proposed EDT transaction. The forecasted improvement in the leased rate will be achieved through a combination of increases in our big box and small shop leased rates, with the majority of the increase coming from the big box lease-up. While there is clearly room for growth with our small shop space, keep in mind that nearly 75% of our total portfolio GLA is made up of spaces larger than 10,000 square feet. Approximately 60% of the expected 100 basis point improvement in leased rate will be the result of leasing spaces over 10,000 square feet and 40% will be a result of leasing spaces under 10,000 square feet. As a result, our small shop leased rate is projected to improve in 2012 by approximately 150 basis points to 86%, and the leased rate for over 10,000 square feet is expected to improve by approximately 70 basis points to 97.5% by year end. While the demand story in leasing has been primarily driven by the big box category, I would like to take a few minutes to update you on our progress with small shop space, both in terms of increased occupancy as well as reduced exposure. As Dan mentioned and you can see in further detail on Page 36 of the investor presentation on our website, small shop move-ins over move-outs increased in 2010 and even more significantly so in 2011. The opportunity for additional improvement is clear and the potential for upside is compelling. In 2011, for the portion of our portfolio that consists of space less than 10,000 square feet, we increased our leased rate by 60 basis points to 84.5%. We also reduced our exposure to this size range by 30 basis points to 26.2% of our total portfolio GLA, through a combination of small shop consolidation, acquisitions of prime power centers, non-prime asset sales and creative new leasing initiatives. Regarding small shop consolidation, in 2010 and 2011, we consolidated 290 small shop units, the majority of which were previously vacant, into 119 larger units and leased them to some of the fastest-growing retailers such as Five Below, Shoe Carnival, PetSmart, Ulta, Anna's Linens, Pet Supplies Plus, Rue21, Dots, Carter's and more. These deals represent $11 million of new income to DDR, $8 million pro rata. These expanding retailers require the creative reuse and consolidation of space to meet their growth needs as they strongly desire prime centers, which are currently trending at 95% leased in our portfolio. For further detail on this initiative and examples of recent space consolidation, please refer to Page 50 of the investor presentation on our website. As you know, we are also aggressively selling assets that have greater exposure to small shop space and acquiring prime power centers with a focus on credit quality, national anchor and junior anchor tenants. A perfect example of this is our 2011 power center acquisitions. They represent over 1.4 million square feet or over 98% leased with 75% of their GLA consisting of units greater than 10,000 square feet and are anchored by national credit tenants such as Whole Foods, Kohl's, Wal-Mart, Target, PetSmart, Ulta, Harris Teeter, Bed Bath & Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Home Depot and Lowe's. We have also launched 2 new leasing programs focused exclusively on small shop leasing, set up shop and FranchiseConnect. Set up shop is currently being piloted in the Atlanta market given our large concentration of assets and our strong local presence. Since launching this program just 2 weeks ago, we have generated over 200 leads, have executed several deals and are looking forward to rolling this initiative out to additional markets in the near future. Our FranchiseConnect portal was developed in partnership with our vast range of franchise retailers such as Dunkin' Donuts, Great Clips, GNC, Subway, Panera, Menchie's, The UPS Store and many more. It provides entrepreneurs with web-based tools to research local and site-specific franchise opportunities across our portfolio. We're extremely excited about these initiatives as they not only assist in the lease-up of small shop space and improve our recovery rates, but also create new business opportunities for entrepreneurs. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made in addressing small shop vacancy and our entire portfolio, and are confident we will make significant further progress in 2012. And I look forward to keeping you posted in that regard. And I'll now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $72.1 million or $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Including nonoperating items, FFO for the quarter was $47.4 million or $0.17 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily noncash impairment charges related to the land held for development in Canada and debt extinguishment charges related to Town Center Plaza. Gains of $56 million or $0.21 per share related to the sale of Town Center Plaza and other assets were recognized during the quarter and are excluded from both FFO measures. January was an extremely active month for us as we raised over $600 million of capital, announced a recapitalization in EDT through a creatively structured transaction, and addressed the majority of our 2012 consolidated debt maturities. Our new joint venture with Blackstone will acquire the majority of the EDT retail portfolio, establishing a strategic relationship with one of the most successful real estate investors in the world. We issued nearly $250 million of common equity on a forward basis to fund the $214 million total investment in the venture, which will lower our overall leverage without FFO dilution. The majority of our investment in the venture is $150 million preferred equity interest with a fixed return of 10%, which represents a disciplined investment with an attractive risk-adjusted return. We are also pleased to have substantially addressed our 2012 consolidated debt maturities. We closed $353 million of new long-term financings comprised of a $250 million unsecured term loan and a $103 million mortgage loan. The $250 million unsecured term loan consists of $200 million 7-year tranche, with interest fixed at 3.6% through a swap contract and a $50 million 5-year tranche, with interest at LIBOR plus 170 basis points. The attractive pricing and duration further advanced our goals of reducing our risk profile and lowering our long-term cost of capital. Proceeds from the term loan will be used to retire $180 million of convertible notes maturing in March and outstanding balances under our revolving credit facilities. Our remaining 2012 consolidated unsecured debt maturities consist of $223 million of 5.4% unsecured notes that mature in October, and the company had no other unsecured maturities in the next 3 years. In addition, we now have nearly full capacity on our $800 million revolving credit facilities. Proceeds from the mortgage loan will be used to prefund our consolidated 2012 secured debt maturities, allowing us to unencumber assets throughout the year. It is important to note that we sit today with only $223 million of unsecured debt maturities over the next 3 years, a significant improvement from $2.3 billion of maturities at the end of 2008, $1.9 billion of maturities at the end of 2009 and $600 million at the end of 2010. At year end 2011, our weighted average debt maturity was 4.3 years, a significant improvement from 2.9 years at the end of 2009 and continued progress from the 3.9 years at the end of last year. Our annual maturities are very manageable, and we expect our cost of capital to continue to improve as well. Fitch upgraded our credit rating in January and all the rating agencies are very aware of the progress that we have made, and we will continue to communicate with them on a regular basis on our progress as we work to regain our consensus investment-grade ratings. Our recent transactions have further strengthened our maturity profile, and we remain absolutely committed to lowering our leverage further. In 2011, we generated $461 million of gross proceeds from asset sales, of which our share was $371 million, and an additional $71 million of assets are currently under contract for sale. Dispositions in 2011 include $57 million in proceeds from non-income producing asset sales, and we are currently under contract on an additional $21 million. We meaningfully exceeded our goal for full year and are proud to be the leader among retail REITs in recycling capital. Proceeds from asset sales represent a valuable source of capital as we funded $230 million of prime acquisitions and lowered leverage with this equity, and we expect more to come. We are very confident these recycling efforts will result in a portfolio with far better than average cash flow stability and long-term growth prospects, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. We are being very diligent in underwriting potential acquisitions, and despite a competitive market, we are pleased to be finding select off-market opportunities like our new joint venture with Blackstone and hope to be able to disclose more of what we are working on in the coming months. In January we issued 2012 FFO guidance of $0.98 to $1.04 per share. This assumes recently completed and prospective financing activity and another year of visible same-store NOI growth. It also includes $100 million of non-prime operating asset sales with net proceeds reinvested into acquisitions of prime shopping centers. We continue to feel comfortable with these metrics and hope once again to exceed this volume of capital recycling. While EBITDA and NAV per share growth continue to be our focus, we are pleased to guide to our first year of FFO per share growth in 5 years, and we expect this trend to continue. We also declared a first quarter 2012 common stock dividend of $0.12 per share, representing a 50% increase from the fourth quarter of 2011 dividend and a 200% increase from the first quarter of 2011. The dividend increase is a result of the strength of our operating platform, the high credit quality of our cash flows, our proven access to capital and minimal near-term debt maturities. The company's risk profile has been significantly reduced, allowing us to prudently return more cash to our shareholders on a regular basis, and we hope to generate additional growth as we continue to make progress on operational, capital recycling and deleveraging initiatives. While we are proud of all that we have accomplished in 2011 and so far this year, we have more work to do. We are working hard and expect to be able to announce continued progress soon on numerous operating and financing initiatives on both our wholly-owned and JV portfolio. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to reiterate my opening remarks, which highlighted the consistent execution of our operating platform and balance sheet improvement initiatives. As I've said in the past, the market may be volatile, but we are not. While it is easy to become distracted by our surroundings and the market developments that are simply outside our control, we remain disciplined and committed to achieving our long-term aspirations, reducing risk and creating value for our shareholders. Operator, at this time, we -- I'd be happy to open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: Dan, just in light of your comments, your initial comments about using monetary policy and how it's creating opportunities for you to sell assets and rightsize your balance sheet, how do you think, given that it's also clearly lowering cap rates on the prime assets that you're looking to acquire -- I mean, how do you think about pricing for prime assets right now and your appetite for that given it seems like in other areas you're trying to capitalize on financial conditions in the sense that it might be temporary.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's a great question, Paul. I think one of the things that you'll notice when you look at what we acquired -- and it's one of the reasons why we've been as selective as we have been, is that it's hard to see how we or anyone else will make money just buying core stable assets or prime stable assets that have flat growth prospects in today's market at today's pricing. That's why we are very, very focused on what we consider to be a core-plus strategy, which is going to give us upside growth opportunity outside of what might be readily apparent to the current owner of that asset. So if we take -- if we feel that we can grow that asset at a respectable rate by putting it into our platform, then it becomes attractive to us. If it's a maxed-out asset that's just fully priced, fully auctioned, it is highly unlikely we'll be able to take advantage of that in this market. So we spend an awful lot of time due-diligencing these assets with Paul and his team and then out into the retail community, and that is part of what excites us about our redevelopment platform, because some of the assets quite frankly, that we have acquired, while they may be 97%, 98% leased, they do have redevelopment, they do have expansion opportunity. They do have remerchandising opportunity that will upsize the growth opportunity and that's something we're very focused on. But I think you're right. I think if the market comes out today with a fully baked prime asset with no ""plus"" part of the core story, we will not probably be a player.
David John Oakes: Yes, in fact you're going to see us as a seller in select circumstances where we think we can recognize 6% or so cap rates on the centers that are held in joint ventures that may be prime, but where we think the future growth prospects just aren't there to justify it or the credit is a risk, and we'll redeploy that capital into 7s or an asset that we think have a better cash flow growth profile over the next several years. So even in a market that's pretty aggressively priced overall, we think the informational advantages that Dan referred to can put us in a position where we can still transact on both sides and take advantage of opportunities.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I had a question about the same-store NOI guidance. You just finished coming off a 3.5% year and it looks like the midpoint of your guidance is 2.5%, but in both cases you're having 100 base pickup in occupancy rates. What is it that's making you a little more cautious on that same store NOI number?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Craig, let me start a little bit with the timing of certain things here. There were certain of the bankruptcies we experienced last year that are going to hit us. It will hit us a little bit in the fourth quarter, it will hit us early in 2012. The Borders and Blockbuster -- obviously revenue we were receiving at this point last year. So it really is just a matter of timing. I mean, it's certainly no trend. We expect a significant pick-up as we move through 2012, but it's just the timing of certain of the negatives, which we all experienced in 2011.
David John Oakes: Part of it's the simple math also of having a higher base that we're working off of, and then specifically as we look at the specific portions of the portfolio. While Brazil continues to be a strong driver with attractive fundamentals, you're comping a year that was nearly 20% same-store NOI growth in that market, and we just don't believe that's sustainable. It doesn't mean we're not going to try to hit that in every way, but we're underwriting and budgeting to a much more normal number for that market. And the numbers down there are so significant that, that does make a difference.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: I'm on with Jordan Sadler as well. With regard to leverage today, the consolidated debt to EBITDA ended the quarter well below 7.5x, and I know that there's some seasonality in that number so it could bump up again next quarter. But David, you mentioned that you're looking to reduce leverage further. What are you targeting for leverage at the end of 2012, and what's sort of your longer-term target at this point?
David John Oakes: Yes, I think more important on the longer-term target, we talked about something in the 6 to 7x range. And I don't think we'd be shy, given the market opportunity to be at the low end or even below that range. I think when we think about it from the perspective of how do we minimize our long term cost of capital, we recognize that continuing to send a clear message that risk has been lowered and will be lowered further is important. that shows up in a couple of ways. One is the dramatic progress we've made in the maturity profile, where we spread that in a dramatic way to get to a much greater balance today. And the other side of it is just the overall amount of leverage. And so I think you will continue to see leverage as defined by debt to EBITDA decrease over the next year, but even more so over the next several years.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.
Ki Bin Kim: As you guys continue to gain occupancy, especially towards 2013 and the easier gains in same-store NOI are made, how do you think about longer-term same-store NOI growth in your portfolio without the full benefit of occupancy gains? Could you comment on that a little bit?
David John Oakes: Fundamentally, I mean, when we think about these assets on a long-term basis, whether it's us looking at the history of what we've experienced over 20 years as a public company, or when we just think about the cash flow profile over the next several years for these assets, we think prime power centers in normal sort of market should be able to grow in the 2% range on an annual basis. You're going to have some years higher, some years lower, but that's sort of what the rental rates driven and active leasing should be able to do it for us without the benefits of occupancy gains. I think we hope to add to that number even though it might not be a perfect same-store definition, but add to that overall benefit to the corporate NOI growth through redevelopment activity, where we're being proactive in changing space around, changing tenants around to make sure we've got the right format going forward and the right tenants going forward, that are going to benefit most from the trends we're seeing. And secondly, and you're seeing this in the EDT transaction, there are going to be situations where we have to acknowledge today, our inventory of vacancy is dramatically lower than it was. And while that's a good piece of news for pricing power, allowing us to push rental economics -- both rents higher and CapEx lower, it also makes us think more about increasing that inventory of vacancy. And so that's one thing that you'll see happen with the EDT transaction and potentially other transactions where we're in a much stronger position today to add some vacancy through acquisitions, vacancy that we don't believe we're paying for, and then create value and create additional NOI growth, although perhaps not perfectly same-store, over the coming quarters to years after that.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's important also to keep in mind that what gives us some confidence that our same-store NOI growth will be superior to what it had been historically for our company is that we have sold about $2.6 billion, $2.7 billion of assets over the last few years, and I'm very confident in stating that those assets were a drag. They were a significant drag on this company, and they were a significant drag on our growth rate and our same-store NOI. So we've been very proactive through the capital recycling effort and putting our capital into assets that have a much better growth profile than the ones that we traded out of. And I think as we look forward -- and we have good visibility on this particular issue, that we are excited about the same-store NOI prospects going forward particularly compared to where we had reported prior to 2007 even, forgetting the recession era, which is going to be somewhat distorted. But even in normal operating conditions, we had a number of assets that were an NOI drag on this company that are no longer part of our portfolio.
David John Oakes: Yes, and let me just add one last thing because it is an important question going forward. We're in a unique environment. We're in a great environment to improve the pricing and the credit quality, and one  great example I can use is replacing some 4-year [ph] entertainment stores with Dick's Sporting Goods. It won't show up in any kind of occupancy change. It's going to be neutral occupancy, but it'll be a significantly improved spread and a dramatic improvement to the quality of the tenant mix and the credit quality of the centers. So that's the kind of thing we're in a unique spot in, and we see that for the next couple of years.
Operator: And our next question is from Quentin Velleley with Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: I'm here with Michael Bilerman. Just in terms of the Set Up Shop incubator initiative, I'm just wondering if you could expand a little bit on that. And in particular, is the initiative going to be part of core occupancy and leasing statistics, or is it sort of going to be separated out and part of your ancillary income program? And I'm also curious just how much sort of capital that you're looking at investing and what kind of incremental returns you're hopeful of getting.
Paul W. Freddo: Okay. Quentin, it's a great question and something that we've been extremely pleased. As I mentioned in the script, we're only a few weeks into this and the reaction has been overwhelming. One thing I wanted to add that I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is that there are certain agencies we're partnered up with, loosely. SCORE is one. That's a resource organization for the SBA and this an organization of retired business professionals who help young entrepreneurs start business, grow a business, expand their business. And they're providing lots of leads for us, and it's very exciting. It's got over 13,000 members nationally. So this is really taking off in a way I didn't even expect and we'll roll it out quickly. In terms of investment, next to nothing. There may be an exception, but right now the plan is these are short-term deals, get people going with their business. And none of the negotiations we have going right now where the deals we've signed involve any investment on the part of DDR. As we've talked about previously, the initial few months we're reducing our exposure, increasing our recoveries with CAM and taxes and insurance and that's all positive. Our plan is to include these in the lease rate. We'll watch them closely, but again no investment, immediate recovery improvement and the hope is that we're finding some entrepreneurs that are going to be long-term stable tenants and grow the business, and we're bringing bodies to the centers. So it's all been extremely positive.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: As we currently compute our occupancy, Quentin, anything under a year is not included. If it's a year or over, it is included in our occupancy numbers. So if there were -- and we anticipate that these particular transactions will be over a year. If there are situations where it is under a year, it will not be included. But in most cases, it will be included because we anticipate the term to be over 12 months.
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, and we are going with 2.5 years, Quentin, as we've discussed. And again the game plan is to turn these into longer-term leases.
Operator: And our next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil.
Alexander David Goldfarb: As the Internet companies over the holidays noted the increased cost in their shipping expense, it seems to have weighed on profits. Dan, do you see that increase in shipping expense could drive more online retailers to open up physical stores? Or you really think that the driver is going to be more what happens with sales tax?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, I think it's all part of this, sort of a holistic story. It's interesting, the -- we have seen -- we've talked about this in the past and now we're starting to see signs of Amazon inquiring and looking for a bricks-and-mortar location. I think the reason why it makes sense to do that is roughly 5% of retail sales in the United States currently occurs over the Internet and 95% happens in bricks-and-mortar. And if you're a retailer, at some point I think you have to make a decision as to what is my strategy to try to access the 95% of the retail sales that are occurring in this country as opposed to just hanging out with the 5% that may someday grow to 10%, but still means you're missing the 90% that's occurring. So I do think that there is -- if you're going to talk about growth and margin, there's a huge issue obviously. I mean, Amazon does a lot of sales, but they can't make up for bad margin with more sales. So I think the model is under pressure. And I think the model, when it becomes under pressure, requires retailers to look at alternative distribution of goods because that's what they do. And when 95% of the distribution of goods in this country occur in bricks-and-mortar, and if you're a retailer you should be in bricks-and-mortar. And no different than if you are in the 95% camp, and 5% and maybe someday 10% will be happening over the Internet, you should be in that business too, which is exactly what we're seeing our retailers do in a dramatic way. So I think you need a real comprehensive strategy on both ends of the spectrum. But I do think we're going to see much, much more pressure on the Internet retailers to: number one, actually show profit. Show profit that is reasonable based on the volume, because otherwise, the model simply becomes somewhat questionable if they are unable to produce the same type of margin that bricks-and-mortar retailers produce, with really a lower expense structure in many cases. So I think the sales tax is part of it. I think that'll help. I don't think that's going to be the driver, one way or the other. I think it's where the consumer buys their goods ultimately is the driver to what your retail strategy is. And I think you're going to see it happen on both ends of the spectrum, but I do think Internet retailers are going to have to figure out how to access the 90% to 95% of the retail sales that are occurring in the United States today and that are not occurring on the Internet.
Operator: And our next question is from Jay Habermann with Goldman Sachs.
Jonathan Habermann: A question, Dan, on strategy. As your portfolio becomes more prime and obviously less NOI from the non-prime, I'm just curious how you're thinking about CapEx for some of the non-prime centers. Are you seeking to increase occupancy to sort of accelerate the sales? Are you looking to just sell the asset as is? And I guess also you had mentioned maybe sort of selling some of the JV assets. I'm just wondering if we might see sort of any unwinding of any partnerships this year.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, Jay, the answer to the first question is a little bit of both. I can tell you that there are many situations where it is not worth the dollars -- the enhanced dollars, the capitalized value of the enhanced dollars of waiting for lease-up on assets that aren't going to move the needle one way or the other. So we're being very, very prudent with our CapEx. Where we have obvious lease-up potential and we get a decent return on that lease-up potential, we are pursuing that. But the capitalized value on just pure lease-up on some of these assets that we're selling -- but again, they're very, very small. The rents are very, very low. And the cap rate is typically pretty high. So you're really not talking about any cost-benefit analysis by waiting, particularly if we have alternative investments where we can redeploy that capital in a more prudent manner. In regard to our joint ventures, we're constantly working with our joint venture partners to do what is prudent, not just for their shareholders, but for our shareholders. And if the market presents opportunities for us to unwind certain ventures, we will do that. We have done quite a bit of that in the last year or so, and I think that will continue as we want to simplify our story. And we want to partner with large institutions like Blackstone -- which helps simplify the story, not complicate the story, versus multiple joint ventures with smaller partners with sometimes an uncertain future on the back end.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: I guess this question's for David. When do you think we're going to see your operating and reported FFO per share converge, I guess, and the impairments and charges start to dissipate? And then specific to this quarter, I was just curious what was behind the $200 million impairment in your unconsolidated JVs and why your share seemed so small.
David John Oakes: We've seen considerable convergence over the past couple of years between our operating FFO and FFO. Most of that is because we've cleaned up a number of aspects of the business. We've acknowledged some of the write-downs related to 2006 and '07 investment activity. And we think we're in a much stronger position today. We provide operating FFO because we do think it's the appropriate run rate number, but that also leads to exactly your question: when will it be the run rate? And we think we're very close to that today. The charges, the noncash items that impact that spread are getting smaller, and we would expect that to continue. That said, we are going to run the business to get the best long-term outcome for our shareholders, and in some cases that does mean recognizing a loss now rather than just sitting on something and carrying it at book value. So I think there's the potential to continue to see some sort of noise there, but do think directionally you've seen it get a lot smaller, and we would expect that to continue. Specifically, on the joint venture financials, the write-down related to one of the joint ventures associated with the Inland transaction, where DDR -- to your question specifically: why was our write-down so much smaller? DDR had written down, in the past, our portion of the venture. However, the venture itself had not taken that charge, so that's why you saw a large charge at the joint-venture level and an extremely small one at the DDR level.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tom Truxillo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas C. Truxillo: Two questions on balance sheet here. Obviously, you've done a great job in increasing your liquidity and extending your debt maturity. But by doing that, you've also kind of limited your ability to further reduce debt, at least easily reduce debt. Does that mean it's fair to say that you think EBITDA growth is going to be mainly responsible for getting you to that leverage goal of 6 to 7x? And then as a follow-on and kind of just as importantly, because it seems to be the most -- the focus of agencies right now, you've done a good job of reducing the cost of your debt as well. If your debt reduction opportunities are limited, are there other opportunities to kind of decrease your cost of debt so that you improve that coverage? Or again is that coverage improvement going to primarily come from EBITDA growth?
David John Oakes: I do think EBITDA growth will be the primary driver on a go-forward basis. On a look-back basis, the majority of the leverage improvement related to lower debt with EBITDA that was on a same-store basis growing, but on an overall basis because of asset sales was still flat to declining. On a go-forward basis, I think EBITDA growth will be dramatically more important to that metric, but it's not at all to say that we won't continue to reduce debt. And I think we do have continuing opportunities to reduce debt. We're proud to have a much longer duration profile on our debt. But we still have $200 million of maturities this year and $300 million to $400 million -- $300 million to $500 million for the next several years, so there's still opportunities to reduce debt. It's not as if everything is fixed for 10 years, where there's no good way to get at it. And so I still think there's  some opportunities there but I would absolutely say that [ph] growth is more important driver of debt to EBITDA. The [ph] improvements on a look-forward basis, and we think that hopefully we're making them more and more visible through continued same-store NOI growth, as well as primarily redevelopment and a joint venture related to [indiscernible] basis development EBITDA that is improving consistently. The second question regarding our cost of debts. We've done a lot over the past couple of years in terms of duration extension, where we've had to say we're taking much more expensive debt, replacing cheaper debt, but we're getting the duration that we think is crucial to our long-term cost of capital. Today, we think we're in a situation where we can generally replace maturing debt with cheaper debt as we look out over the next year and especially as we look out a few years and you think about the 9 5/8% notes that mature in '16 and other higher coupon debt in the out years. I think there is select opportunities where we could think about refinancing our preferred equity at a lower rate. So while we don't have massive amounts of debt maturing over the next couple of years, which we obviously view as a positive generally, we do still think there are enough ways where we can take advantage of the current low cost of capital to refinance debt lower and improve our fixed-charge coverage ratio. And you've seen that exactly with some of the financings during the quarter, where we're taking out low- to mid 3% debt and replacing debt generally at a couple-of-hundred-basis-point higher level.
Operator: And our next question is from Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.
Carol L. Kemple: What was your spread between leased and occupancy in the quarter?
Paul W. Freddo: In our account, it was 240 basis points.
Carol L. Kemple: And where do you see that by the end of 2012?
Paul W. Freddo: Well, let me -- it should be narrower, but one of the pleasant surprises in the quarter was the fact it didn't narrow anywhere near as much as I thought. And that's a real credit to the amount of deals, the deal velocity we saw in the fourth quarter, because there were certainly a significant number of move-ins. And the deal velocity exceeded what I had thought going into the quarter, and that's obviously good news. And we see that trend continuing. So in the past, I typically answer that question where we should see this narrow and the fact is, we've seen it consistently in that 200 to 250, 260 basis point spread. And that's okay. The fact that we've got a lot of signed leases that haven't commenced rent yet and will in later 2012 and early 2013 is a very good thing.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We consistently wait for this to narrow, not yet to historic levels, which as you know, were sub-100. But in that 150 to 175 ranges will be consistently projected because we do not see leasing velocity -- or we hadn't thought that leasing velocity would keep up at the pace that it obviously has. And you start doing -- over the last 3 years, we've done roughly 11 million feet of leasing a year. Those are very big numbers for us. And we keep waiting for big quarters to end up with a more quiet quarter because again, sometimes the tenant -- it takes a while to refill the queue. But right now, the way the market has been and the way the retailers are receiving our portfolio, we're seeing consistent velocity that is keeping the gap wider than we would have thought. And like Paul said, that's the good news. That's the good news because occupancy continues to go up, the leased rate continues to go up and the velocity continues to stay fairly constant. And it'll be interesting to see how long that will continue, but it's something that we're very pleased with, obviously.
Operator: And our next question is from Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: Paul, you talked about consolidating a couple of hundred small shop spaces into bigger boxes earlier. Curious about the TI [ph] cost associated with that or the overall CapEx cost. And also interested in knowing a little more about what is the ultimate net effective rent on those boxes versus what you were able to achieve on the small shop space.
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Cedric, the capital investment is very consistent with what we've seen across any of our re-leasing, averages somewhere in the mid-teens. And the good news on the consolidations, and I think we've talked about this on prior calls, is that the -- we're seeing investment on the part of the retailers. That was not their position 3 or 3.5 years ago, but that's been very consistent with some of the guys who want to downsize, whether it's one of the office guys or a Best Buy or a Jo-Ann's or an Old Navy specifically. They're putting money into the deal, so we're not seeing any extraordinary level of investment, and the net effective rents are right in there with our averages. They're going to be in that $13, $14 a foot range. So there's no significant difference just because of the consolidation. Keep in mind, some of the consolidated spaces were chronically vacant spaces. We used a couple examples, and if you look into the investor presentation as I mentioned, I mean, this was stuff that hadn't earned us anything for several years. And so we're in there with the mid-teens or somewhere in that vicinity on rent, with a typical investment and it's all of a sudden producing in a big way when it hadn't produced in years for us.
Operator: And our next question comes with a follow-up from Samit Parikh with ISI.
Samit Parikh: I want to ask you about Brazil and just the future plans there really, and I guess 3 projects delivering in the next 2 years. Is there any insight you can give us sort of on future investment plans, how much more greenfield development you plan to do in the near term? And pretty much that's about it.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That's a great question. It's a question we ask ourselves all the time. Right now we have 3 greenfield projects, as you mentioned, under construction. We acquired another piece of property for a future project in Brazil, and it's a market that we have to monitor as we go. Brazil has been very exciting. It's been very positive for us in a lot of ways, but it's an emerging market and where there's emerging market, there's volatility. And things can change very quickly in those markets and we're aware of that. That's why we have structured our transaction there by doing the IPO with maximum flexibility for us. We have no plans to exit Brazil at this point in time, and in fact, we'd still see great opportunity and great value creation in Brazil. We have a team of about 145 people in Brazil. We have an outstanding development and leasing team that are out looking for opportunities on a regular basis. We're going back and looking at how we can maximize value at our existing assets as well, do an aggressive redevelopment program. We continue to see multiple tenants interested in coming to Brazil that aren't there now. And we continue to see great growth of the middle class and disposable income increasing at sort of historic levels. So we'll continue to monitor that situation. It's part of our -- it's absolutely part of our platform. Right now it's about 8% of our NOI. When the centers open, the 3 centers that you mentioned, it will be in that 12% to 13% of our NOI, and we'll continue to monitor it going from there. But right now, we've always been very prudent in Brazil in looking at the development opportunities, and we will continue to do that. But as we look forward in Brazil, it's hard to talk really about a market like Brazil on a 5-year plan, because 5 years is an awful long time in a market like that. And as David mentioned earlier, we're seeing year-to-year changes pretty dramatic. Even though the numbers are still very compelling, they go up and down pretty dramatically, from a same-store NOI perspective in particular. So we'll continue monitor that and make sure that we're capitalizing on the opportunities and maximizing the value.
David John Oakes: Another way we address it is just our financing activity down there where because of the IPO almost exactly 12 months ago, we do sit on a considerable amount of cash that will represent the equity that funds most of that activity. And so I think we're careful and prudent not to combine financial risk along with the operating development and emerging market risk that Dan referred to. So I think that's where we see an important balance where we can take advantage of those opportunities, but do so in a very low leverage, and at this point even negative leverage net cash fashion and we think that's a prudent way to participate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: I just want to go back to the leasing velocity commentary. It sounds like it's persisted longer than you had expected. Just wondering in terms of the 2012 occupancy guidance, what kind of leasing velocity is baked into that? I mean, it seems like it's been in the, call it, 500,000 square feet a quarter. And then as part of that, just wondering what your expeditions around the renewal rate will be for 2012.
Paul W. Freddo: Okay. On the velocity we're expecting slightly below what we achieved in 2011, but I'd tell you, our first quarter has kicked off in a big way. And we may address that at some other point, but right now that's what's baked into our full year occupancy. The thing to remember is the level of demand. I know we haven't talked a lot about it on this call, but we have in the past. There's a tremendous amount of demand out there, and there is still no new supply. And that is what's driving the deal velocity. And as I mentioned in my example of Dick's replacing a weaker retailer, that's not even going to show up in the occupancy rate. But it is going to show up in the deal velocity, and we're going to see more of that. So we're expecting strong velocity again, and we're seeing no signs of slowing down at this point. Renewal rate hasn't changed at all. We've typically been in that high-80s in terms of a percentage of renewals, but we're taking a much more particular and selective stance even with the renewals, and that again is based on the demand. So we feel good about where we are with the '12 renewals. We expect no dip -- in fact, improvement in the retention rate on renewals and again we can be more selective in how we're going after those renewals in terms of rate and based on the level of demand out there today.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: What do you think the yields are on those Brazilian developments, number one? And then would you look anywhere else besides Brazil that's x U.S. for other opportunities?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The yields on an unlevered cash on cost basis, Rich, are about in the middle teens on a very consistent basis as with a lot of developments. And talking to others and from past experience in emerging markets, they start higher than that. So I'm happy to tell you that when we approved the deals, they started higher than that, but that's not really where they come in. They come in more in the middle teens. And we think that, that's a good number to go on, moving forward. Right now, we're not looking to go anywhere else. Our plate is full. If you look at our domestic, our Puerto Rico redevelopment portfolio and you look at what's going on in Brazil and what we think can happen in Brazil moving forward, we think that is a sufficient amount of risk and a sufficient amount of opportunity for us to grow our business in a prudent manner.
David John Oakes: Yes, those are markets where we think we have an advantage -- operating platform, our team, our knowledge. And I just can't say we could make the case for anywhere besides that at this point, that we have that same advantage and operating platform and information.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: David, just a quick question, where do you see overall CapEx levels for 2012? And then tied to that as well, you've had a couple of dividend increases over the past 1 or 2 quarters. Does it feel like the next increase is coming, it's more of a 2013 event at this point?
David John Oakes: Yes, on the CapEx side, we have been seeing elevated levels of total CapEx because the leasing velocity has been so high, so I think we're proud that the CapEx has been higher because it's been tied to velocity, while CapEx per square foot has still been relatively low. It's just been a much larger volume of square feet. I think as we continue to see a positive leasing environment, we continue to see momentum there, we continue to see the economics of leases move more in our favor, part of that shows up in better leasing spreads. And part of it shows up very importantly in lower CapEx per square foot. So I do think you'll still see CapEx in '12 that is above our historic norm, but you'll probably see it trend down on an operating, leasing CapEx basis, forgetting redevelopment. You'll see that trend down simply because the economics continue to get more in our favor even though the amount of square footage is still going to be quite high. Secondly, on the dividend, 2012 did represent an important transition -- or 2011, excuse me, did represent an important transition year for us, where we moved from the extreme caution of retaining basically as much capital as we could back to a much more normalized payout ratio. And we did that through several bumps throughout the year. We had articulated until we had dealt with a majority of our maturities, this management team really felt uncomfortable recommending increases to our board. And so when we saw the volume of refinancing activity we were able to do early in 2011, made the case that the dividend can start getting higher from there and our board agreed and approved that. We do believe with, what was approved for the first quarter of 2012 and the way that we tried to talk about it in our guidance where we guided to a $0.48 annual figure, we do think we're back to a more normal policy at this point where we absolutely forecast growth near-term and long-term in cash flow from this portfolio. And we think you'll see that show up in increased dividends over time. But I would expect at this point, unless something meaningfully changed, that we'd be back in a position where we announce an annual dividend policy -- obviously approved each quarter, but where you'd expect to see the growth come once a year and then a consistent policy for the remaining 3 quarters of the year.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: Just in terms of just putting some of your comments together in terms of increasing the proportion of prime assets and continuing to delever and simplify the story, if we look at the EDT transaction with Blackstone, I guess, was there a consideration of buying a larger equity stake or even the whole portfolio? It just seems that you sort of had the inside running on the deal. You know the assets intimately. 7.4% cap rate with occupancy upside sort of suggests that, whilst most of them are sort of core assets, there's that plus in that there's additional upside to them. And the ingoing yield was attractive, so I'm just sort of curious on how you guys thought about that.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, I'll start. We thought about it a lot because -- I think you're exactly right, Quentin. We saw the same things that you saw. Obviously it would have been totally contradictory to our strategy to consider increasing our debt levels to acquire more of the portfolio. And we weren't really in love with our price of equity at the time to issue more equity to increase our position. We feel that, that was -- there are times when it makes sense to issue equity below NAV. We felt that this was a prudent way to do it, because again it could help us delever without diluting our FFO. But to take a much bigger stake was a much greater cost, we felt. So we like the opportunity, and we wish our balance sheet was in a position to have been more aggressive on the transaction, but we felt that we weren't quite there yet. And that's one of the reasons. And I think probably the most important reason why we negotiated so hard for the right of first offer on the 10 best assets in the portfolio, because I'm confident that we'll get another shot at increasing our position in the 10 assets that recovered the most. And when we do get that shot, we feel very comfortable also that our balance sheet will be in much better shape than it was last month, to take advantage of that opportunity. So we get another bite at the apple, and it's our job to work hard to make sure that we're in a position to maximize the benefit of that opportunity.
Operator: And we have a follow-up question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Yes, can you tell us what your same-store NOI and leasing spreads were in the quarter at your pro rata share, or perhaps just for the continental U.S.? I'm just curious what the effect is without Puerto Rico and Brazil.
Paul W. Freddo: On the spreads, they're calculated at 100%. We didn't break it down by pro rata share.
David John Oakes: On the spreads, you're not going to see much of a difference there, just because Brazil isn't that large of a portion and because you get such significant annual bumps even though you're seeing incredible NOI growth down there. A lot of it through bumps and not leasing spreads that are that different than what we experience here, although they are a little bit higher. So I'd say on the spread side, there's not going to be much of a difference. On the overall same-store NOI, throughout the year we've been at about a 70 basis point spread between the results at 100% compared to the results at our pro rata share. And the main driver of that was the significantly higher results -- higher same-store NOI in Brazil. We think that will -- that spread will be reduced as we look out to next year. And so our guidance that we've talked about for next year of 2% to 3% same-store NOI growth is actually on a pro rata basis, because we expect that spread to be much smaller.
Operator: And we have a follow-up from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Macquarie.
Ki Bin Kim: A similar question. How do you account for FX and same-store NOI? Is it the completely exclusive?
David John Oakes: Yes, we basically say what's the local growth. And so the level of FX is fixed for both periods. So obviously you do see our actual bottom line financial results impacted by FX, because we have to translate for income statement purposes at whatever the appropriate rate for the period is. But for same-store NOI, we think the appropriate way to look at it -- we think the question that you're trying to get to is how are the assets growing in local terms, not how did the currency change. And certainly our investment in Brazil is not dependent -- or wasn't a gamble on exchange rates. It was on the opportunity we see with the assets, and so our same-store stats are all reported on a fixed-FX basis. So there's no benefits -- or in the current period, more likely where you'd have a detriment. But none of that is reflected in same-store NOI. It is, however, of course reflected in the income statement at whatever the current period translation rate is.
Operator: And a follow-up question from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: On the G&A, you had a charge of $1.4 million in the quarter for executive separation. What was that exactly? And do you think you have more separation charges to come this year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: As you know, Rich, we continue to build the team here, and we continue to pursue individuals that we think could have a dramatic impact on continuing to build the franchise. And that means that you have to make tough decisions at year end on individuals that have been working here, some of them for quite some time. And that would just be normal policy-driven separation charges for a few our members of our executive committee who are no longer with us and we've replaced with people that we feel can have a bigger impact on the organization.
Operator: And another follow-up from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neil.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Yes. When you guys look at your landholdings or mothballed developments, are any of those -- do you think any of those will be suitable for an outlet where one of the outlet developers would be more interested in that land than may make sense for you guys?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We've looked at that, Alex, and in fact, in my 12 years here, we looked at that on a pretty consistent basis. And we actually did sell one piece of land many years ago that is now a very successful outlet. But their criteria is very, very specific for their business and not always consistent with ours. We do -- obviously, we have great relationships with the people that are the leaders in that field. We have talked to them on a regular basis about our landholdings because we are aggressively trying to reduce it. But as of now, I would say the likelihood of that happening is pretty slim, because again their standards and their requirements are a little different than ours. Also as you know, a lot of the outlets have -- need a respectable distance from full-price retail, particularly those that are generated by large and super regional malls. And a lot of our sites are very close to malls. And so the overlap would preclude leasing in some cases. So we think about that, we look at it, we get excited when we hear about the great success and expansion that the outlet guys are having. And we certainly go to them with our land portfolio, but I think the likelihood of a transaction is pretty low.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Again, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at the conclusion of the first quarter. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect. Have a good day."
16,SITC,1,2012,2012-05-02 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jasmine, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. On today's call you will hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning and thank you for joining us. We continue to be very pleased with our operating results, performance of our platform, sales results and growth aspirations of our retail partners and the receptivity we continue to receive from the capital markets. All factors, when combined, continue to provide consistent performance, long-term value creation and a simplified story that continues to enjoy a very positive momentum. Paul and David will provide you with more details in a moment, but suffice it to say we are very pleased with our progress and remained firmly committed to the strategic objectives that we have articulated to the market over the past few years. The strategy is working and we have no reason to doubt its continued success. Undesirable assets are being sold; quality assets are being bought; vacancy is being leased and occupancy rates continue to grow with improved credit quality of cash flows; projects are being redeveloped, providing new store opportunities for our retail partners; access to capital is abundant as leverage metrics continue to improve and our maturity profile continues to expand; and NAV continues to grow as financial engineering and short-term FFO focus continues to become a distant memory. So overall, we are very pleased and see continued runway for continued positive results moving forward. Before turning the call over to Paul I'd, like to share with you one observation that I have noticed over the past few months as I have traveled to meet with many of you through the non-deal roadshow process. Whether it's folks trying to grab catchy headlines at the expense of actual retail operating results or individuals attempting to paint a specific business with an inappropriately broadbrush, it's important to keep in mind that the success of our tenants is completely dependent on the merchandising presented to the consumer by our retailers and the receptivity that, that consumer has to the inventory contained in the store. While many attempt to link the issues of our retailer like Best Buy with the fate of other junior anchor retailers, it's important to keep in mind that comparing the market conditions of a Best Buy to the market conditions of a T.J. Maxx or Bed Bath & Beyond, for example, is equal to comparing the results of Sears to that of a department store such as Macy's. There simply is no link. These are vastly different companies with vastly different strategies, different merchandising expertise and therefore, vastly different results. There is no broad generalization that one can make intelligently about merchandising except the obvious conclusion that great merchants win and bad merchants lose. And since we live in a world with great transparency, guessing and sweeping generalization is simply not necessary. The future of the department store is not linked to the fate of a struggling company, no differently than the future of a junior anchor is linked to the fate of a struggling co-tenant, especially when they consistently trade in different merchandise at a different price point. The numbers are what they are. That is why retailers that operate side-by-side in the same asset consistently show vastly different results. It's not primarily about the real estate and it's not primarily about the box. It's what's inside the box that matters and will ultimately determine the success or failure of a retail concept. It's not about whether you operate in a mall, outlet center, power center or grocery anchored neighborhood center, it's about the merchandise you present to the consumer as a merchant whose primary task is to distribute the right goods, at the right time, at the right price. Clearly, certain retail asset classes are better suited for some retailers over others. That is why some of us have unique proprietary relationships with our top tenants. And quality real estate absolutely enhances the opportunity to succeed. However, if you are a lousy merchant in the best Simon mall or outlet center or a lousy merchant in the best regency or federal neighborhood center or a lousy merchant in the best DDR power center, the real estate will not bail you out. We have seen this play out time and time again since the inception of the shopping center, and this fact will not change. Retailers win on product and not on just location, marketing, public relations and image campaigns. While those aspects are important as part of the business, they will not prevail if they drive consumers into the store for a consistently disappointing experience. Again, that is why you see vacancy in assets at superior locations with enviable overall sales productivity and we also see surprising structural vacancy at the most celebrated and well-managed portfolios that produce the highest sales per square foot results in all of retail. The real estate provides the opportunity for sure, but clearly not all retailers are successful in capitalizing. So as retailers in every asset class are forced to retool their merchandising strategy to adjust to the changing needs and demands of the consumer, it is important to keep in mind that effort is very individual and makes almost no statement about the visibility of the asset class in general. Some will adapt and some will disappear. Either speaks directly to the retailer merchandising strategy, the response to competition and the confidence of the corporate merchant group. At the end of the day, while there are many aspects of the retail business that must be considered, none is more important than the merchandising strategy of the individual retailer and the consumer acceptance or rejection of the inventory contained within the 4 walls of the box, whether that box is 2,000 square feet or 200,000 square feet. As you think of the challenging business headlines for every retail segment, whether at certain department stores, at particular junior anchor, grocer or even mom-and-pop results, keep in mind that retail is an intensely competitive, unprotected business. Good ideas today are employed by your competitors tomorrow. But strong competition breeds excellence for those well-prepared and talented enough to respond. So like the retail real estate business, platform matters for retailers as well, and ultimately, the merchandising strategy of the platform will determine the fate of an operator over time regardless of what may be happening in the space next door. I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. Today I want to call attention to one aspect of our re-leasing results that speaks volumes about the operational performance of our platform, and that is the positive trends we are experiencing within our lease renewal results. It's easy for these results to be overshadowed by the variety of good news being generated by our portfolio, but renewals make the strongest and most economically meaningful statement about existing sales, productivity, profitability and asset quality. In Q1, we had a record volume of renewals with 367 deals, representing 2.3 million square feet of space. This number is approximately 20% higher than the quarterly square foot average we achieved in 2011, which in and of itself was a record year. This success is directly attributable to the quality of our portfolio combined with the landlord-friendly supply/demand dynamic. Our results also highlight the fact that retailers are increasingly unwilling to lose an irreplaceable store at a prime asset. Economically, we executed these renewals at a 5.4% rental increase on a cash basis and more importantly, on a pro rata basis to spread gross to 5.9%. Similarly, first quarter new deals were executed at a 6% rental increase. And on a pro rata basis, this spread is 300 basis points higher at 9%. These spreads are bolstered by our continued efforts to dispose of non-prime assets to enhance our overall portfolio quality. Clearly, this strategy has been a great success and we continue to enjoy the addition of positive metrics through the substraction of lesser quality assets. Importantly, this quarter's renewal metrics represent a continuation of positive renewal spread that dates back to the second quarter of 2010. Moreover, as our overall occupancy number continues to increase and the supply/demand metric continues to favor the landlord community, I fully expect renewal rates to stabilize in the mid- to high single digits going forward. As also disclosed in our supplement, renewals are achieved with little to no CapEx and require no downtime, so the economic impact of these transactions is even more meaningful as we are enhancing overall portfolio rental growth without buying the gain. As a result of strong overall first quarter activity, our lease rate as of March 31, was 93.7%. This represents a 10 basis point increase sequentially and a 110 basis point increase annually. This increase is particularly impactful as historically, we have seen an average decline in occupancy in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of tenant fallout, lease expirations and limited commencements. It's also important to note that the first quarter stability is highly indicative of a vastly improved credit quality of cash flow and the strong credit profile of our key tenants. Going forward, we expect continued stability as our tenant watch list continues to be slim and dispositions, when coupled with recent acquisitions, additionally fortify that segment of our income stream. From a leasing perspective, we remain confident in our ability to maintain momentum throughout 2012 and we'll keep you posted on future occupancy guidance as the year progresses. In that regard, we will be attending RECon in Las Vegas in a few weeks where we will get additional color on the leasing environment for the remainder of 2012 and beyond. Since we meet with our tenants on a regular basis, we are rarely surprised by any news that comes out of RECon, but we are always inquisitive as we determine our role in the delivery of space for future retailer open-to-buys that are often discussed in detail at this show. As I'm sure many of you saw on our press release after the Best Buy store closing announcement, the impact to us was negligible. You may ask yourself why that was, and the answer is very simple: the stores that populate our centers make money, and that is the quintessential factor for a viable retailer making such a real estate decision. In that regard, you can also assume that the stores slated to close do not make money and the company would be more profitable without them. Interestingly, the decision to close had nothing to do with door size or how close to one of the coast the store was. Also not shocking to us, it had nothing to do with how many people reside in the 3-mile radius. In fact, the store closings announced included coveted markets such as New York City, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco and D.C. Markets that many have paid and will continue to pay a premium to enter. Using a 7-mile range, those actual store closings had average populations of about 1.5 million people, with over $100,000 in average household income. While these numbers are staggeringly impressive, to Dan's earlier point, they do not guarantee success. That's 5 closed just 50 of their least profitable stores, and economics drove the decision, not demographics and not proximity to an ocean. Smart investment decisions are based on operating results and profitability driven by merchandising. And once again, great ammos and great real estate cannot bail out poor performance. Going forward, we are encouraged that Best Buy is pursuing a management change and hopefully, a revised merchandising strategy will not be far behind. But once again, this closure list proves that retail is a local business driven by local results and regardless of who occupies the space at any given time, the results can and will be dramatically different. This is why we stay close to our tenants, evaluate our real estate accordingly and do not become intoxicated with numbers that often have no bearing on future success. And finally, as Dan mentioned, there are winners and losers in the retail game of market share. If you haven't already read the note published on Monday by Adrianne Shapira, Managing Director and Retail Equity Analyst at Goldman Sachs, you should. Adrianne's note estimates the significant market share loss of J. C. Penney and points out who the obvious winners are in picking up that business, most of whom are value-oriented retailers and key tenants in our portfolio. This shift in market share goes well beyond this specific example. Over the past decade, we have seen a secular shift in the business, away from department stores to value-oriented retailers such as Ross; TJX, with its various concepts; Target; Bed Bath & Beyond; and others. As we all know, retail is a game of taking market share, and it's very reassuring to see our primary tenants capture the market share loss of a struggling competitor. And with that, I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $66.8 million, or $0.24 per share, for the first quarter. Including nonoperating items, FFO for the quarter was $59.7 million, or $0.21 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily lost on the retirement proportion of our 9 5/8% unsecured notes during the quarter. Operating results and operating FFO per share came in above our internal projections as reflected in our guidance for slower growth in the first half of 2012. We are pleased with our operating performance this quarter with pro rata same-store NOI growth of 2.3%, including approximately 2% growth in our domestic portfolio. And we continue to feel comfortable that these results will accelerate in each of the next 3 quarters of the year based upon the visible pipeline of signed leases. Over the last few years, you've seen us aggressively pursue opportunities to position DDR for above average long-term growth and net asset value while also lowering the company's risk profile and cost of capital. And we are very pleased with what we've been able to accomplish in that regard so far in 2012. Since the beginning of the year, we raised close to $700 million of capital comprised of nearly $320 million of equity and over $350 million of debt, with an average interest rate of 3.3% and term of 6.6 years. During the first 4 months of the year, we committed $340 million of investment in high-quality prime shopping centers, all of which will be funded with proceeds from equity issued and asset sale proceeds. Financing attractively priced acquisitions with equity and the proceeds of asset sales has allowed us to significantly grow our portfolio of unencumbered wholly-owned prime shopping centers. Our recently high-quality balance sheet acquisitions in Chicago, Portland and Phoenix were added to the unencumbered pool, further improving the size and quality of that portfolio. Today, our unencumbered pool consists of 193 shopping centers that generate approximately $300 million of NOI. During the first quarter, we substantially addressed all of our 2012 consolidated debt maturities. The debt capital I referred to earlier was used to retire $184 million of convertible notes that matured in March, reduced outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities and effectively prefund all of our 2012 mortgage debt maturities. Remaining maturities consist of $223 million of unsecured notes maturing in October and $13 million of mortgage debt. And we have nearly full availability on our $815 million revolving credit facilities. We have no other unsecured bonds maturing in the next 3 years, further enhancing our flexibility. In March 31, our weighted average debt maturity was 4.5 years, a significant improvement from 2.9 years at the end of 2009 and continued progress from the 3.9 years at the end of 2010, 4.3 years at the end of 2011. Our annual maturities are very manageable, and we expect our cost of capital to continue to improve as well. Fitch upgraded our credit rating in January and S&P upgraded our outlook to positive in February. Our progress since then is lowered leverage and strength in our maturity profile. And we remain absolutely committed to lowering leverage further as we work to regain our consensus in investment grade ratings. With respect to unconsolidated debt maturities, our DDR TC venture has obtained commitments for the refinancing of the $540 million term loan and the $200 million revolving credit facility, and we expect to close those 3- to 5-year financings in the coming weeks. These transactions are direct the majority of our 2012 earnings consolidated maturities, and we are actively making progress on the remainder. In the first quarter, we generated gross proceeds of $45 million through asset sales. Included in these figures is $27 million from the sale of non-inc producing [non-income producing] assets, including our development site in Yaroslavl, 1 of 2 land assets [ph] in Russia. An additional $81 million of assets are currently under contract for sale, including $29 million of non-inc producing assets. Since 2010, DDR has disposed of $1.3 billion of primarily non-prime assets in secondary and tertiary markets. The non-prime assets sold were 72% leased, and average household incomes and populations within a 7-mile radius were approximately $69,000 and 239,000 people, respectively. In comparison, our $450 million of prime investments since 2011 were 96% leased, and average household incomes and populations were approximately $84,000 and 360,000 people, respectively. As you can see, through our capital recycling program, we've been able to significantly strengthen the quality of the portfolio from demographic credit quality of cash flow and long-term NOI growth and stability perspective. We are being very diligent in underwriting potential acquisitions and despite a competitive market, we are pleased to be finding select off-market opportunities. Since you probably noticed from our press release, we've raised the low-end of our 2012 guidance by $0.02 and now project operating FFO per share of $1 to $1.04 for the full year, up from the range of $0.98 to $1.04 originally provided in January. Strong operating results during the first 4 months of the year relative to budget combined with the volume of tenant closures below what we projected in the lower end of our range drove the change in our 2012 guidance. We continue to project same-store NOI growth of 2% to 3% for the year, with the majority of this growth in the back half of 2012, and we are pleased to be comfortable in raising our guidance at this time despite accelerated steps to improve portfolio and balance sheet quality. While EBITDA and NAV per share growth continue to be our focus, we are encouraged to guide to our first year of FFO per share growth in 5 years, and we expect this trend to continue. At this point operator, we would be happy to turn the call over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Mr. Craig Smith with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: Dan or Paul or whoever, I'm just wondering have the best power centers in the nation already been built? Are we kind of approaching some sort of maturity? And it seems like when development slowed it was more cyclical but as time passes, you start to think it may be somewhat systemic?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think that's a great question, Craig, and I don't think we really know the answer to that. We know that there's not a lot of great power centers being built and I don't think there's going to be a lot being built going forward and certainly in the near future. I do think there's going to be additional opportunity over time because there are lifecycles to retail projects. As we see, all retail projects have a lifecycle, and there's going to be an opportunity to recycle some of those properties and with new formats, new merchandising strategies, new tenants, there is going to be an opportunity at some point for growth of development in our business. But I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. And I think that as we continue to watch market share shift to the primary tenants and power centers that will beg the question of whether there should be additional external growth to accommodate that market share shift, and we're going to have to address that going forward. But I think we're going to start having that conversation a lot more in the next 12 months and the reason is, as 2012 open-to-buys, I think, are in good shape. 2013, I think we will find -- and when we talked to tenants in Vegas, are not in great shape. And certainly, 2014 are certainly not in great shape. And meeting open-to-buy requirements is going to put an awful lot of pressure on the retailer. What that actually does for development and whether that generates new opportunity, we'll have to wait and see. But it is definitely a topic that is going to be discussed thoroughly, and I think it's going to become a more substantial discussion in the next 12 months.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy: I know this gets talked about every quarter and all of you guys have talked about getting a better sense for the leasing environment at ICSC, but just wanted to hear your updated thoughts. The lease to commence occupancy GAAP is at 200 basis points now, you've talked about the potential for that narrowing down to maybe 150 to 175 or have been, in the longer term backed down to a more normal [Audio Gap]. The leasing velocity's been good and the leased rate keeps increasing. So I'm wondering after another quarter of leasing embedded in your guidance, where do you see the company at yearend in terms of both the leased rate and the leased to occupancy GAAP? And David, you talked about higher same-store NOI growth sort of at the back half of the year, is that because of timing of lease commencement?
Paul W. Freddo: Christy this is Paul, and I'll start with the spread between the commenced and leased and the leased occupancy. We're comfortable 4 months into the year with our prior guidance of 100-basis-point improvement over yearend 2011 in occupancy, and it's still early. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, so we're comfortable with that number. There might possibly be some adjustments as we close on the EDT Blackstone transaction later in the second quarter. But again, we're comfortable with the 100-basis-point improvement. In terms of the spread, you and I talked about this for many quarters now, it's -- we're in uncharted waters with the 200 basis points spread between commenced and leased rate, and it has to come down. It hasn't come down as quickly as we thought. It actually came down a little bit in the first quarter and part of that was fewer move outs and some activity in Brazil, but the fact is, it has to come down as we move closer and closer to a full occupancy number. But I wouldn't even venture a guess because we've been wrong before in terms of where that spread's going to be over the next few quarters. But it's, certainly, not going to get down to that historic rate of 50 to 100 basis points by the end of this year. We still have that spread, but it has to come down.
David John Oakes: And on the back half of your question Christy, the higher same-store NOI growth later in the year. The direction of your question was exactly in line with the way we're looking at it and budgeting it. It's really mostly signed leases that commence later this year that drive that growth and on top of that, you're comping a period where we were getting back some blockbuster and border space in the back half of last year, so I think it's very strong results forecasted based on visible leasing, as well as a period where we did take a little bit of a hit late in fourth quarter. You saw that go into the first quarter, and we comfortably expect an acceleration in same-store NOI as we look out over the rest of the year.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: If I just kind of stay on the leasing side and look at your disclosure by size, you continue to make progress on the small shops and there was 70-basis-point improvement on the under 2,500, but then it kind of went back a little bit on the 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. It sounds like you're pretty constructive on kind of based on what you see regaining that momentum, but is there any specific in terms of that you mentioned maybe Blockbuster maybe rolled into the first quarter as well? But in terms of the 5,000 to 20,000 square feet, anything noteworthy there in terms of the 50-basis-point or so decline? And then on the small shops, is it too early to say that Set Up Shop could be doing anything for the small guys?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, let me start with the smallest side, Paul, it's been a real focus obviously of ours and some of our peers at 2,500 and less. And Set Up Shop, while it's not moving the needle. It certainly has some positive. We've been pleasantly surprised, we probably have about 15 deals signed or close to being signed in less than only 2 months of this initiative. It really has been a pleasant surprise. And we're going to move on, and as we've announced recently, we're going to roll it out in Florida. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but if there's 15 deals done in Atlanta, we only identified about 100 specific spaces for the program, so immediately, we're picking up on our recovery rate in those centers. And hopefully as we continue to work with the new tenants and establish their business, we're going to have some long-term play at that some significantly higher rents, but that's not the entire story behind the improvement in the 2,500. Consolidation of shop space is a big deal, and that really has been more of an impact on that smallest space versus the 5 to 10 or even the 5 to 20. Since 2010, I think we've been there and we have this in our investor presentation about 100 -- 300 units, almost 800,000 square feet that we have combined to larger units with players like Ulta and Shoe Carnival and Kirkland's and Carter's. So that's all good news. And we'll continue to -- I look at the first quarter in terms of the 5 to 20 as a -- where that declines rather lowest square footage improved, it's just a blood. That space will come back. Again, we're just focused on the small shop space. They've been the big beneficiary of the consolidation, whether it's expanding existing units or combining 3 units into one tenant, such as PetSmart. But again, it's a real focus of ours and we're pleased with the improvements today.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It might be worth taking a look, we do have a revised investor presentation online. And there is -- we do discuss at length on Page 34 where we talked about small shop absorption and what's happening in the portfolio, and on Page 49, we talked about small shop consolidation. And it's really what Paul was talking about. So while the absorption rate continues to improve, so move-ins are exceeding move-outs fairly dramatically, and that is something that didn't occur, obviously, in the last couple of years, and we've also started to materially impact the portfolio from a consolidation perspective. So if you go to the investor presentation that we have on our website, those 2 sections I think are pretty illustrative of what we're seeing in the market.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: I just had a quick question. Hopefully, you could provide some color on breaking out the releasing spreads and the same-property NOIs for the U.S. and Brazilian portfolios.
Paul W. Freddo: Yes on the same-store NOI, I think we wanted to be responsive to feedback we got regarding not just the internal way that the operating platform here looks at all the assets is the same, so look at 100% view. We wanted to make sure we were addressing what the investment community thought was most valuable, so we have added for good amount of disclosure on a pro rata operating stats and so what we disclosed was that at 100% same-store NOI was 2.9%; on a pro rata basis looking at our economic ownership interest in all the assets, it was 2.3%; and if we dissect that number between domestic and Brazil, Brazil was still by far the highest at around 9%; domestic same-store NOI growth was around 2% for the quarter. On leasing spread, there hasn't been that much of a difference between the 2, whether you're looking back or on a forecast basis looking forward, largely because while the growth overall has been higher in Brazil, a lot of that is captured through more significant annual rental bumps, and so they really seem spread in Brazil have not been meaningfully different than domestically. Certain quarters they've been higher, certain quarters they've been lower. In general, they've probably been slightly higher, but not a material difference there just because so much has picked up from the annual bumps, and so the end of the lease isn't as meaningful down there for the releasing spread. And also on the renewal and new deal spreads, the difference with a pro rata, it's important to note that point up a strength of the wholly-owned portfolio and that's one of the reasons we're showing this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: I'm on with Jordan Sadler as well. Dan, I appreciate your comments at the -- in your prepared remarks about the merchandising of retailers, and I was just wondering how do you underwrite or evaluate that view with your decisions to sign leases today, should we read into that, that DDR has become more selective with regard to signing leases with new tenants? And then also, how do you sort of view new leases versus renewals with all that in mind? Can you elaborate on that a bit?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Sure, Todd. It's a great question. And we have become more selective because we paid a price. We've made some mistakes down the line, primarily not in leases that we wrote ourselves. But on the acquisition side, really not being critical enough of some of the leases that were on in assets that we acquired when we didn't have great faith in some of the merchandising strategy and some of the retailers that we paid full price for, and that's something that we are being very careful, not just in who we sign leases with, but how we're evaluating acquisition opportunities as well. The way we mitigate that really is by spending a lot of time with the tenants and, not just meeting with real estate department, but are often meeting with merchants or talking with the financial folks about what their business plan and their business model is. But retail is an incredibly treacherous business because really it is a voracious consumer of capital and if you're wrong, if you miss in any given season or in some cases with some of the tenants that are out there, you miss in multiple quarters over several years, it absolutely devours your cash situation. And so while there are many tenants out there that have very little debt and have lots of cash, that can go away very quickly if you're wrong and if you're repeatedly wrong. So we have to be very, very sensitive to it. We have -- fortunately, we have a number of people in this company, starting at the Vice President level, on-off that has spent a lot of time working for retailers. And I think that gives us an advantage because when we walk through a store, we understand what to look for. And I think we also understand what questions to ask when we meet with retailers, we can get a good feel for what the strategy is. There are clearly tenants that we're not anxious to do business with and it's not because they're not great people, it's not because they don't have beautiful stores, it's because we're not so sure how sustainable the business model is based on what we see when we tour the stores and that is something that we discuss on a regular basis. So it comes up, it comes up in conversation, we have become much more selective. As our occupancy rate goes up, you become even more selective because you have the opportunity to do so. And I don't see any reason why that won't continue based on the leasing trends that we see.
David John Oakes: The selectivity is also another positive dividend from the philosophical change from an FFO per share focused company to a net asset value per share focused company. And if you don't have that philosophy right at the top, it's going to drive every little decision, whether you think they'd be tied into seniormost level philosophy or not. And I'll tell you in the past, when you're underwriting, who is going to contribute the most to FFO per share next year. You cared less about how much capital you might be putting into a suboptimal tenant, you cared less about credit quality and you cared more about what that day one headline rent was going to be. And at this point, when we're saying the goal is what makes this portfolio as valuable as possible over time with a relatively low risk profile, it means let's be very cautious about putting capital into deals with tenants we don't feel great about and it also means someone paying you a little less today but its cash flow stream might be valued at a higher multiple or lower cap rate could be very important for us, and so you see that philosophy coming down and driving that selectivity also.
Paul W. Freddo: I think it's worth pointing out just one example to what both Dan and David were talking about, where we had an existing tenant replace For Your Entertainment, FYE, in 2 centers, current on their rent, with a lot of term and we had the ability to do 2 [indiscernible] deals. That's the position we're in now with the prime assets where we could terminate and achieve little bit of a fee from FYE and put in a much, much stronger long-term player index.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Carol Kemple with Hilliard Lyons.
Carol L. Kemple: In your results, when you talk about at a 100% ownership, is that assuming that everything in a joint venture, you all own 100%? Or what's kind of difference between that and a pro rata basis?
David John Oakes: Yes, that's exactly right, Carol. And historically, I think because the internal focus and the way that our operating departments look at it, it is we own this entire portfolio, we are responsible for leasing and managing this entire portfolio. And so internally, to make sure that our people are just as focused, that we do share a duty we have on behalf of a partner even if DDR only owns 10% or the greater financial impact of that on our results, we own 100%. From an Investor Relations and accounting standpoint, we've got to be focused on the pro rata figures in terms of what has been the most economic impact. But the reality is, individual leasing professionals are working their hardest to lease all of our assets and in many cases, aren't even exactly aware of how something is owned. And so for us, we had historically reported everything on a 100% basis simply because internally that is how the operating department look at it, but have certainly wanted to respond to feedback we've gotten over the past year about the value of pro rata statistics and so that's why we've added that disclosure. So the numbers comparable to prior periods are the at 100%, the pro rata disclosures is something we added this quarter and that we will keep going on a go-forward basis.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's also important to note that some of the numbers when you look at it on a pro rata basis are somewhat surprising. One of the things I think many people assume was that you didn't do pro rata because the numbers would have been inferior if you did it on a consolidated basis. But if you really look at the numbers and you go back to what Paul said during his script, for the first quarter, new deals were executed at a 6% rental increase, but on a pro rata basis the spread was at 9% rental increase. So actually the whole young portfolio in many respects is performing at a higher-level than some of the other assets that we had in joint venture. So I think that's -- there's some very good news to be had when looking at it both from a consolidated and a pro rata basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: Just thinking about some of the lease stats where you have the noncomparable space. It's been give or take 20% to 25% of total leasing, just under 5% of the total portfolio of the last 12 to 18 months. And I'm just curious sort of what impact -- because you don't give the spreads, but what sort of impact has that had on sort of underlying same-store NOI in terms of the growth of the business? And then just, David, can you just clarify just -- I know we're dealing with decimal points, but U.S. you said was about 2%, is it -- can you just give the -- is it 1.5%? Is it 1.7%? Is it 2.2%? And does it include Puerto Rico? And if we could get the disclosure on a country basis going forward so I don't have to ask it on the call, that would be helpful as well.
David John Oakes: Sure, Michael a couple things. One, for just domestic U.S. consolidated assets, the same-store NOI growth was exactly 2%. Puerto Rico this quarter happened to be slightly lower than that, and so including Puerto Rico with that hybrid domestic, you'd be slightly below 2% at 1.9% for the consolidated domestic portfolio with Puerto Rico included. And so, we're happy to give more information there. One of the challenges is, of course, Sonae Sierra Brasil, is a public company at this point. Sonae Sierra Brasil has not reported their first quarter earnings and they are traditionally on a period that is slightly after ours. And so there are some stats that just because they are a public company with other shareholders, that were simply not going to be able to give in this great detail and that are going to have to come out of the detailed disclosure that they provide. The one thing that I'll say about the leasing split between comparable and noncomparable is just a nomenclature issue. That is not meant to be what's defined in our same-store. So our same-store relates to which assets haven't changed, don't have redevelopment activity, and have been owned for the requisite period of time. It's not simply a comparable, noncomparable being defined as what's in same-store NOI and what's not in same-store NOI. A large portion of that noncomparable could be in same-store NOI, it's just the space has been changed. In one way or another, it could be in some cases, assets that we acquired from England or someone else where they just haven't been leased, and that's a period of time where we simply don't have comparable information, and so it's not meant to be some secret number that we have, that we go out of our way to disclose. There isn't a comparable calculation that would make any sense to disclose there, and so I think that's why we've consistently pointed people to the renewal spread as a much more legitimate economic indicator. But what's going on with rental rates, we provide the disclosure on new leasing, but did want to make sure you have that distinction. The comparable versus noncomparable as defined here is not consistent with same-store versus non-same-store. It could be a lot of different reasons that it gets into that other bucket.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And the other reason why renewal rates are the right indicator and a good fuel for what's happening in the portfolio is because it makes something in any given quarter between 70% and 80% of the total deal volume that occurs. So when you're putting up the numbers that we're putting up and you have real good numbers on 70% to 80% of that, it really is the indicator of what's happening in the portfolio. That's why you see such a wide variety of new deal spreads throughout the industry because some folks do a lot of deals that are new, and some people do 5 deals a quarter that our new. And it has a huge impact on what the actual spread is. So we're very focused. As Paul mentioned in the script, we're very focused on the renewals and we think that, that's a good leading indicator on the health of the portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with UBS.
Christy McElroy: And following up on the renewal rates discussion, you talked about leasing spreads being sustainable in the mid- to high single digits. And just looking at your lease expirations schedule, for the less than 10,000 square-foot space, it seems like the average expiring rent for 2012 is much higher at about $30 a foot than the portfolio average. Is there something sort of weird there going on in terms of the space mix? Or should we be worried at all about spreads narrowing on that space this year?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, there is. There is something -- that's a Brazil story, Christy. There's some centers turning on their 10-year term on it, so we're seeing a high percentage of renewals in the Brazil portfolio. And that's really what's driving that less than 10,000 square foot base rent number up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: Dan, I think you mentioned the 2013 to 2014 open-to-buys and rent, is there any chance this can lead to more redevelopment and possibly improve non-prime assets to the point where it's prime again?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, I think it will. I think that's exactly right, Rich. We are seeing a situations now where projects are coming up on the redevelopment platform and we are converting some of the assets from non-prime to prime as a result of tenant interest. And I think that will increase as folks come to the realization that development is not going to accelerate dramatically anytime soon. And I do think, though, when you go to Vegas and you walk around, you will see a lot of development projects that are being presented. Many more I think this year than you've seen in past years, but I'm not so sure they get built. So I do think the opportunity and what you have, the space that you have going forward should be worth more to tenants. And it will prompt, I think, expansion of the redevelopment, if not acceleration of the redevelopment program. I think it's going to be very, very necessary for the tenants to look at redevelopment opportunities, to look at prototype size, to increase their flexibility, to look at even new concepts, Rich, because many of these concepts are there. And the opportunities to enter into markets may not be at the existing price point, it might be with new merchandise at a different price point. I think we're going to a fascinating period of time where over the next 2 or 3 years, we're going to see the retail business evolve in a way that's going to be very, very exciting, and that's why we spent, like I mentioned earlier, so much time with the tenants because you never get the same answer twice. There's a lot of things happening that's moving very, very quickly and we need to stay in front of it. Redevelopment is something that I think will continue to be prominent. And I know a lot of folks are talking about it and many of our peers are doing a great job with it. I wouldn't be surprised if it accelerated even further.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: I figure I'd give it one more shot. Where I was going with the non-comp space was just given that it's -- in the last 15 months is 3.3 million square feet, and I fully recognize that renewals is almost 8 million square feet over the last 15 months and that's even well over 10% of the portfolio. But I'm just trying to get a handle on this 3.3 million square feet that's been leased over the last 15 months, it's almost 5% of the portfolio. What was underlying -- how were those leases affecting 2012? Is it a substantial contributor? Or is it more of a downsize opportunities where rent on a basis is coming down? Just to really understand what that impact is on the financials.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It's a substantial contributor, Mike. And downsizing opportunities do not mean rent is coming down, by the way. In many cases, it means rent is going up. And there's some good examples of that in the investor presentation that's online. So the assumption that the rent is coming down on the downsize, particularly in the prime asset, where you're not in a distress situation, you're going to see rents go up, it's an opportunity to mark-to-market. So that's why we like downsizing, that's why we're pushing for downsizing. The new deals, they're a substantial contributor because they were vacant for the most parts. And when those numbers come online, it usually takes more than a year to see the full contribution, if that's really sort of your question. Because as you know, most of our tenants don't open at any time during the year. And whenever we do deals, we're lucky if we get a partial year in the year that they open. And then you have to wait until the next year to get the full year. So the contribution for the year in which the deal is done sometimes is 0, sometimes it's minimal, but it's significant the following full year that you get the impact of the rent. And that's why you're seeing the same sort of NOI in the portfolio go up over historical averages even though the leasing velocity has been great, the benefit for 2012 is really for deals that were done in 2011 and some actually that were done in 2010, but you don't get the full year benefit until 2012. Same thing is going happen in '11, for 2013, and same thing will happen in 2014 for the deals that are being done in 2012. So the contribution is significant. We're not giving rent away. The basis in those space is usually 0 because they've been vacant for an extended period of time and are consolidated deals and downsizing. The truth is, we don't have to do them if we don't make money, and we're not doing them if we don't make money and if it's not positive to the overall NOI growth at the asset level.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to the DDR management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you very much for joining us, and we look forward to touching base with you at the end of the next quarter. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful call -- have a wonderful day."
17,SITC,2,2012,2012-08-01 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 DDR Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chanel, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. As we navigate through the slow summer months of the retail environment, with the overhang of our presidential election adding uncertainty in the market, we, at DDR, find ourselves in a position of strength with tremendous opportunity. June retail sales results were below expectations for most retailers, but not for all, and most importantly, not for many of our key tenants. Off-price retailers and discount stores grabbed profitable market share, with sales results beating expectations and earnings guidance revised upwardly. Moreover, store opening plans for our retail partners were generally maintained or raised, and the secular negative trend in the traditional grocery business, most recently highlighted by the SUPERVALU situation, will continue to benefit our prime portfolio in the long-term. From a capital markets perspective, we've made further progress with our balance sheet by opportunistically accessing the unsecured market and, most recently, the preferred market at very attractive rates, resulting in a lower cost of capital and an improved maturity profile. With regard to our capital recycling and portfolio management activities, we continue to prune the portfolio of nonprime assets and weak retailers and source acquisitions of prime power centers, while simultaneously simplifying our story. The quality of our portfolio and the credit quality of our cash flows have never been better, and the outlook for continued improvement is encouraging. Overall, we are very pleased with the consistency of our operating results and the performance of our platform, the sales results and the market share gains of our key retailers, the continued success of our capital recycling program and the continued improvement in our balance sheet to the execution of our capital markets strategy. While our progress has been steady and consistent, we are constantly reminded of our surroundings and, specifically, the concerns of the market most recently regarding an economic slowdown. The questions we've been hearing indicate a market searching for clarity regarding the growth outlook for our retailers, the propensity for consumers to continue spending and how this translates to the real estate portion of the equation. Given the various moving pieces, it is important to note that retailers make domestic real estate decisions based on sales and profit forecasts and their cost and access to capital, which remains very strong, as opposed to any particular election cycle or events in Europe. We continue to work with our retailers to meet their growth aspirations in a supply-constrained environment, and there has been no indication of a slowdown. In terms of the consumer, we don't have to guess where they are shopping and spending their money on everyday products. Ready-to-wear is being purchased at off-price retailers that offer branded and private label goods at a discount price, as the vast majority of consumers seek bargains and promotional pricing presented in a simple manner. One only needs to look at the recent results of J. C. Penney and the recently-announced pricing policy adjustment to confirm this fact. Groceries are being purchased at large discount stores, warehouse clubs and specialty grocers. Consumers in this economic environment more than ever demand value and convenience as they look to maximize their dollar. This plays to our strength. While there is certainly reason for us to be mindful and cautious of the macro environment in which we currently operate, there is no good reason to be negative now or in the foreseeable future, particularly based on the sales and profitability of our retail partners and the visibility of our property level cash flows. Please remember, leases are executed well in advance of projected openings in our guidance, which includes continued same-store NOI growth in Q3 and Q4, accounts for those contractual obligations. Before turning the call over to Paul, I would like to address the effectuation of a strategic objective at our company as it relates to our development pipeline and the disclosure you likely reviewed in our supplemental after our earnings release last night. During the second quarter, we made a $20 million investment in a fully entitled and 100% leased development site in Charlotte, North Carolina. The project, known as Belgate, is nearly a 900,000 square foot power center that features an IKEA, Walmart Supercenter and a 170,000 square feet of junior anchor space. This is the only IKEA between Atlanta and Washington D.C., which makes us a truly unique regional site. The project is expected to fully open in spring 2013. Belgate represents an innovative approach to meeting the growth aspirations of our retail partners without assuming the risk associated with traditional development. As you've heard us mention since the formulation of our strategic plan, our development strategy has been to monetize our existing land, which is well underway, and find new projects that enable us to leverage our platform and present upsized returns without assuming standard or historical development risks. While we have reviewed many projects over the past few years, we were consistently unenthused with the offerings. Belgate, however, represents one of the few opportunities to make an investment in a development project that has certainty of execution and that will realize development-like returns without taking traditional development risk. We anticipate that our cash-on-cost unlevered yield for this project will comfortably exceed 10%. The criteria for these investments have been fully entitled with verifiable tenant demand, no major due diligence items outstanding and appropriate risk-adjusted unlevered cash-on-cost yield make projects like Bellgate very difficult to find. Bellgate, however, meets the qualifications, and we are very pleased with this opportunity to build another prime asset and add this to our portfolio. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. As evidenced by another quarter of high leasing production, we continue to see strong demand for space in our portfolio. A combination of continuing growth from market share winning retailers and limited new supply is resulting in competition for space and positive trends in terms of occupancy gains and leasing spreads. During the second quarter, we executed 200 new deals for 900,000 square feet at a spread of 10.7%. We also executed 226 renewals for 1.8 million square feet at a spread of 6.1%, our highest renewal spread in 15 quarters. Combined spreads were up 6.8% overall, but more significantly, up 8.3% on a pro rata basis. Before diving deeper into what we're seeing in terms of retailer demand and growth strategies, I want to point out the impact of the 46 assets acquired in the Blackstone joint venture on our leased rate for the second quarter and year end expectations. Excluding the 46 assets that were acquired on June 20, we improved our leased rate to 94.1% as of the end of the second quarter, a 40 basis point increase sequentially and a 110 basis point increase over second quarter 2011. Including the 46 acquired assets, the leased rate at the end of the second quarter was 93.7%. Accordingly, while we are still very comfortable with our previously guided leased rate for 2012 of over 94.5% absent the newly acquired Blackstone JV. When included, our annual expectation becomes approximately 94.1% due to the lower overall leased rate of that specific portfolio. While the Blackstone JV portfolio puts short-term pressure on the overall leased rate, the good news is the portfolio consists primarily of high-quality power centers that were previously undercapitalized. As a result of the recapitalization of the venture, we expect to realize the organic growth opportunity in this portfolio, which will positively impact our numbers at the property level NOI and leasing fee line items going forward. But regardless of the moving pieces, leasing is strong, occupancy continues to increase, spreads are growing, and our portfolio remains in very high demand. Regardless of the speculation that near-term economic uncertainty may lead to a deceleration of store growth, and so far, that's all it is -- speculation. The fact remains that quality retailers have strong financial positions and maintain aggressive open-to-buys. Best-in-class retailers with strong brand recognition and competitive merchandising strategies will continue to grow market share through a variety of strategies, including entering new markets, developing new concepts and prototypes and acquiring other retailers. Growing market share by entering new markets and expanding geographic presence is a traditional method of new store expansion. We've already announced the successful launch of Anna's Linens and Shoe Carnival into Puerto Rico where they joined other domestic retailers such as PetSmart, T.J. Maxx and Burlington Coat Factory that have expanded on to the island in the past few years. More recently, we entered into 2 new deals with Dick's Sporting Goods as part of their first wave of stores in Salt Lake City. We have facilitated Ross's entry into new markets with 2 of their initial stores in Chicago and 1 of their initial stores in St. Louis, with other opportunities in the pipeline. Other examples of retailers looking to enter new markets include Publix expanding into Tennessee; Kirkland's, to New Jersey; Trader Joe's, to Colorado; and Walmart expanding their neighborhood market concept across the country. While not market-specific, Whole Foods has indicated they will absolutely need to enter new markets across the country to hit their growth projections, and we are working very closely with them to help facilitate their strategy. A timely example of a growing retailer entering new markets in an aggressive way is Five Below. As the largest landlord to Five Below, we have helped them enter several new markets and, most recently, completed 5 deals for their initial stores in Atlanta. Notably, 2 of these stores were created through small shops consolidation, and the other 3 locations were the result of filling residuals base from downsized Old Navy, Jo-Ann and Office Depot boxes at substantial rent gains. The residual space resulting from these downsizings is 100% leased, and we increased the rent per square foot by an average of 65%. The initial results of the Five Below IPO highlight the confidence investors have in their business model, and it should not be overlooked that every one of their 60-plus stores planned for 2013 will be in power centers. Tilly's is another example of a retailer with a recent [Audio Gap] taking their concept nationwide, with 45 new stores planned for 2013. This action sports retailer has adapted its merchandise mix to one with nationally strong surf, skate and motocross brands, and they view power centers as their primary focus for new stores. We recently facilitated their entry into the Columbus, Ohio market, and we have several more deals across the country in the pipeline. Another dynamic we are seeing is traditional mall retailers, particularly fashion retailers, looking to grow in the power center format. One example is Gap with their factory stores. Our first factory store location recently opened in Boston in a downsized Old Navy. And we're actively working with Gap on several other Gap and Banana Republic factory store locations. Kirkland's is a retailer that made a strategic shift away from malls a few years ago, and as a result, we're up to 11 locations with them. Lane Bryant, Torrid, Carter's, Crazy 8 and Aeropostale are also example of traditional mall retailers expanding their store base in power centers and with whom we have completed recent deals. Frequency of shopping trips and dramatically reduced occupancy costs, which leads to superior operating margin, are the 2 factors most often cited as the drivers behind the retailers' decision to focus on power centers. In addition to entering new markets and in response to clear consumer preference, many retailers are growing by developing new concepts or accelerating expansion of their loft [ph] priced brands. An example of this is Bloomingdale's Outlet, which we've recently worked with to facilitate their entry into the Chicago market. Another concept which is growing aggressively is Nordstrom Rack, whom we now have opened in 5 of our centers and recently finalized the sixth deal as we facilitate their entry into Columbus. Other new concepts include Field & Stream and True Runner by Dick's Sporting Goods, Sports Editions [ph] by Hibbett Sports, Steel [ph] by Save Stores [ph] and Forever 21's 20,000 square foot concept. These new concepts are being introduced by established, well-funded existing retailers with proven and successful track record that have spent significant capital to test these concepts, know their customer and merchandise accordingly. In a limited new supply and low cost of capital environment, another growth avenue for retailers is through the acquisition of other retailers. The recent acquisition of Cost Plus World Market by Bed Bath & Beyond and Ascena's acquisition of Charming Shoppes are 2 great examples of strong credit quality retailers capitalizing on this opportunity. Given that their previous unimpressive financial standing precluded them from being candidates for growth, we had both Cost Plus and Charming Shoppes on our tenant watch list. They represented a combined 70 basis points of our pro rata annual base rent. But now with strong credit and proven merchants overseeing these operations, we have removed them from our watch list as they have healthier overall balance sheets, improved operational strategies and new and exciting expansion plans. To that point, we're in the process of finalizing 2 deals with Cost Plus as Bed Bath & Beyond is clearly looking to take advantage of this concept's growth potential. Both of these deals were previously on our hold list. In summary, successful retailers are not discouraged by macroeconomic news. In fact, many view volatility as an opportunity to propel growth and expand market share. When you combine that desire for growth, the financial strength of our key tenants, the preference for power centers by the retailers' dominating market share gains, the improving credit quality of cash flow in the vastly improved quality of our portfolio as endorsed by our leasing activity and overall tenant performance. We are very excited about these trends. Then, adding the lack of new supply into the equation makes me very confident that we will continue to generate solid operational improvement for the foreseeable future. And I'll now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $71.6 million or $0.25 per share for the second quarter, slightly ahead of our plan. Including nonoperating items, FFO for the quarter was $6.5 million higher at $78.1 million or $0.27 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily net gains resulting from our aggressive capital recycling program, offset somewhat by losses related to repurchase of $34 million of our 9.625% notes due in 2016. Operating FFO per share was 9% above 2011, clearly indicating that our operating performance is now flowing to the bottom line. We were able to achieve attractive pricing on new debt, which allowed us to accomplish a significant amount of refinancing that will positively impact our earnings and fixed charge coverage ratio in the coming quarters. Perhaps most importantly, the weighted average maturity of these new financings is 6.3 years, and as a result, our consolidated debt duration at June 30 was approximately 5 years, the longest in the company's history and a significant improvement from 2.9 years at the end of 2009. Subsequent to quarter end, we issued $200 million of 6.5% redeemable Class J preferred shares to fund the redemption of the 7.5% Class I preferred shares. The new shares are callable in 5 years, and the annual fixed charge savings are $1.7 million. Midway through the year we have substantially addressed all of our 2012 debt maturities. Our $300 million bond offering in June funded the repayment of the $223 million of unsecured notes due in October and reduced borrowings on the line of credit. In addition, we addressed the majority of our 2012 unconsolidated debt maturities primarily through the 5-year refinancing for the 2 large debt facilities in our TIAA-CREF joint venture amounting to approximately $700 million. Remaining 2012 consolidated debt maturities consists of $13 million of mortgage debt, and our share of remaining unconsolidated maturities is $107 million. We expect to refinance these loans at attractive terms, and we also have about 80% capacity on our $815 million revolving credit facilities today. Further, DDR has no remaining unsecured consolidated debt maturities for nearly 3 years and has made considerable progress on refinancing 2013's secured maturities and adding prime assets to the unencumbered pool, which we expect to finalize in the coming months. Today, we are absolutely prepared to withstand volatile capital markets. In addition, having less debt and longer-term -- and a longer-term more balanced debt profile, our exposure to variable rate debt has declined considerably. Variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt stood at 9% at the end of June compared to 29% at the end of 2009. While we have made considerable progress in lowering the company's risk profile over the past 2.5 years, we acknowledge that there's more work to do. DDR remains absolutely committed to continuing to lower leverage and aggressively pursuing additional investment grade ratings. The operating environment remains favorable to retail REITs of scale with high-quality operating platforms, and combined with redevelopment initiatives coming online, further monetization of our land bank and our above-average retention of free cash flow, we project that our debt-to-EBITDA will continue to decline. We continue to strengthen the quality of our portfolio with our sector-leading capital recycling program. During the first half of the year, proceeds from nonprime asset sales were $126 million, and an additional $26 million of fully owned assets are currently under contract for sale. Nonprime properties sold during the first half of 2012 have average trade area household incomes of $63,000, 21% below DDR's prime portfolio, and an average trade area population of 173,000 people, 46% below DDR's prime portfolio. Net proceeds from asset sales combined with common equity issued through our ATM program were used to fund the acquisitions of 3 very high-quality large-format prime power centers: Brookside Marketplace in Chicago, Tanasbourne Town Center in Portland and the Arrowhead Crossing in Phoenix. These properties have average lease rates of 95%, average trade area household incomes of $81,000 and average trade area populations of over 500,000 people. Further, we believe that there are opportunities to leverage our operating platform to create incremental value at these assets, each of which has been added to our large and growing unencumbered pool. Subsequent to quarter end, we acquired our partner's 50% ownership interest in Ahwatukee Foothills Towne Center, a 675,000 square foot prime power center located in Phoenix, Arizona. DDR has managed this property for 15 years. The shopping center is over 94% leased, has average trade area household income of over $80,000 on average and average trade area population of over 500,000 people and is anchored by Sprouts, AMC, Ross, PETCO and Jo-Ann. We are also in the process of completing the acquisition of Tucson Spectrum, a large-format prime shopping center in Tucson, Arizona, anchored by Target, Home Depot, Food City, Ross, Marshalls, J. C. Penney, Sports Authority and Bed Bath & Beyond. The combined purchase price of these acquisitions is $200 million, and we expect to capitalize these transactions consistent with recent acquisitions as we deploy asset sales and equity raised earlier this year and further improve the size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool. In reviewing the second quarter performance and looking forward, it is important to recognize that our sale of nonprime assets and redeployment of capital in the prime centers is making our operations much more efficient, and we believe these improvements are sustainable. While the initial impact of portfolio improvements is expected to be higher rental growth, it is also worth noting that nonrecoverable operating expenses decreased, bad debt continues to decrease and recurring capital expenditures should decrease. All of which improve our profitability and ability to grow net asset value. With 2 quarters now in the books, we are reiterating our 2012 operating FFO per share guidance of $1 to $1.04, which we raised in May. However, the components have changed as balance sheet improvement has accelerated, which comes at a short-term cost despite the long-term benefit, and the Brazilian currency has depreciated well beyond our original budget. Importantly, on the other hand, internal growth has been stronger than expected, and we now expect 2012 same-store NOI growth to be at least 3%, up from the initial guidance of 2% to 3%. The drop in the Brazilian real has hurt our FFO per share by about $0.005 in the first half of this year, and we expect the impact to be about $0.01 for the full year. Accelerated refinancings will also take another $0.005 from 2012 FFO per share. Despite all of these changes, we are pleased to reiterate FFO guidance and believe that our recent actions position us even more strongly for FFO and NAV growth in the future. 2012 will mark the first year of FFO per share growth in the past 5 years, and we believe that we are well prepared to generate multiple years of FFO and more importantly, EBITDA and NAV growth to come. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to thank those of you that have recently participated in our perception study. It has been 2 years since we last surveyed the market for feedback on strategy and communications with investors and analysts, and we greatly appreciate the candid feedback you provided us once again. We listened to your comments from the past, and many of those suggestions influenced our strategic plan, which we are now executing. We will certainly listen again, and I'm confident your ideas will continue to help make us a better company going forward. Your opinions are valued and your judgment of our company is not taken lightly. At this point, we'd be happy to turn the call over to questions, operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Morgan.
Paul Morgan: Just on the land bank and your kind of efforts to monetize that. I mean, could you just talk about any movements there and whether some of the improvements we've had in the housing market could bring some of these efforts either on your behalf or on third-party interest kind of back to life, and what kind of pipeline we see for making progress there?
Paul W. Freddo: Paul, this is Paul. We've been making progress. Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, we've clearly seen some progress in our land bank, and if you look in the supp [ph] even with the Belgate acquisition, we're going to be net sellers of land for 2012. And we are looking at everything, with deals we're making whether it's with department stores for pads or parts of a parcel or for residential, we look at all of that. But we are seeing some progress, and we'll continue to see some progress. And that is what's reflected in the number you see in the supplement. We're going to be net sellers of land even with an acquisition in 2012.
David John Oakes: Yes. Although, the frustrating part last year was we were talking a lot about our goal of making progress on land sales, but you were seeing very little of it show up in the transactional results, and you were seeing even less of it show up in the income statement, and I think this year, you're certainly seeing more of that flow through. There's a conscious effort internally to focus on these nonproducing asset sales. And you've seen more of that come through, which importantly, not only generates the proceeds that can be used to reduce debt or reinvest in operating assets, but also as you might have noticed in the operating expenses this quarter, we also -- since we're not capitalizing expenses on most of that land, you also see the improvement in operating expenses, they come through when we sell this land. So it has been a major focus. You're starting to see more of it show-up and will see even more of that in coming quarters. To your specific point on is the housing market having a significant impact there, we're not necessarily seeing the single-family housing market have any direct impact there. But multifamily, as you know well, has continued to be extremely hot for new development, and there are some parcels of land where we would look at a higher and better use being non-retail.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: David, just going to the balance sheet for a second. You guys bought back your high coupon debt this quarter, paying a premium. I think in previous conversations, you've said that tendering and then reissuing that some of your other peers have done, you weren't as interested in. But given your activity year-to-date of paying a premium to buy back the 9.625s, would you consider just tendering for the whole thing, reissuing a new lower coupon, especially given the demand for corporate debt these days?
David John Oakes: Yes, we certainly consider everything in terms of balance sheet improvement and improving net fixed charge coverage ratio. I think what it comes down to for us is, does the economics of it make sense. Obviously, the premium that we're paying for the 2016 notes or any of our other paper is really just prepaying that future interest. And while you can show a charge 1 quarter and a better run rate going forward, the reality is oftentimes in these tender reissue scenarios, we haven't believed that there is a true economic benefit. For our open market repurchases happening dramatically inside of a make whole sort of price, we were generating a current yield on those purchases in the high-7s, but more importantly, a yield to maturity in the mid- to high-3s for the most part when we could issue longer duration debt that a yield to maturity as we did earlier this year through the term loan in the low- to mid-3s. So I think for us, it was a focus on, economically is there a benefit to tender or to repurchase and reissue, and we came away even though you could do it in smaller volumes. But the open market repurchase and reissue had an economic benefit to us where the tender could have created a better run rate, but only at the expense of all the prepaid interest we'd have to put up and the significantly greater premium that we'd have to pay for a tender, and so economically we didn't think that makes sense for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Just a question, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that the distress in the supermarket business and you mentioned SUPERVALU will benefit the prime portfolio in the long run. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, there's clearly a secular shift on where people are buying food. And the traditional grocer, which has often -- it was the opinion of many, was often invincible to competition because everyone had to eat has proven to be very vulnerable to new trends, new retailers, better merchandising and better formats. So while it is true that everyone does have to eat and everyone has to purchase food, they don't have to do it at a traditional grocer. And if you look at where the sales are going -- and it's right across the board. It's the formats that I mentioned, but it's also formats like dollar stores. Because they sell a lot of boxed goods and a lot of dried goods that are competing directly with traditional grocers as well. So we feel that the traditional grocer as it sits today is less dominant than it's been; specialty grocers, Cost Plus -- I mean, I'm sorry Costco and Sam's and warehouse clubs and supercenters and Target, et cetera are all grabbing market share. As you know, Walmart today is the largest grocer in the United States, and it wasn't not too long ago. So there's clearly a shift away from traditional grocers and going to alternative uses, and those are the alternative uses that populate our shopping centers. And for that reason, we feel that it will benefit us in the long run.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance, Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: When I look at the noncomparable leases on Page 32 and as part of your new leases budget, you do about twice as many noncomparable as comparable leases, but unfortunately, of course, we don't have anything when it comes to a re-leasing spread. Can you give us a sense of what those leases are in terms of the type of tenant you're able to attract for the boxes and the kind of quality of the properties that are included in here?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Cedrik, as we've talked about before, we do this count in the most conservative manner possible, which is that 1-year look, if you've been vacant for more than a year, it's not going to be in the calculation. But there are going to be other reasons that deals are not in the comp pool, whether it's a different type of deal, a consolidation of space, for example, would not be an accurate way to measure a spread. The -- you've got a significant portion of the vacancy in that category of space vacant more than a year. Then it involves varying qualities. If we look, in fact, one of the things we get because this is a question which comes up quite often. Look at if we included all of the deals in this calculation, again, it was obvious that we had a very strong new deals spread for this quarter. It would have been up over 32%, which obviously is not a true judge of market conditions and something we're not going to do. But there's space in there that's never been leased, it's first generation space, the space that we acquired in some centers which had never been occupied since we'd owned it. So it's a tremendous mix of space, but for obvious reasons, we're not going to include it. Another thing that I think is important we should look at that spread cap, as you know we're using the last rent versus the first rent. There's no straight-lining on our spreads. And again, that's a very, very conservative manner and way to look at the leasing spreads overall. Final thing I'd add is we keep coming back to -- if you want to understand where trends are and what's happening with the market, look at the renewal spread. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have the largest renewal spread in 15 quarters. That is a very, very big deal, and that's what we're seeing happening and that's also with the last rent, first rent no straight-lining of that activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas C. Truxillo: You guys have obviously made some good progress in reducing debt on your balance sheet and also lowering the cost of the capital. Can you provide any comments on what you think that your run rate fixed charge coverage is right now, given all the changes? And kind of where you see that going over the next 2 quarters with the EBITDA growth that you have baked into your guidance?
David John Oakes: Yes, it's a great question, Tom, because especially the way the proceeds from forward equity offering hits in very late June. We had the fixed charge impact of debt, but you didn't have the excess equity proceeds beyond the Blackstone investment show up. So I do think there's additional improvement built in. Obviously, the refinancing of the preferred equity leads to additional improvement, and so I think from a fixed charge perspective, a ratio that bottomed 2 years ago or 1.5 years ago in the high-1.6s to 1.7 area is up just north, a little north of 1.8x today, and I think we see a very visible path this year to get to 1.9, and in 2013 to get north of 2x, which we think is an important metric. It doesn't represent the end game. It doesn't mean that once we get to 2x that the progress stops, but I do think we see a very credible path from the 1.8 reported this quarter pro forma, that's for a few transactions get to 1.9, and then get to 2x next year. And so I think you'll continue to see progress on that metric.
Thomas C. Truxillo: Sure. And you guys -- part of the plan was to use some free cash flow to pay down debt. You've since increased the dividend a couple of times. Any comments on use of free cash flow that you generate now if you can increase the dividend again to kind of soak up some of that? Or if you see further opportunities to delever -- I know you don't have unsecured maturities coming due, but you do have some security you can always buy back like you have been.
David John Oakes: Yes, we -- despite the increased dividend, we still got by far I think the lowest payout ratio in the sector, and therefore, the highest free cash flow, it's being retained in the sector. And one way or another, every one of those dollars is going to improving our debt-to-EBITDA ratios. So a few years ago, you were seeing more of that go purely to debt paydown. Today, you're seeing some of that going to redevelopment spending or the acquisition of operating assets. So today, you're seeing probably more of it going to the creation of new recurring, growing and sustainable EBITDA rather than simply debt reduction. As exactly as you point out, there is less debt to be reduced. And so, you're seeing that free cash flow be redirected more often now to EBITDA increases, and I think you're going to see that show up in a more significant way in our results over the coming quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt, Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I hope you haven't been already touched on, but what do you think the volume of dispositions could be in the second half relative to what you were able to accomplish in the first half?
David John Oakes: This year, somewhat the same as last year. We took advantage of a market in the first half of the year that was stronger than expected. Last year, that paid off as it positioned us to not have to push on dispositions during an uncertain second half of the year. Second half of the year for 2012, also looking a little less certain, although we certainly haven't had any impact directly on transaction pricing. But I do think you saw us accelerate a few more dispositions to the first half of the year. It doesn't at all mean if we see the market hold up like this, that you'll see us slow that math process down. We'll continue to push. The improvement in portfolio quality is a massive continued focus for us. I think today, you're seeing a few more opportunities for us to redeploy that into the acquisition of new prime centers. And so, we're not scared to beat guidance on dispositions. And so, you could see another $100 million or so of dispositions hit in the second half of the year. They get redeployed in some of the high-quality acquisitions we've already identified or talked about. And we've already been sitting down to have meetings about 2013, how can we continue to sell nonprime assets and improve the portfolio quality. We're not stopping at that 90% prime metric. We want to continue to upgrade the portfolio quality and best position ourselves to own a portfolio. We can grow NAV [ph] the most overtime.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: One of the things that's also important about the dispositions, Craig, which inspires us to move forward with the program aggressively is we really saw this year at RECon the impact of the portfolio improvement, which is simply spending less time with retailers talking about bad assets and bad space and more time with retailers talking about prime assets and prime space. And that has brought a lot of creativity as you could see from the deal flow and the leasing spreads. It's improved our metrics. Our bad debt is down, as Dave mentioned in his script. Our operating margins are wider. It's just a -- it's a better business model today, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have been a significant capital recycler. In addition, there are those tenants out there, while we're not overly public about naming them specifically, there are those tenants out there that we are actively looking to reduce our exposure to. And we feel very comfortable that we're doing that for a good reason. As a result, as interest in certain asset with certain tenants surfaces, even though the asset may not be at the very top of our sale list, we certainly are considering it due to our desire to limit exposure to what we feel are tough credit tenants and our overall desire to improve the credit quality of our cash flows.
Operator: Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley, Citi.
Quentin Velleley: Just in the second half projections on the $403 million of ground-up development on hold, the negative $69 million, can you talk us through that? And then secondly, the growth impairments and not your share, I think there was about a total of $25 million of impairments on the land, can you also just talk us through what that was?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The -- Quentin, starting with the -- what's reflected in that $66 million reduction back half, those are deals by the way not included obviously, the back half deals. But negotiations, whether they are for outright sales of an entire parcel or with anchor stores for pads on sites. But I'm not in a position to give you the exact specifics, but that's obviously stuff we have in our budget because these deals are well underway.
David John Oakes: Yes. As we've talked about before the gestation period on these land sale was always longer, and so you've heard us talk about the progress there for a while. I think to see it show up in our budget for the second half of the year means we've got a much higher level of confidence with these longer processes. And longer due diligence periods are getting to a point where we should be able to execute on those and then show you that progress over the second half of the year even if those transactions take longer than a normal asset sale. We're getting closer to the period where we should be able to show you that. It's also as you referenced the tie-in to some of the impairments on the land, there have been some situations either due to lack of entitlement progress or lack of progress with the municipality or just the fact that we are revisiting some of our assumptions on what would be possible on some of these land sites and revisiting our thought process and where that capital can be better deployed. We have taken some impairments as we've lowered the probability that we do develop several of these sites and increasing instantly the probability that we sell them. And so your accounting -- your impairment tax changes at that time to put a greater emphasis on liquidation price rather than on discounted value of future cash flows. And so, that has triggered a few impairments there. Some of which, the largest I think for this quarter was a site that we got in the Inland transaction and a few others, were sites that we'd -- that we have acquired through other transactions. And so, I think you see a bit of that, but it's only a precursor to the progress that we're making in monetizing that, just an indication that, that immediate or near-term liquidation price is less than what GAAP requires you to do in terms of valuing the asset on the - on discounted future cash flows and an assumption that you're going to develop the site.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Donnelly, Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: A few of my questions have been answered, but I was curious for your take on direction of cap rates on A versus B assets, because I think there's something of a split view among your peers in terms of which segment just may be seeing greater relative improvement in the last quarter or so. What's your sense there? And I guess as a follow-up, from this point forward, do you think the fundamentals for NOI growth and valuation growth favor A versus B?
David John Oakes: We're seeing improvement across the board and in pricing. I think you still haven't seen a massive increase in transactional volume, but you have seen more and more transparency that would indicate that the pricing has moved higher cap rates, have moved to lower. Across the board, you get some incredible prints on coastal Class A centers and high-quality supply constrained markets going well below 6% cap rates at this point, when those used to be low 6s deals. But on the other side, you're also seeing B assets that have been in the high-7s, now in the low-7s or even at 7. The toughest of the Class B assets has seen less progress, but like you've seen improvement across the board in an environment where I think NOI growth is more credible. Debt is cheap, although not as available at sort of peak pricing periods in the past with a less reliable CMBS market today. But with cheap dept out there, as long as you're going to be sub-60% leverage, I think that supports pricing across all property types. When we look at where we see the greatest opportunity, the strongest unlevered IRRs on a go-forward basis, I do think it is going to be for the most part in the non-coastal Class A assets. So we believe that the premium being paid for some of the sub-6 transactions, it's hard to justify in rent growth over the coming years versus the opportunity for us, particularly in some of the partner transactions where we think we've gotten somewhat better than market pricing. For us to start out at a 7% cap rate and have extremely credible 2% to 3% if not higher growth and higher in some cases where there is a value-add component, but we think the visibility of a very attractive IRR is the greatest there when looking at those Class A assets, but not necessarily the trophy-caliber top 4 or 5 market, and that's where you've seen us put capital out, and I think it's safe to assume that if those top 20 to 40 markets where you'll continue to see us more likely to see opportunities because those opportunities are driven by the highest IRRs that we think are achievable.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's also very important, Jeff, that when you look at NOI growth and cash flows you look at them on a risk-adjusted basis, there are clearly opportunities in B and C assets where you can get significant NOI growth and value-add returns. But at the same time the stability of that cash flow is somewhat weak. The depth in the market, it could be a little shaky, and if you're a long-term holder that's a very different proposition than if you're a short-terms flipper. And because we are a long-term holder, we do feel that the NOI growth on a risk-adjusted basis and the operating fundamentals and A assets will exceed that of Bs and Cs on a risk-adjusted basis.
Operator: Our your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore, RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: Paul, you mentioned that some of the deals you have with a couple of retailers were on hold for various reasons. And I was wondering, is there any of that going on in the electronics, with hhgregg or RadioShack, and how do you guys feel about those 2 retailers in particular at this point?
Paul W. Freddo: Very differently by the way, between RadioShack and hhgregg, Rich, but yes, clearly, this is something we study, and you and I have talked about this. We are constantly watching all of our tenants and performance and categories. And obviously, when I was alluding to Cost Plus World Market as an example. We were not in a position whether they wanted a site or a new site or an existing asset. We were not going to make a deal given their current situation. Big change, obviously, with the Bed Bath & Beyond acquisition. We are in no hurry to make additional deals with an hhgregg right now. We talk to them all the time. We've made a number of deals over the last few years. We don't view them as any kind of immediate risk, but it is a category we will watch obviously as we do with Best Buy. RadioShack is a much different story, and RadioShack I'm glad you brought it up. And if something -- we've been watching these guys for a few years. I mean, we've continued to reduce in a very small way our exposure to RadioShack, and if something should happen more dramatic with RadioShack in the near future, we will not be unprepared on any of the locations. One of the interesting things is somewhere in the 40% range of our exposure on a pro rata basis is in Puerto Rico. And these locations absolutely cream their average sales per square foot of their domestic portfolio. So should there be stores to close, I'm quite confident those will be the last to close, and should they all close at some point in time, we are ready to release those debt as significant increases. So you look at a company like RadioShack, they have got to figure out themselves because there is no way we would do a new deal with them today. And in fact, we would go the other way, and we are prepared to replace where necessary.
Operator: You have a follow-up from the line of Alex Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Dan, just going to sales tax, the online sales tax discussion on your peer's call ahead of you guys, just curious your take if there is implemented a -- that online retailers are going to have to pay sales tax. Just your thoughts for the smaller fledgling retailers, sort of the next Charlotte Hobbs [ph] or next L.L.Bean-type retailers, do you think this could curtail their growth if they are now burdened with having to collect sales tax from all the various jurisdictions? Or you think it's pretty manageable for small up-and-coming retailers?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's very manageable for small up-and-coming retailers, and part of the analysis that has been done over time, Alex, is to survey a number of those folks through the various entities that are lobbying for a Main Street Fairness Act to see what the actual impact would be. And it's not something that most retailers, regardless of size, can't handle. It's something that has been consistently reviewed, and I really don't think that the impact would be that great. We have made great progress with Main Street Fairness, and we do expect something to happen in that regard, hopefully in the lame-duck session if not shortly thereafter. And I think all retailers today, regardless of whether they are Internet-based or bricks and mortar-based or omni-channel based, which we hope most retailers are at this point in time, are prepared for that. This is not going to be a surprise. This has been a long protracted discussion and a long protracted battle, and anyone who, quite frankly, isn't prepared to deal with the eventuality of a fairness tax, which is what this is, a fairness -- a leveling of the playing field, if you will. If you're not prepared for that you're really not paying attention to your business and you probably have bigger problems. So my feeling is that I don't think that this will catch anyone by surprise. I think people are well-prepared, and I don't think it will have really a negative impact on retailers at any level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa, ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa: Dan, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about Amazon. Obviously, kind of relating to the last question, they are not willing to start collecting sales tax, but they're clearly building a lot more DCs across the country, at least that sort of seems to be their plan, and maybe eventually, moving kind of broad-based to kind of same-day delivery. And I'm just wondering how you sort of think about the proposition that they're offering the customer. Obviously, people have to start paying tax, but they've now got convenience [ph] and how do you think that changes the landscape over the next decade?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, it's a great question, Steve, and I've great respect for Amazon. I'm not quite sure why they're valued, where they're valued, and I'm not quite sure why they're not obligated to make money like every other retailer is. And I think if they're held by this -- to the same standard as most every other retailer out there, obviously, people would be looking at them very differently. They would probably be on some sort of watch list, quite frankly, if you're looking at a less than 1% operating margin on sales of their size. I fully understand the need to invest in the future, and I fully understand the need for their CapEx, which is obviously, as you referenced, growing at a pretty dramatic rate. I get it. And I understand that they're building for the future, but at a company that does over $60 billion in sales, my question is, when is the future? If the future is -- was the future at -- is it at $100 billion, was it at $20 billion? Was -- is it $60 billion? So I think at some point in time, Amazon -- the model has to show that it can make money, and it hasn't done that yet. If you listened to their call last week, they kind of downplayed the same-day delivery notion a little bit. It got played out much more in the press than it did on their call, and I think -- I thought that was pretty surprising because that was something that everyone views as minimizing what's the competitive advantage for bricks and mortar, which is that you can pick things up and having some gratification, Amazon really can't provide you with that instant gratification. So I -- Amazon, it's an interesting case study. I think it gets a lot more attention than, quite frankly, it probably deserves. I think at some point in time, they'll be held but to the same standards as the rest of the retail. And when they're held to the same standards as the rest of retail, I think there's a real question whether the model works from a profitability standpoint. And while they continue to invest enormous sums of money in their business, and I think to grow market share, and I think that's a smart thing for them to do, I think that investment on the capital side is masking the fact that operating margin is beyond thin. And that's something that ultimately they're going to have to answer to, and I'm not so sure the model can answer to it as its currently constructed.
Operator: . And there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you all very much for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
18,SITC,3,2012,2012-11-02 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2012 DDR Corp.'s Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and Chief Financial Officer, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, as filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results highlight the continuation and execution of our strategic plan and the operational benefits of our investment and portfolio pieces. As you've heard me mention before, the great thing about our business is that we don't have to guess about who's winning or losing the attention of the consumer. As a result, we are not surprised that our retailers continue to gain market share, expand margins and aggressively seek new store opportunities, all of which continue to benefit our portfolio operations. Consistent with the various reports that have recently been published regarding the retail sector in general and power center tenants specifically, the vast majority of our retailers continue to experience market share gains in general merchandise, apparel, domestics and grocery sales. While there are certainly some structural issues that persist for specific retailers, overall, demand for space far outstrips supply, and as a result, we continue to see lease rate gains and strong same-store NOI growth across our portfolio. While we are pleased to benefit from the continued strong performance of our assets, cap rates have yet to reflect the stability and credit quality of cash flows commensurate with prime power centers. Recently, this has created a unique opportunity for us to accelerate our acquisitions activity while sourcing off-market transactions with a variety of our joint venture partners. This effort has allowed us to achieve pricing that is 25 to 50 basis points wide of the already mispriced market cap rates while prudently financing to continue our deleveraging efforts. Not only does this further simplify our story by reducing our number of joint venture partners, it gives us access to a proprietary pipeline of low risk acquisitions that are not broadly marketed. As you read in our third quarter transactions' press release, we were a net buyer during the quarter and we expect to be a net buyer going forward, particularly during this period of asset mispricing. In the long term, we all know that markets are efficient. However, no different than many of you whose job it is to identify market inefficiencies in the near term, we are taking advantage of such opportunities that currently exist. In addition to our ability to source off-market transactions at attractive pricing, our recent upgrade to investment-grade from S&P in the reiteration of our investment grade status, coupled with an outlook upgrade from Moody's, has allowed us to be more competitive from a cost of capital perspective. Since the upgrade from S&P in mid-September, our bond spreads on tenured paper have tightened by approximately 100 basis points. Our dramatically-reduced cost of capital has further enhanced our ability to make prudent investments on behalf of our shareholders, and we expect this trend to continue. We will also continue to actively execute our capital recycling program, manage our balance sheet, pursue additional positive feedback from the rating agency community and prudently pursue broad access to all forms of capital. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our overall cost of capital and the opportunities it has created to pursue attractive investments. We are cognizant of the fact, however, that the market is too smart to let the current condition of asset mispricing to persist. Asset pricing efficiency is sure to return to the marketplace as private and public market investors realize that long-term operating results in the high-quality power center space represents an extremely attractive investment opportunity on a relative and absolute basis. As a result, we expect further cap rate compression going forward, enhanced value creation and NAV growth, further supporting our desire to continue advancing our strategic direction. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. I'd like to spend some time today discussing the leasing environment and our expectations for holiday sales. But first, I will briefly address the quarterly results. As evidenced by another quarter of strong leasing volume, we continue to see robust demand and increasing competition for quality space, resulting in positive trends in both occupancy and leasing spreads. In the third quarter, we executed 230 new deals for 1.2 million square feet. This was the second highest level of quarterly leasing volume by square footage in company history and it was achieved with a new deal spread of 9.8%. We also executed 286 renewals for 1.7 million square feet at a spread of 6.5%, our highest renewal spread in 16 quarters. Combined, we leased 2.9 million square feet during the quarter, which brings us to 8.9 million square feet year-to-date and over 42 million square feet leased in the past 15 quarters. Combined spreads for the quarter were positive 7.0% representing the 10th consecutive quarter of positive leasing spreads. As a result of these achievements, our lease rate is now 94.0%, up 30 basis points over the second quarter. These strong results have been supported in large part by the dramatic shift in the supply and demand dynamic, as today's most successful retailers seek new store growth opportunities and favor the high-quality power center format which offers the most sought after co-tenancy, greatest access and visibility and dramatically-lower operating expenses. We are not surprised by this growing trend and we expect this dynamic to continue, supporting consistently strong operating metrics for the foreseeable future. Our top 40 tenants alone are on track to open 77 million square feet of new stores in 2012, and project to open another 82 million square feet per year in 2013 and 2014. In addition to the continued demand from anchor and junior anchor retailers, there's equally strong demand for smaller space from retailers such as Ulta, Five Below, Tilly's, Carter's, Shoe Carnival, Anna's Linens and Kirkland's. These retailers are looking to aggressively open new stores and represent great candidates for small shop consolidation, as well as ideal users of residual space from big-box downsizings in the 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot range. Furthermore, several traditional department store chains are continuing to aggressively expand their off-price divisions by opening new stores in our power centers, specifically Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off 5th and Bloomingdale's Outlet. Fortunately, our assets are in high demand by these retailers and we continue to source opportunities for these growing companies. With only 16 million square feet or less than 1% of existing inventory of opening at retail expected to be delivered in 2013, demand for space is far outpacing supply. As a result and despite having already achieved significant improvement in our lease rate, we are not done leasing up the portfolio. We see continued future growth from the combination of leasing the existent vacant boxes to releasing the boxes that we were actively trying to recapture from underperforming weaker credit tenants, the vacancy from recent acquisitions and creative in-line leasing through small shop consolidation, downsizings and our extremely successful Set Up Shop program. A specific example of maximizing a recent acquisition by leveraging our operating platform is Brookside Marketplace in Tinley Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. This asset was acquired in the first quarter of this year and is anchored by Target, Kohl's, Dick's Sporting Goods, HomeGoods, PetSmart and Ulta also. In just 7 months, we have improved not only the merchandise mix, but also increased occupancy and NOI. We executed a new lease with Ross Dress for Less on a previously undeveloped parcel, and are in final negotiations with a national credit retailer to consolidate a chronically-vacant small shop wing into a junior anchor box. The addition of these 2 junior anchors, combined with the lease-up of 2 of the previously undeveloped outparcels, will further position this asset as the dominant power center in the market. Once complete, we will have added to the rent roll over 50,000 square feet of new rent paying GLA, improved the lease rate from 90% to 99%, increase NOI by 40%, reduced exposure to small shop space by 10% and most importantly, we will have improved our yield by 110 basis points over the acquisition cap rate to nearly 8%. Another example of creating value in a recent acquisition is Ahwatukee Foothills in Phoenix, Arizona, a center we acquired from a joint venture partner in the third quarter. This power center features anchor tenants such as Ross Dress for Less, PETCO, Jo-Ann, Babies ""R"" Us, AMC Theatres and Old Navy. Here, we relocated and downsized Roomstore furniture, achieving a 50% positive comp on the new space. We split Roomstore's former box and provided a new location for Sprouts Farmers Market, adding a specialty grocery component to the power center, driving additional daily foot traffic and adding value to the surrounding units. We are finalizing a lease for the remaining portion of the former Roomstore box to accommodate a national junior anchor. Combined, this new activity will increase NOI by 15%, improve occupancy from 90% to 95% and improve our acquisition by 60 basis points to over 7.5%. Another opportunity for additional future growth is through downsizings. For example, at Easton Market in Columbus Ohio, a 500,000 square-foot power center, we recently completed the downsizing of a former Kittle's Furniture box and provided Nordstrom Rack with its first store in the Columbus market. Additionally, in the residual space, we signed leases with Tilly's for its first store in the Columbus market and Carter's as they expand their presence in Columbus. With the ability to mark this space to market, we improved the rent per square foot by 80% on Nordstrom Rack space, 150% on Tilly's space and 170% on the Carter's space. Clearly, the ability to grow through downsizing is impactful and we're pursuing these opportunities with several of our oversized tenants. Overall, we see numerous similar opportunities across our portfolio today and expect to uncover additional growth initiatives as we work with retailers to creatively meet their open to buys. We are also growing through small shop consolidation. Over the past 11 quarters, we have consolidated 400 previously-vacant small shop units into 116 mid-box spaces, representing 1.2 million square feet at an average rent of $14 per foot, and highlighting the continued strong demand from retailers in the 5,000 to 10,000 square-foot range. Over the same time frame, we've increased our leased rate for units less than 5,000 square feet from 80% to 84.5%, and have reduced our exposure to these units from 19% to 16.4% of total GLA. We will continue to increase the lease rate of our small shop space with a long-term occupancy goal of over 90%, while continuing to reduce exposure to the same category given its nature of lower credit quality tenants and higher unpredictable turnovers. Overall, the combination of maximizing acquisitions with the value-add leasing in the vacancy we are buying or creating, consolidating small shops and aggressively pursuing downsizings will lead to continued growth across our portfolio. Before I turn the call over to David, I want to quickly remind everyone what we should watch for as we head into the holiday sales season. Volatile headlines may suggest a slowing economy due to the uncertainty created by the election, variable gas prices, conditions in Europe or fluctuating consumer sentiment. However, it is important to remember that successful retailers continue to perform in the face of these headwinds and retailers are planning their holiday selling season accordingly. What we do know is that the retailers who carry the right merchandise at the right price at the right time will undoubtedly thrive during the holiday sales season. And when it comes to margins, nothing is more important than controlling inventory levels, and well-managed inventory levels will be the theme again this year. Other positives this year include 2 extra shopping days, a cooler selling season, improving the prospects for winter goods, and a continued consumer shift to value and convenience. We will be very focused on the timing and percentages offered for holiday markdowns, which often tell the story in advance of official results. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $83 million or $0.27 per share for the third quarter, slightly ahead of our projections and 12.5% above last year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $30 million higher to $113 million or $0.37 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily gains resulting from the acquisition of our joint venture partners interest, offset partially by a write-off of issuance costs associated with the redemption of our Class I Preferred Shares in August. We are very pleased to report another quarter of significant progress improving the quality of our balance sheet, portfolio and our long-term growth prospects, driven largely by the acquisition of high-quality, attractively priced and financed prime power centers. As we have said throughout the year and Dan just previously mentioned, we've reached the current market for power centers represents a unique acquisition opportunity, and we have and we'll continue to take advantage of that dynamic without compromising our investment discipline. During the quarter, we acquired 3 prime power centers for $250 million, and year-to-date, we have invested more than $600 million in primarily off-market purchases of prime power centers. As the majority of these investments represent recapitalizations of legacy joint ventures and purchases of partners interest in shopping centers that we have leased and managed for many years, we have mitigated risk and are confident in our continued opportunity to leverage our operating platform to improve initial yields, consistent with the case studies cited by Paul. We have continued to fund our growth initiatives in a manner that lowers leverage and risk and improves our long-term cost of capital. Investments during the year were funded with proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of $435 million of new common equity. Financed funding investments with equity, we have grown our portfolio of unencumbered assets considerably. During the year, we've added 8 prime power centers, comprised of 3.4 million square feet of GLA for the unencumbered asset pool. And today, this pool of assets is conservatively valued at $5.2 billion, a significant increase from the $4.3 billion at the end of 2010. In early October, we renewed our aftermarket common equity program which provides us flexibility to issue up to $200 million of additional equity to fund growth initiatives going forward. We don't take equity issuance lightly, but we want to have an ATM program in place so that we can efficiently fund investments and further improve the balance sheet when we find opportunities. We have been very active in the capital markets in 2012 and we're pleased with our ability to access numerous forms of capital during the year, which has continued to extend our duration and lower our fixed charges. In addition to our equity funded investments, during the quarter, we issued $200 million of 6.5% perpetual preferred equity and used the proceeds to redeem our 7.5% preferred shares. We have also taken advantage of attractively priced long-term debt raising $650 million of unsecured debt and $1.2 billion of secured debt, including our partner's share. These 2012 financings have a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%, and this capital was largely used to retire debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Last, we were successful in accessing private equity capital during the year, closing the new $1.4 billion joint venture with Blackstone in January. Looking at future capital needs, we have very little near-term debt maturing. There are no remaining consolidated maturities in 2012 and no unsecured maturities until May of 2015. Debt maturities in 2013 of approximately $390 million consists of secured mortgages, the majority of which is a $350 million loan secured by 6 properties. We recently received approval for a 7-year $265 million mortgage from a life insurance company secured by 4 assets with interest fixed at less than 4% to refinance 75% of this loan. The balance will be funded by drawing on the $100 million accordion commitment of our 7-year unsecured term loan which will further expand our unencumbered asset pool, increase our fixed charge coverage ratio, lower our percentage of secured debt and further extend our debt duration. In recognition of our considerable progress in the recent years recycling capital, meaningfully improving the quality of our portfolio, lowering leverage and increasing size of our unencumbered asset pool, combined stronger-than-expected operating results, Standard & Poor's upgraded our bond ratings to BBB- in September. And just last week, Moody's upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive on their current Baa3 rating. Although we are by no means done improving our balance sheet and lowering our cost of capital, the recent progress with the rating agencies represents a meaningful acknowledgment of how much we have accomplished financially and operationally lower our risk profile. DDR bonds are now investment grade rated by both S&P and Moody's, and we expect further improvement in EBITDA, as well as the continued monetization of non-income producing assets to further improve our credit metrics and lower our cost of capital. The more than $600 million of capital that we have invested during the year has funded the acquisitions of large format prime power centers and enhanced the quality of our portfolio and expand our presence in major MSAs, such as Chicago, Portland and Boston, Dallas and Phoenix. We have also improved the quality of our portfolio through dispositions. And while we were net acquirers in the first 9 months of the year, we are not finished pruning non-prime assets. Through the first 9 months of the year, we disposed of $137 million of non-prime assets. And in early October, we closed the $113 million sale of a 750,000 square-foot, primarily lifestyle center owned in a joint venture. We will continue to review the portfolio regularly to identify disposition candidates, and currently have $164 million of assets under contract for sale. During the year we have disposed of $46 million of non-income producing assets, a significant increase from the $30 million of dispositions in the same period in 2011. As you likely noticed from our press release, our 2012 guidance remains $1 to $1.04 per share of operating FFO, consistent with the first half of the year, stronger-than-expected domestic performance continued in the third quarter and offset the considerable negative impact of a lower-than-expected Brazilian currency that has lowered FFO nearly $4 million year-to-date relative to last year. We remain focused on growing EBITDA and NAV, further improving our portfolio quality while lowering our leverage and risk, all of which are translating to results that drive growth in FFO, dividends and total returns over time. With respect to 2013, we are in the process of finalizing our plans and expect to release guidance and significant assumptions underlying our expectations, middle of January, as we have in the past. That said, we are optimistic about our prospects for 2013 and expect solid earnings growth, combined with the potential for strong relative growth in the dividend to generate an attractive total return in the coming years. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call over to the operator, and we will begin addressing your questions. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Schmidt, Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: Your recent acquisitions have included some of the larger power centers in the country. And given that you already own some midsized and very large power centers, I wondered if you could outline the opportunities and challenges of these sort of ubersized power centers relative to sort of more midsized product.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, Craig, we're in a position right now where we really do feel that size matters. We like larger centers for a number of reasons. Number one, they offer great co-tenancy variety to whatever retailers may be interested in occupying vacant space, so there's a very diverse merchandise mix that we can offer to the consumer. And probably most importantly, we are definitely in an era of retail fluctuation. And retail is evolving and flexibility is incredibly important. And we like the fact that the large power centers aren't sitting on a 12-acre site -- and I'd much rather have a 60-acre site today, where we have the flexibility to move buildings, add buildings, expand buildings, take buildings down and whatever it may take to accommodate the evolution of the retail environment. So the large power centers are attractive to us. Tenant demand for those centers is extraordinarily high. Co-tenancy is absolutely a high priority for retailers today and they give us maximum flexibility. So as a result, we will continue to pursue those centers. The medium-sized power centers that we have offer a similar opportunity, but just slightly less flexibility. And given the current environment we obviously like having that flexibility in our back pocket.
Paul W. Freddo: Craig, I think it's also worth pointing out that as we look at any acquisition, regardless of the size of the power center, we're seeing opportunity. I think the examples I cited in the script were great examples of that where we're confident we are seeing something that maybe others aren't in terms of upside.
David John Oakes: And I think it's just a less competitive acquisition environment. While there's tons of capital out there, across-the-board you just look at the transactional activity even just of the public companies let alone digging into the data of all the private companies and the volume of transactions and the competition that I think you're seeing for some of the smaller format centers, in addition to the fundamental opportunity that Dan and Paul outlined, we think this allowed us to achieve better pricing on some of the larger format centers in addition to having better growth profiles over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Just -- you mentioned some outlets or outlet concepts that are opening up, and touring your assets recently, it sounds like there's more demand from some of these outlet concepts to open up at your centers. Do you think that this cannibalizes the overall outlet market, the sales for outlets, or you think this will expand the pie?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it expands the pie a little bit, Alex. I'll let Paul comment in a second but I think it expands the pie. I think the outlet business is while it's an important and growing part of the retail environment in our country, it's still relatively small. I think you'll be -- you won't be surprised when a lot of the centers that are currently proposed don't get built. I think they'll be far less built than is currently on the table. And as a result, these tenants, like Gap and Saks Off 5th and Blooming's Outlet and Nordstrom Rack, et cetera, need growth opportunities. And the spend structure of our asset class, and going back to Craig's question about size and opportunity and flexibility, gives them the ability to open new stores and satisfy their open to buys without relying on what could be somewhat questionable development projects that may or may not be delivered at any given time. So I think there's plenty of room for growth. I think that it's not likely that these stores will cannibalize anything else from the outlet business. I think it's just retailers evolving their format and evolving their desires to attract the consumer who are interested in value and convenience, and obviously our centers do that.
David John Oakes: Yes, Alex, the 3 we mentioned in the script were the Rack and Blooming's Outlet and Saks Off 5th, these guys have -- are very confident they can perform in the traditional center, and that's what's really driving this. And as Dan mentioned briefly Gap, we're going to see nothing but negative movement with the traditional Gap stores in the mall locations. But Gap outlet is the driver of the growth for that division, and that's exciting. They're quite comfortable in a center with -- discount-oriented center -- with a Ross or a TJ and a Bed Bath, and they know they can achieve the same results or even better than they do in a traditional outlet setting.
Operator: And your next question comes from Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: As you -- the question is, as you think about your rollover next year, what are your expectations for leasing spreads for non-anchor tenants? It looks like the expiring rent is fairly low. It's about 10% below the portfolio average. Are we through all of the pre-recession leases? And I'd imagine that you've been working on some of these deals, how much visibility do you have on that right now?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The visibility we do have, Todd, is that we will continue to increase the spreads on those non-anchor tenants. One thing you have to be aware of when we -- when you grow the spread, it will vary quarter to quarter. You may have a quarter where the smaller space has a more positive spread than the anchor space. The anchor space we're clearly beyond the recession, and we actually have leased up most of that came back to us in '08 and '09, so you're looking at a more consistent growth rate in the spreads. And I would tell you, even in the non-anchors, we hope to see continued improvement in those spreads.
Operator: And the next question we have comes from Paul Morgan, Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: Just looking at your-- a couple of your operating metrics, I mean, you're at 94% occupancy. You were from '05 to '07 kind of regularly in the 96% kind of territory, and your lease spreads were sort of double around where they are now. And you've obviously done a lot of work on improving the portfolio composition over the past 5 years. I mean, how quickly can we get to those levels, and I guess presumably potentially exceed them and kind of over? What are the catalysts that you need to get there in terms of maybe market conditions?
Paul W. Freddo: Well, clearly, the catalyst, Paul, is the lack of new supply and the continued demand and it's a great question, as we think about it and we talk about it all the time. I would've told you a few years ago that 95, 95.5 might feel like full occupancy and what could be considered a new normal. I don't feel that way anymore. I can't tell you exactly when we'll get there, but we're quite confident, as we improve the quality of our assets of our portfolio and we continue to see strong demand and as we continue to reduce small shop, the smallest shop space as a percentage of our total GLA, that we're going to see that full occupancy number be a little higher. When we hit that, I don't know at this point, but the momentum is good, the demand is great and I'm confident it will be higher than we would've thought a few years ago.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And I think, Paul's comments hit exactly on a same-store basis, but don't forget that while he's trying to push occupancy as high as possible for the total portfolio, Dan and I are trying to buy vacancy and find opportunities out there in the market and make his job more challenging by giving more inventory of that product. We think that's where some of the most attractive returns are available where we know more about tenant demand than an existing owner and we can buy something very selectively in the high 80s, 90% occupancy range like the example in Chicago that Paul talked about earlier and then challenge the leasing team to lease that up. We've had great success with that so far. But just when you think about those overall portfolio metrics, you might see continued progress on that same-store pool, but we hope we're successful in sourcing some attractively-priced vacancy that can lead to good returns and good NOI growth over the year or so after we initially make that acquisition.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Donnelly, Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Dan, you mentioned in your remarks that prime assets were mispriced or are mispriced. And I think, in last quarter's call, David had touched upon how some of the top coastal markets might in fact be overpriced and that I think that A-quality product was seeing greater improvement in cap rates than other peers. Can you guys give us a little more detail in your thinking about the mispricing, maybe just where do you think it is today on prime, where do you think it could be? Which cities can you think present the best opportunities and does that imply that the B product is also mispriced, too?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: In general, there is an extraordinary amount of capital out there chasing most, if not all, income-oriented opportunities, particularly those that are perceived to be lower risk. When you look at real estate in general and shopping centers in general, a disproportionate amount of that capital has been focused exclusively on coastal markets. A disproportionate amount of that capital has been focused largely on grocery-anchored product where, thus far, there hasn't been nearly as much capital focused on major MSAs but not necessarily with immediate ocean access that have larger footprints as Dan talked about earlier that usually do have a grocery component but along with that smaller format, just grocery-anchored neighborhood center. And so we think it's just an environment where there's less capital currently looking at the product we are and that's why you have seen us be a much larger acquirer this year because we do still think there's an opportunity there. I would be cautious going too far to your question down the quality spectrum and saying what that means for B or even C assets because there is certainty a massive retailer demand overall, but it is disproportionately focused on the higher-quality centers in larger MSAs. Whether you can drive to the ocean in a day or not, I think we're seeing good demand consistently for those higher-quality A centers, even A-, B+ centers. When you get lower than that, I think it's a challenge and that's why you haven't seen us active in that market and you probably won't. So I think you've seen pricing there tighten a bit, especially with maturing or improving CMBS market, but that hasn't been where we've been focused and not where we see the most significant opportunity today.
Operator: And your next question comes from Quentin Velleley from Citi.
Quentin Velleley: Just following on in terms of acquisitions, I get the sense that you're sort of potentially ready to ramp acquisitions, can you maybe talk a little bit about the size of the current pipeline that you're seeing and also what your preference on funding that pipeline would be? Would you look to do it on a leverage mutual basis or sort of match fund deals with equity?
David John Oakes: The pipeline we're looking at continues to be significant as it has been for a while. We continue to close a very small proportion of those deals simply because we are very focused on maintaining our investment discipline. You know this company suffered mightily from losing that at times in the past and that is not at all lost on this management team or board. And so I think it continues to be a very disciplined process where we look at a ton of stuff and end up buying a very small percentage of the overall product we look at. I think we continue to be much more focused on one-off or very small portfolio opportunities. We continue to be very focused on opportunities with assets that we've owned and managed. Oftentimes, a joint venture for many years given the lower risk profile there. And so I think the profile of what we've seen throughout the course of this year is consistent with what we're looking at going forward. We obviously think that we've got an operating platform that provides us information, they've put us in an extremely strong position to underwrite assets. In most cases, that means we know too much to bid as aggressively as others. And in some cases though, it means we know more and can get a greater level of comfort. And so I think you will see us continue to be active in major MSAs and large format prime power centers like we have been year-to-date. From a funding perspective, the natural means of funding that we've used over the past few years has been disposition of non-prime assets. I think acquiring good assets is important for improving portfolio quality, but selling the bad stuff is probably even more important in terms of the way it changes the overall metrics and the overall efficiency of an operating platform. And so we'll continue to be active on the disposition front. We acknowledge we were a little lower on dispositions during the quarter, but we have quite a bit in the hopper through the fourth quarter so I think that'll continue to be a major driver through the end of this year, as well as in the next year. And to the extent that we see acquisition opportunities that exceed that, we've obviously been open to funding that primarily with equity over the past year. I think, on a go forward basis, equity would continue to be an important piece of that, but again, it's got to be driven by finding attractive enough opportunities to justify us selling equity to fund that. So I think you can look at equity as a portion of the funding at least 1/2 of that, so you're talking about transactions that are still going to be beneficial to the balance sheet. But at this point, with the dramatically improved cost of capital particularly related to our unsecured debt, and I think you can also think about a portion of the transactions being funded with 10-year bond issuance now that we're talking about comfortably sub 4% levels for that capital but would still look to make transactions, both balance sheet and portfolio quality-accretive and not just solving for FFO growth by throwing acquisitions on the line.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Just to expand a little bit on what David's saying, Quentin. In our investor presentation, which is obviously online, there's a list of proprietary pipeline joint venture assets that we have some sort of governance rights to. And we have been very pleased with acquiring assets, off-market assets that we already managed, assets where we know where the opportunity is, assets, quite frankly, that may have been capital-starved. For example, IBDT portfolio that we did with Blackstone, where we knew there was a lot of pent-up demand and a lot of deals available, a lot of opportunities to grow, it's just that their venture was not in a position to take advantage of it so -- from a capital perspective. So there's great opportunity. We like to keep certain assets certainly in the family. We're working with our joint venture partners on a regular basis to do that. It's highly unlikely that we'll be involved in a market bid where you have multiple people coming in and bidding for an asset through a process. That's something that often does not lead to the efficiency of pricing that we're looking for.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance, Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: Dan, I think, a few quarters ago, you talked about looking at a $750 million redevelopment pipeline over the next 5 years. Now that you're increasing your acquisition activity, what do you think it will mean for the redevelopment pipeline over time?
Paul W. Freddo: Cedrik, this is Paul. I mean, clearly, the $750 million we initially talked about and are working towards include some future acquisitions. As we continue to go, we've identified quite a bit of that $750 million today, some of that through our existing portfolio, some of it through the recent acquisitions we talked about in the script. So it's certainly something we consider in the $750 million as we plan out our final number going forward. It obviously continues to be a very big part of our big growth initiative for us. The spend continues to ramp up and we remain on track to spend about $120 million this year, which is well in excess of the $30 million we spent last year and we'll see even more of that ramp up in 2013 and beyond. But at this point, we are not going beyond the initial $750 million as we do include future acquisitions as part of that initiative.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas C. Truxillo: Obviously, you guys have made tremendous strides in terms of your balance sheet and you've gotten recognition from that from the agencies finally. Just looking forward, you don't have a lot of maturities coming due. You already took care of most of the '13s. But your secured debt seems still relatively high for the peer group. Can you provide any comments on continuing to look to use more unsecured debt and to continue to grow that unencumbered asset as secured debt matures in '14 and '15?
David John Oakes: Yes, we are absolutely in agreement, I think, with the direction of your question. Over time, secured debt did get to be a higher and higher percentage of the balance sheet, partially because of joint ventures and partially because even for consolidated asset, there was a period of time a few years ago where secured was either the only thing available or a much more efficient means of financing. We recognize that in the stronger environment that exists today, where we do have opportunities for multiple sources of new capital, that our interest in unsecured meaningfully exceeds our interest in secured. And I think you'll continue to see the progress in the proportion of secured debt going down over time. It's obviously a portion of the initiative with the 2013 refinancings where you will see mortgage debt replaced by unsecured debt. I think we have an even more significant opportunity in '14 with an opportunity to further replace secured with unsecured. The biggest individual maturity in '14 is the TALF CMBS deal that we've done a few years ago. If you remember, the challenges of that period of time being the first CMBS market back -- first CMBS field back in the market, as well as the Fed's involvement in that process ended up with just the most stringent underwriting that's ever occurred for securitization. And so, I think, today, that leaves us with an extraordinarily under-levered pool that, at minimum, would allow us to remove a considerable number of assets and grow that unencumbered pool, but could also let us easily replace some or all of that secured debt with unsecured. So I think that's clearly the direction you see us going. We made progress this year. We'll make more progress next year. Also as some of our joint ventures are rationalized, whether it's just selling assets or whether it's us buying those assets, you've seen a considerable number of those assets move from a joint venture structure where they almost have to have secured debt to a wholly-owned structure where we could look at it, putting those in the unencumbered pool and effectively applying unsecured debt to those. And so you've seen us make progress and you will see considerably more in the coming years that we will continue to show you on a regular basis, including the refinancing activity we outlined for the very early 2013 maturity.
Operator: And the next question comes from Vincent Chao, Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: I just wanted to get your thoughts on sort of the initiatives by retailers like Wal-Mart to deliver online orders through their stores. Just wondering if that's something you think -- are you seeing others adopt more and more of and whether or not you think that's really going to make a material difference in sort of the ongoing battle between sort of the online-only retailers versus the bricks and mortars guys.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That's a great question, Vincent. I'll tell you, we are seeing a lot more of it and we're going to see even more of it. It makes a heck of a lot of sense. Buying online and pickup in-store is one way of not eroding margin. One of the things that's happening, as you look across the retail community, is that as Internet sales in the traditional sense grow, operating margin erodes because of the shipping costs in particular, or the inability to charge for shipping, you have to give free shipping. So we think that shopping online, buying in-store, buying online, pickup in-store, buying online and returning in-store, all of which are positive because it's bringing people to the store and to the acknowledgment of the convenience and the dominance of the brick and mortar location has all been very, very positive. So I think we're going to see buying online or -- and picking up in-store or shopping online and buying in-store, all increase as smart retailers continue to evolve in a multichannel environment. So I think -- and I also think it has a significant effect on profitability while it's also taking advantage of the consumers' demand for instant gratification. People like to have what they want when they want it. And if you see something online and you can go down the road and pick it up in the store, that's a very, very attractive way to communicate with the consumer and it's a very attractive and efficient way to distribute goods. So I think we're going to continue to see various aspects of online in-store interaction. But buying online, pick up in-store, shop online, buy in-store, the whole buying online and even return to store or exchange in-store is all going to become ever more active in our business.
Paul W. Freddo: Vincent, it's also worth noting, as we go into this holiday season, we've heard many of the larger retailers, the discounters, the electronics guys and others talk about price matching and same-day delivery. These guys are not sitting back. They're obviously going after the business that the pure online plays are doing. I also think it's one of the reasons why we're seeing a little bit less of the downsizing that had been previously reported because if shop online and pickup in-store accelerates, which it is, and then the real size of the store, you may need lesser square footage of actual selling space, but you might need more stockroom space because you have people coming to pick up. The competitive advantage is, of course, that you can get same-day goods, and in order to have same-day goods, you must have a sufficient inventory levels to deliver those same-day goods. So I think that's why you see some hesitation from some of the retailers that have previously talked about downsizing and from actually executing the downsizing strategy because they're not quite sure exactly how the store is going to weigh out and how much stockroom space they need as they continue to push for a store relationship between online and the consumer.
Operator: And your next question comes from Alex Goldfarb, Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Yes, just following up that question, are you guys seeing more retailers trying to reinvigorate the concept of a genuine sales force? I mean, if you look at what happened at Best Buy or Circuit City, they didn't really have salespeople. So you've got customers walking into the store, touching the product, going on their iPhone, ordering it, which seems crazy. Are you seeing more retailers rediscover the importance of having a well-trained commission-based sales force? Or is that not really how they're tackling the Internet?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Alex, they've rediscovered the need for that. That's where we are right now. I mean, I think there's still a lot to be proven. As far as with the electronics guys and in Best Buy specifically, there is no doubt where they are focused and that's almost to the appleseque in terms of their sales staff and how they treat and educate the customer. But right now, I would tell you that it's probably at the stage where they've identified we have to do that and we're seeing some initiatives on the part of retailers and some progress, but they've still got a long way to go. You can see it more and more from the -- especially that category.
David John Oakes: And while I think having a professional sales force and a motivated sales force is important, it's not nearly as important as having the right merchandise in the store. And a great sales force trying to sell bad merchandise won't work. So while I think that's important, I don't think anyone should think that, that's going to be the solution for stores that are struggling in gaining consumer acceptance of their merchandise. And it'll take some time, in some cases, for some of the retailers to realize that. But again, no matter how good your sales folks are, if you don't have the right product in the store, and some of the retailers you mentioned, Alex, are exactly what the issue is, they don't have the right merchandise in the store, a good sales force is not going to help. And just like great real estate cannot bail out a bad retailer. Great real estate cannot bail out a bad merchant. The consumer is just simply too smart.
Operator: And your next question comes from Cedrik Lachance, Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: I just wanted to follow up on Brazil actually. Can you comment a little bit on the performance of your portfolio in Brazil currently? And then what was the impact of the Brazilian operations to your reported same-store NOI this quarter?
David John Oakes: Conditions in Brazil continue to be relatively strong. We'd characterize it as an absolute deceleration from last year, but I think we tried to be very candid at that time in saying that we thought the results and the growth in 2011 was unsustainable. And so while the full results from the third quarter will come out when Sonae Sierra Brazil reports results early next week, I think we can say that conditions continue to be relatively strong growth in the high single-digits has replaced growth in the high teens from 12 months ago. It's been further impaired by currency, the depreciated 20-ish percent, 15% to 20% depending on what exact period you're looking at. And so it's certainly been a drag on our overall results when you have that currency overlay on the decelerated growth for this year. It's still a market where we see a considerable opportunity for our operating assets and for the remaining condo development. Enthusiasm works, but certainly a slower growth environment, and last year's assets still stronger growth than we see available just about anywhere else from a macro standpoint. It did have a slightly positive benefit to same-store NOI for the quarter. So on a pro-rata basis, the 3.7% same-store NOI growth that we reported was improved by approximately 20 basis points relative to what it would have been on a just-domestic basis. So a slight help, but 3.5% versus 3.7%, and really very strong numbers and much less of a skew relative to last year when Brazil was a meaningful driver of the overall same-store results. So this year, you are seeing the overwhelming majority of that growth come domestically, but Brazil continues to be a bit of a helpful driver and we would expect that to continue.
Operator: And your next question comes from Samit Parikh from ISI.
Samit Parikh: David, earlier this year, you were out repurchasing your 9.625% unsecured. Is DDR still in the market, repurchasing longer-dated unsecured?
David John Oakes: Year-to-date, we have repurchased $60 million of our 9 5/8 2016 notes. I think, at the time we were buying those, we made the case that while it's a no-brainer from a current yield perspective, more importantly, from a yield to maturity perspective, were we able to raise longer-term capital at a lower yield to maturity than what the 16s were trading at. So from a true economic standpoint, we were better off by effectively prepaying a portion of that interest and getting to replace it with new cheaper debt had not only the current yield benefit but a true economic benefit. Where we look at pricing today, as well as the relatively low liquidity in those bonds, we haven't seen opportunities recently and so you did not see us back in. In the third quarter, I think we've bought more of our debt back in the open market than any REIT by a pretty significant amount and so we're constantly aware of what's going on in that market, both in terms of our incremental cost of capital to fund that, as well as where our bonds are trading, but we haven't seen opportunities lately the way that we did earlier in the year. So it's something we continue to monitor but haven't been active real recently and also when we think about a tender for those bonds and anything close to make whole sort of pricing, I think that is just a premium and an extremely low yield maturity at which we'd be buying those back where -- while you might have a current yield benefit, we just don't see the economic gain to DDR from prepaying those. We'll continue to be opportunistic, but we didn't see anything happen in the third quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from Michael Mueller, JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: In terms of the acquisitions, a lot of what you've done, it looks like it's on balance sheet, you've been buying out partner interest. And I know, Dan, you mentioned there are partnership or JV agreements where you have certain rights. If we look down the road, say, 3 years or 5 years, and look at the JVs that are remaining and outstanding today, because it's -- do we get -- do you have the sense that, that number's going to be very different a few years from now?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, I do think that we expect the number of joint ventures to be different as we look out a few years. It's already changed pretty significantly from a point when we had 15 to almost 20 total joint ventures including a number of one-off joint ventures. And today, we're right around 10. I do think that we make a case that there's a value to that business, there's value to us being able to run out what we think is certainly the highest-quality operating portfolio out there. There's value to having access to private equity which might be priced differently in certain points of the cycle than what public equity is available at. But I think that historic perspective of let's work with as many people as possible, even on very small joint ventures is one that we just don't think makes a lot of sense going forward. So I think you could expect that number to certainly be smaller as we look out a few years, but a smaller number of larger potentially joint ventures than the average size of our venture today and with higher quality, best of breed sort of partners that have a long-term alignment of interest. And so when you've seen us add people like Blackstone to that mix, it doesn't necessarily have a perfect alignment of interest because they do have a little greater interest in debt and a little shorter-term timeline and to recognize their profits versus our longer-term ownership mindset. I do think you've seen us actively work on a larger deal with a group like that rather than some of these one-off transactions you've seen in the past and we've been actively working our way out of some of those smaller ventures and I think you could expect to see that continue and us deal with less people on a joint venture basis going forward.
Operator: And I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, all, for joining us this morning. For those of us who are -- those of our friends on the call who are still having difficulty with power and telephones, et cetera, we appreciate the efforts and we hope that you get a sense of normalcy back as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."
19,SITC,4,2012,2013-02-13 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by reiterating that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2012 results and even more pleased with our 2013 guidance and dividend increase. None of which should be a surprise given the transformation of our portfolio through significant capital recycling, rebuilding our balance sheet and the successful execution of our numerous other strategic objectives and corporate initiatives that David and Paul will address in more detail momentarily. However, before that, I'd like to address the macroeconomic backdrop we see in 2013. There have been several headlines and conversations regarding headwinds facing the consumer, particularly concern surrounding fiscal policy, higher payroll taxes and less supportive interest rate expectations. While there was certainly merit to these concerns, I encourage you to look at the factors that truly influence the consumer and consistently translate into retail sales. Recent improvements in the jobs market, coupled with wage increases and rising home prices continue to serve as tailwinds for the consumer. Specifically in December, American incomes posted the greatest increase since 2004 with personal income growth of 2.6%, according to the Commerce Department. Moreover, consumer net worth continues to improve with rising home prices and personal balance sheets reflect increased strength and liquidity as debt service payments as a percent of disposable income are near an all-time low. All of this led to strong retail sales in January and increases in full year guidance for many of our key retailers in the value driven sectors. While there are certainly plenty of risk in the market caused by instability in Washington and elsewhere, the consumer continues to tell us that the most important factors that influence retail sales are jobs and wages. It's not consumer confidence, payroll taxes, events in Europe or even gas prices. We have seen this quarter-after-quarter and month-after-month with each passing retail sales report. With wage growth and greater job stability, we continue to see increases in retail sales to those retailers who deserve it most and those market share gains are visibly going to several of our key retailers. Markets clearly have a psychology and as we've seen in recent months, this market has shrugged off legislative dysfunctionality that created justifiable cause for concern. The greatest downside risk for the continued momentum is that we legislate ourselves back into a recession, and while I think that's very unlikely, certainly not outside of the realm of possibility given past action and conduct from our leaders in Washington. However, the consumers once again proving to be resilient and our portfolio continues to enjoy the macro tailwinds that benefited us in 2012 and continue in 2013. The clear consumer preference is for value and convenience. What does this mean for DDR? As you saw in our 2013 guidance press release, we are expecting FFO growth of 6% at the midpoint driven by continued improvements in operational metrics as well as our capital recycling efforts to advance the improvement in portfolio quality. Retailers continue to seek new store growth in a supply-constrained market and our portfolio has become a first look for several of the fastest-growing, most financially successful retailers. As a result, we expect to increase our portfolio lease rate to 95%, grow same-store NOI between 2% and 3%, while improving our credit quality of cash flow beyond the current historic levels. Additionally, our revamped balance sheet and reduced cost of capital from its prudent transactional volume, and we continue to find attractive investment opportunities relative to current market pricing. We are not done growing our portfolio, improving our balance sheet or executing any of our strategic objectives. As a result, 2013 will be the continuation of our effort to actively monitor and participate in market opportunities as we prudently pursue the creation of long-term shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Paul to discuss portfolio operations.
Paul W. Freddo: Thanks, Dan. Before spending some time discussing the current leasing environment, recent retail sales results and 2013 guidance, I would like to highlight our accomplishments in the fourth quarter, which led to continued improvement across our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we executed 471 new leases and renewals for 2.4 million square feet. Spreads on renewals were up 6.8% and new leasing spreads were up 11.7%. More importantly, on a pro rata basis, new deal spreads were 260 basis points higher at 14.3%. Combined leasing spreads were positive 7.6% and on a pro rata basis, spreads were 20 basis points higher at 7.8%. For the full year, we executed 1,958 new leases and renewals for 11.3 million square feet, resulting in a year end lease rate of 94.2%. This represents a 20 basis point improvement sequentially. As evidenced by another quarter of double digit new deal spreads and our strongest renewals spread in 16 quarters, the current leasing environment, coupled with our improved portfolio quality, is clearly having a positive impact on our portfolio metrics. Same-store NOI was up 4.3% at 100% and 4.4% pro rata for the fourth quarter. And it's worth noting that our consolidated U.S. portfolio was up over 5% for the quarter. Regarding 2013, our expectations for same-store NOI growth is 2% to 3%. As mentioned in our guidance, we expect to recognize the majority of this growth in the back half of 2013 due to the timing of move-outs and 2013 rent commencements. Importantly, the majority of this growth is already committed through leasing completed prior to year end 2012. Of approximately 7.5 million square feet of lease expirations in 2013, 55% were renewed or took options prior to year end and the positive results of those deals are reflected in the renewal spreads we've reported. Given the strong head start to 2013, we are confident that we will achieve a high retention rate for renewals and continue to grow our renewal spreads in 2013. Additionally, as of the end of the fourth quarter, we have completed over 60% of the new deals with a budgeted rent commencement date in 2013. Our optimism going into 2013 is based on our progress to date, our deep pipeline of potential new deals, the lack of new supply and the growing demand we continue to experience across our portfolio. On a macro basis, in 2013, less than 16 million square feet of new open air space will be developed, with only a fraction of that space being competitive with our prime power centers. In addition, 30 of our top tenants alone have combined open-to-buys for more than 150 million square feet in the next 2 years. This dynamic results in a more strategic approach to leasing allowing for the retenanting of underperforming tenants with high credit quality retailers, the rightsizing of boxes and the consolidation of historically vacant small shop space. Even with less obvious vacancy in our portfolio, we are confident we will creatively lease another 11 million square feet of space in 2013. As it relates to our retail outlook, I'd like to first update you on our takeaways from a year of retailer meetings, portfolio reviews and market observations. 2012 marked a year of greater cooperation, flexibility and agility on behalf of retailers. Nearly every retailer with whom we met highlighted flexibility and store size and configuration as being crucial in this low supply market. Examples of this include anchor retailers such as Walmart with their small neighborhood market footprint, box users such as TJX, Dick's Sporting Goods and Bed Bath & Beyond with their ability to take a variety of space configurations, and mid-box users such as Shoe Carnival, Five Below and Tilly's, all of which are aggressively expanding in the power center sector with high levels of flexibility in store size and configuration. Another recurring theme during our discussions was e-commerce. While nearly every retailer discussed future investments in e-commerce, none said that it would be at the expense of new brick-and-mortar locations as margins clearly remain in store, not online. Retailers further emphasized the importance of maintaining and improving profit, primarily through margin expansion. Given this importance of margins in the relationship to sales, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing holiday winners and losers. While headlines and opinions were volatile, our value and convenience-oriented retailers were consistent winners. They not only won market share, but maintained or improved margins. Ross and TJX are great examples as they both outperformed the retail sector by posting positive same-store comps of 6% and raised guidance after Christmas and then again after reporting strong January results. Even less often discussed power center retailers such as Stein Mart and Pier One participated in the market share grab, posting high single digit comps and reporting that they were able to grow market share without negatively impacting margins. Target is an example of a retailer that is not willing to sacrifice margin for the benefit of sales. Over the holiday season, their sales were relatively flat, which might have appeared disappointing on the surface. Through disciplined inventory management and controlled promotional events, they were able to maintain a strong margin level allowing them to guide to a meet or beat for fourth quarter earnings. You've heard me say this before, sales are nice, but margins are better. Conversely, traditional department stores such as JCPenney, Sears and Bon-Ton continue to post anemic sales, while watching their margins erode, putting their market share up for grabs and resulting in disappointing earnings. We expect this trend of winners and losers to continue and are confident that our tenants are the obvious beneficiary of consumer preferences and market share gains. We also continue to see a significant shift in consumer spending patterns in the grocery segment. Competition for traditional grocers includes discounters such as Walmart and Target, warehouse clubs such as Sam's, Sam's Club, BJ's and Costco, and specialty grocers such as Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joe's and the Fresh Market. We expect this trend to continue given that traditional grocers operate with razor-thin margins, making it difficult to compete with the low-cost discount and warehouse club providers on one end as well as specialty grocers that continue to carve out a strong high price point niche. The bottom line is that the traditional grocer is being squeezed at both ends and this dynamic, based on reported market share gains, has no end in sight. As we continue to experience these changes in consumer shopping patterns, our strategy to improve the quality of our portfolio and to align ourselves with high credit value and convenience-oriented retailers has remained consistent. In the last 3 years, we've leased 34 million square feet and 1/3 of that space was leased to high credit retailers such as Walmart, Target, Kohl's, Dick's Sporting Goods, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy Baby, World Market, PetSmart and others. These are the retailers winning the wallets of the consumer every day. Given our growing exposure to best-in-class retailers, our strong start to the year and the continued shift in consumer spending preferences, we expect strong deal velocity in 2013 resulting in a positive impact on rental spreads. And I'll now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO for the fourth quarter was $84 million or $0.27 per share slightly ahead of our plans. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $62 million or $0.20 per share. Non-operating items during the quarter were mainly a noncash loss from the deconsolidation of developed land in Canada and transaction costs related to the recapture of an anchor pattern fine shopping center in Pasadena, California. For the full year, operating FFO was $312 million or $1.03 per share, an increase of 6.2% over 2011 results. From an investment standpoint, the fourth quarter was another period of strong execution of our strategic objective to improve the quality of our portfolio while lowering leverage and risk and preparing the company for long-term growth at the same time. In December, we purchased 2 market dominant power centers in North Carolina for $151 million funded primarily with $75 million of new common equity as well as our share of asset sale proceeds during the quarter of $62 million. Carolina Pavilion in Charlotte was acquired for $106 million and Poyner Place in Raleigh for $45 million. These properties have a combined lease rate of 95%, average trade area household incomes of $80,000 and trade area populations of 590,000 people. Carolina Pavilion was purchased in an off-market transaction from Blackstone and features anchor tenants such as Target, Kohl's, Nordstrom Rack, Ross, buybuy Baby, Bed Bath & Beyond, Jo-Ann and AMC Theatres. Additionally, 2 new national retailers, PetSmart and Golfsmith, will soon join the Carolina Pavilion anchor lineup filling a portion of the 85,000 square feet of currently vacant space. Poyner Place features anchor tenants such as Target, Ross, Old Navy, World Market, Shoe Carnival and Pier One. Carolina Pavilion and Poyner Place are not secured by mortgages and have been added to our growing high-quality unencumbered asset pool. For the full year, we closed $2.1 billion of acquisitions, our share of which was $760 million. Investments in 2012 were funded mainly with $511 million of new common equity issued throughout the year and our share of disposition proceeds, which were $239 million. It is very important to note that 2012 disposition proceeds include the sale of nearly $100 million of non-income-producing assets. We were pleased with the increased level of non-income-producing assets sales in 2012 and expect to continue this monetization process in 2013. Our capital recycling efforts over the last 5 years have resulted in significant value creation for all DDR stakeholders and position the company well for strong revenue growth in the future. The great majority of high-quality, attractively priced prime power centers that we acquired in 2012 were off-market transactions, properties that we have managed for many years and sourced through relationships with existing partners. The tenancy in these centers include some of our closest retail partners and the nation's most profitable retailers, including 11 Targets, 20 TJX concepts, 19 Bed Baths, 10 Ross's and 9 Dick's Sporting Goods. We continue to match fund investments with equity, further improving our balance sheet and growing our portfolio of unencumbered prime shopping centers. During the year, we added 8 large-scale power centers to the unencumbered asset pool, increasing our unencumbered NOI by 18%. Today, over 60% of our consolidated NOI is generated by the unencumbered asset pool, which provides us the greatest opportunity to leverage the DDR operating platform. The last 4 months were also a period of strong execution of our strategic objective to opportunistically raise attractively priced capital. In November, we issued $150 million of 10-year unsecured notes at a yield to maturity of 3.5% by reopening our 2022 bond offering at a premium to par. And in January, we announced the $1.2 billion refinancing of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and secured term loans, significantly extending debt duration and lowering interest cost. Our new $815 million unsecured revolving credit facilities mature in 2018, and pricing is currently LIBOR plus 140 basis points, a decrease of 25 basis points from the rate on the prior facilities. Further annual facility fees were reduced by -- were reduced to 30 basis points. Our new $400 million secured term loan also matures in 2018. Pricing is currently set at LIBOR plus 155 basis points, a decrease of 15 basis points from the prior rate. Also, the size of the term loan was reduced from $500 million with proceeds from the November bond issuance, advancing our goal of lowering secured debt. During 2012, we closed $1.2 billion of long-term financing, with an average maturity of 7.9 years and interest fixed at 3.8%, with the proceeds used to retire nearly $1 billion of 4.8% debt. Our aggressive capital raising efforts over the past few years have certainly lowered our overall cost of capital, balanced our debt maturities and positioned us well for growth. We have no near-term capital needs with only $41 million of debt maturing in 2013, no unsecured debt maturities until 2015 and nearly 80% capacity on our revolving credit facilities. As you know, in January, we issued 2013 guidance on operating FFO of $1.07 to $1.11 per share. As Paul mentioned earlier, our guidance assumes same-store NOI growth 2% to 3% weighted towards the second half of the year. $250 million of acquisitions and $200 million of dispositions, including $50 million of non-income-producing asset sales. We were pleased to meaningfully exceed our guidance for acquisitions and dispositions in 2012 and hope to be able to do so again. However, we will not compromise our investment discipline and we will only pursue attractively priced acquisitions with strong long-term growth prospects in major markets of leading tenants. As Dan mentioned earlier, in recognition of our significantly reduced risk profile, our Board of Directors approved a $0.135 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2013, a 12.5% increase over 2012's quarterly rate. At an annualized level of $0.54 per share, this represents payout ratio of 50% of our operating FFO. The strength of our operating platform, high credit quality of our cash flows and access to competitively priced capital should continue in 2013 and beyond, and we expect further strong relative growth in the dividend over the next few years, while still generating significant free cash flow for reinvestment. Earlier this month, we announced the new dividend reinvestment Direct Share purchase plan, which provides a convenient and efficient opportunity for new investors to purchase DDR shares and for existing shareholders to increase their holdings, while also enjoying the benefit of compound returns through reinvestment of the dividend. The Investor Relations section of our website has a page devoted to the benefits of the new plan with instructions on how to enroll. Finally, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day this fall in Charlotte on October 10. In addition to a corporate update, we will include case studies and a tour of significant recent investment activity, which highlights our thoughtful and opportunistic capital allocation strategy. We hope that you will be able to join us. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I guess my question has to do with the lack of new development and what that means to the retailers. I think you touched on it in your comments; they're being more flexible. I'm wondering if also they're more willing to accept increases on renewals because of that difficulty. And are we seeing any -- trying to seek out alternative avenues like triple net leases to open freestanding stores or anything like that?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Craig, as we've talked about consistently, while there will be a little bit of new development in this sector, it's going to have very, very little, if any, impact on the dynamic we talk about all the time and it absolutely does change. You see it in the spreads. In our negotiations, there's a reason we see our spreads continue to increase and our rent continue to increase, and that's because they need space. That drives the creative approach we take to our leasing, where we're now in a position that we weren't in 4 years ago where we can get people out, get the right people in, and clearly they're willing to pay for it. In terms of the triple net aspect, that doesn't work for everybody. I mean, there are very few retailers that can go it alone, if you will. Certainly some of the larger boxes like the Walmart and the home supply guys and Target and some examples. But it would not work for a Bed Bath & Beyond, as one example, to do a freestanding triple net deal. It's just -- they like to function in shopping centers anchored by people like Walmart and Target, so it's not a real opportunity. It's -- and you've heard me say this before, they will struggle to hit their open-to-buys and their growth expectations, but that again works very, very well for us and our job is to figure out how to get them in, how to get those winning retailers into our centers and continue to improve the mix, credit quality and the rent.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think the other thing to keep in mind, Craig, is that development is not just determined on the financial viability of the project, because I cannot remember a time in the 27 years I've been in this business where the entitlement process is more burdensome and there's more risk associated with it. Whether it be local, state or federal entitlements for projects, the risk profile has expanded dramatically, the amount of upfront capital needed for development to put at risk has been dramatically increased. And of course, the certainty of execution is not there. So even though I think tenants -- the natural and sort of the intuitive thought is that tenants are having a hard time finding space, which is driving rent spreads and one of the things that they can do is maybe pay less than they're paying us, but pay more than they would previously for new development project to spark development. That doesn't mean that it's going to happen, because even if the faucet was turned on today, the average entitlement process for a project of our size -- keep in mind ours are larger than some of the others in the sector -- is 2 to 3 years to get through the entitlement process. So even if the spigot was turned on, you wouldn't see anything new for quite some time and I'm not encouraged by what I see in the municipal side or the governmental side of cooperation to spur development.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: You guys are clearly a power center company. Small shop spaces, is a -- no pun intended -- is a small part of the business. But just curious, there's been strong rebound that we've seen in the results from your peers. And while it is small for you guys, just sort of curious what improvements you've seen in your small shop space, both on an occupancy, perhaps rent. And then also if you can remind us the percent of your portfolio that is small shop.
Paul W. Freddo: Right. In the under 5,000 square foot category, Alex, which we refer to as a small shop, we're about 16% which is down over the course of the year about 100 basis points. So that's one of our objectives obviously to reduce the amount of small shop space in our portfolio. In the fourth quarter, if you look at the supplemental, we were down a little bit in occupancy in that category, but that's solely related to the sale of some assets in Brazil. Obviously, a lot of small shop space that was at a fairly high lease rate. The absence of the sale of the Brazil assets, we would have shown about a 30 basis point improvement in our occupancy in the small shop space. So I would tell you that there's no perfect measurement. I think 15% of portfolio in that smaller space is about right. Obviously, it's got to be the right space and the right asset. That's about 1 million square feet less than we have today and we achieved it through small shop consolidation, asset sales, redevelopment. And in terms of the deals, the spreads were right on with the -- and we see some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter between the spreads for the box space versus the small shops. But this quarter, as an example, we saw right about that double digit increase in new deal spreads on the small shops. So we're going to continue to make progress. Some of our initiatives have been very successful such as Set Up Shop and the Franchise Connect program. But again, I want to drive it a little lower in terms of exposure, maybe another 100 basis points to get it somewhere in that 15%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: On your same-store NOI guidance of 2% to 3% and then your comment that you expect that to be back-end loaded. I mean, can you just help me kind of triangulate that with what you did in 2012, along with your -- I mean, it sounds like you're expecting at least as much pickup in occupancy, lease spreads at least as strong. I'm just trying to see what would prompt a slowdown to that level for the full year given kind of the strength that you're talking about through kind of all the other relevant metrics. And then should we expect flatter than that number for the first part of the year? And would that be true with occupancy as well, and then ramping late in the year?
David John Oakes: Paul, we generally expect 2013 to look somewhat like what you saw in 2012. The supply-demand dynamics, Paul talked about earlier, are still very strong and certainly landlord favorable. Last year, we guided to 2% to 3% with a back-end load to that, and so that's the same guidance for this year. I think we hope to see the same outperformance of that, but where we stand today, I think we believe it's prudent to be at that 2% to 3% range and hope we can exceed it. The seasonality does drive more of that to the latter half of the year. Obviously, retailers are not agnostic as to when they open. And so we do always face a little greater level of move-outs in the earlier part of the year and openings in the second half of the year. So I think that leads to the back-end loading, so you could see some deceleration in the first half of the year, but I think we feel very comfortable with the ability to at least meet the 2% to 3% guidance that we've outlined for same-store NOI for 2013. And as you mentioned, comprised of both the occupancy increases to the same-store pool, which you don't always see flow to the bottom line because we have been adding inventory through acquisitions of some vacancy. But on a same-store basis, certainly expect to see the occupancy increase as well as continued positive rental spreads in the high single low double digits and a considerable volume of leasing activity that justifies our ability to push those rents.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citigroup.
Quentin Velleley: Just in 2012 you'd effectively match funded that $760 million of acquisitions with equity asset sales and retained earnings. I know in 2013 your guidance for acquisition is only $250 million. But if you do beat that significantly, how are you thinking about funding that? Would you continue to match fund with equity? Or would you now be happy to do more of it on a leverage-neutral basis?
David John Oakes: For us, the first part of it has to be, can we source attractively priced acquisition opportunities? We were pleased with what we were able to find in 2012. And we think there are opportunities out there in 2013, but the driver will be, can we find what we believe to be well priced, low-risk acquisition opportunities, where we can take an asset and plug it into our platform and get a good initial return and growth after that? So I think the deals are going to drive the volume of activity rather than just the funding considerations. But obviously, the funding of those transactions is crucially important when you look at the overall picture for DDR. Exactly, as you said last year, we did overwhelmingly fund acquisition activity with new common equity. It was important for us to not only improve portfolio quality but also to show noticeable balance sheet improvement by disproportionately funding those deals with equity. On a go-forward basis, to the extent that we do find attractively priced acquisition opportunities, I think it's reasonable to expect that the net portion of that, so the portion of that, that exceeds disposition activity will be somewhat funded with new common equity. If we can justify the attractiveness of the deals, I think we would add additional equity to fund those, but I do think the proportion of that equity would probably be lower than it was in 2012, and so a greater balance in 2013. Where acquisition opportunities that we find are going to improve portfolio quality, you will see continued balance sheet improvement. But also, I think there can be a portion of debt funding on those acquisitions where you do also see a better balance where instead of FFO neutrality from fully equity-funded acquisitions, you have some amount of benefit to FFO from funding a portion of the net investment activity with debt.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: If we're thinking about the 80 basis point leased increase guidance for this year, for 2013, I guess, the question is, do you see the same sort of increase on an occupancy basis? And then where specifically is it coming from? Is it more pure big-box leasing? Is it small shop leasing, or is it kind of combining the small shops? So is it one aspect of that stuff that's really driving the increase?
Paul W. Freddo: Well, in terms of the guidance, first of all, in comparison to the occupied rate, Michael, I see that moving pretty much in lockstep. We were about 120 basis points spread between occupied and leased at the end of the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter. And as you've noted over the several quarters, I mean down significantly from that peak spread of 300, still not back to that 50 to 100 kind of normalized spread between occupied and leased. So I would see over the course of '13 that we stay in that 100 -- there'll be fluctuations obviously by quarter but 100 to 150 basis points, and gradually as we get closer to that full occupancy number, we will see it get under 100 basis points. But I would think that we're going to have a spread that's pretty consistent with 120 basis points we reported for the third and fourth quarters. Box space drives the leasing just because it's bigger space and that happens through whether it's filling vacancy, replacing existing tenants, consolidations of small shop space, redevelopments. Those are the guys and you see that in our demand book and as we've talked about some of the winning retailers out there who are growing in big numbers, they are the ones that are going to continue to drive it. Again, on the small shop, as I mentioned earlier, we're going to see continued improvement in the lease up, but we're also going to dispose of some of that also through asset sales or through the redevelopment avenue.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think one of the other things to keep in mind, Mike, is -- to keep an eye on, is the small shop consolidation effort, because it's been an extremely successful. And in a supply constrained market, the creation of space -- that's where I think Paul mentioned in his script that we'll creatively lease another 11 million square feet. It's not intuitively obvious, from looking at our portfolio, which is going to be a 95% lease, exactly where that 11 million square feet comes from, except for the fact that tenants are extremely flexible right now. We do have a desire, as Paul mentioned, to reduce our small -- our exposure to small shop space. And when you combine all that, it's going to give us a great opportunity to consolidate small shop space into box users or juniors. So I think that's going to be an interesting statistic to follow through the course of the year, because we're going to basically have to create space in order to meet the growth demands of our retailers and even being creative isn't going to solve the problem that tenants under enormous pressure to find growth opportunities and are having difficulty doing so. It's good for the rent story, it's going to be good for the occupancy story. It will be good for the lease rate story. I'm not convinced it's going to be great for the development story yet, as I mentioned earlier, but I think creatively consolidating small shop space is going to be a trend that is with us for a very long time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samit Parikh of ISI Group.
Samit Parikh: Just a follow-up question to the back half weighted NOI guidance. Just, in your guidance, are you assuming a historical average level of move-outs, call it for Q1 and early Q2? Or are you assuming sort of the same level that you saw in 2012 as to what you'll see in 2013?
Paul W. Freddo: Samit, we're assuming about the same level as 2012. One great example I think is Fashion Bug. We're always going to see more move-outs early in the year than we will later in the year. And that's why you see the inconsistency, if you will, in the same-store NOI number over the quarters. Fashion Bug, we've got 19 right now, they're all closing at the end -- early in the first quarter, over half of them are leased. But obviously, there's going to be downtime. And that's just one example of what we see. With the move-outs, a lot of it is already leased and it's reflected in the lease rate, but you're not going to see those income producing till later in the year. But it's a consistent story year-after-year. We don't see any movement up or down. We anticipate about the same number of move-outs early in this first quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Last quarter you spoke about the mispricing of assets in the marketplace for some larger format power centers. So I was just wondering, do you still see that pricing disconnect today or has the pricing come in a bit over the last few months? And maybe some comments on just pricing for the properties that you're underwriting today would be helpful.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, we do see continued pricing disconnect on what we're underwriting that come in a little bit and there has been some cap rate compression on some of the large power centers that we're looking at currently, primarily because year end sales results were very good and the balance sheets and their credit quality of the cash flow is very attractive to some institutional capital. So we are seeing a little bit, but not enough to discourage us from pursuing some of these assets aggressively. We think that if you look at some of the other sectors and some of the alternative investments, we still feel that power centers are attractively priced. We feel that our portfolio could create value and assets that others look at as core, we look at as core plus. We have very, very close relationship with the tenants that are giving us a lot of direction on assets that they think could be more than they currently are. A number of the assets are still owned today by over-levered or undercapitalized private owners who need to figure out a strategy on what to do with the asset and we're to help. So I think that you'll continue to see us effectively access the market. Like David said, I'll be very disappointed if we hit our guided number of $250 million of acquisitions and I fully expect that we'll exceed it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: I'm just going back to this guidance of $250 million of acquisitions. In light of what you guys did last year and the improvement of the cost of capital, I guess, what is holding you back from meaningfully exceeding that goal? Is it the volume -- lack of deal volume you're seeing? Or are you waiting for more dispositions to fund the acquisitions?
David John Oakes: Wes, last year, we guided to $150 million of acquisitions and our share by year end we ended up closing on $760 million of acquisition activity. So it will be opportunity driven, and we do think this is a very achievable number based on what we're seeing today as well as just being early in the year, and we think our relationships will continue to source some attractive and unique opportunities. I think the biggest risk for us to only achieving or even not achieving the $250 million of acquisitions is the pricing for power centers goes up significantly in the near term. I characterize that as a risk to the acquisition opportunity, but I don't think that's a risk to the company overall as we're obviously very well positioned for that trade. So to the extent that the environment remains as it has been recently -- and of course, things sort of slowed down around year end and they're just actively ramping up again for '13 where transactional activity is becoming a bit more significant, and we are still seeing an acquisition opportunity that allows us to find some assets without having to compromise our discipline. To the extent that environment continues, we think the $250 million is extremely achievable. To the extent that asset pricing goes up significantly, we think that our portfolio is very well positioned for that, but we are active in the market and hope that we can exceed that guidance.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo with Bank of America.
Thomas C. Truxillo: David, obviously you guys have done tremendous work in getting your balance sheet in order. But if I look at your 5-year plan, you still have about a turn of leverage either way you look at it, pro rata or consolidated, a turn of leverage that you need to go down in order to meet your 5-year plan. And you only have about 1.5 years left to do it. So I guess the question kind of goes back to acquisition pace and the earlier question on how you fund that. Don't you kind of have to acquire more assets and with an equity heavy focus on funding those acquisitions in order to accomplish these goals?
David John Oakes: I certainly wouldn't say we have to acquire more assets or fund it with all equity. I think that's certainly one tool. In our normal investor slide deck, we show the various sources of opportunity to lower debt to EBITDA from free cash flow from the non-income-producing asset sales. I think one of them that's going to be more important on a go-forward basis is, we've been ramping up the redevelopment program and putting additional capital into there as well as ramping up development in Brazil. You've been putting more capital into some of those activities where you haven't seen the EBITDA come out the other side. And so I do think there remain a number of significant and important levers for us to continue to reduce debt to EBITDA acquisitions that are somewhat equity funded is absolutely one of those. It was a key for us last year and I think it can still be an important one for us going forward, but it's certainly not the only arrow that we have to achieve those goals. I'd also note, one thing that's difficult when you look at these stats for any individual period is the acquisition activity was disproportionately in the second half of 2012. So year end balance sheet is reflecting the entirety of the debt that was taken on or of the funding that was done for those deals, however, were reflecting much less in a year of the actual EBITDA that's coming from that. So even though the Blackstone deal was announced in early January, it didn't close until midyear and the majority of other transactional activity was all in the second half. The $150 million of North Carolina deals we closed in the fourth quarter were in the last 10 days of December. And so I think there are -- there is a good case for some built-in improvement to those metrics just because of showing a point in time balance sheet that reflects the funding of transactions but not by any means reflecting, certainly not a full year, but in a lot of cases, not even a full quarter for the fourth quarter of that EBITDA. So I think there are quite a few ways that we expect to continue to reduce debt to EBITDA on a consistent basis.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Cedrik Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: Sorry to keep asking questions about acquisitions, but when you look at your joint ventures, how important do you think they can turn out to be as a source of acquisitions over the next 2 or 3 years?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it's going to be a great source of acquisitions, Cedrik, because, number one, the great thing about that relationship is that the underwriting and the due diligence risk is basically removed from any of those assets. So we can be very, very confident in not only the performance of the asset, but the appropriateness of our pricing. So we do have an internal preference to acquire assets from joint venture partners, particularly assets that we have a long operating history with and many of the assets that we actually built. So I think that is an area of absolute focus for us on an internal basis. That being said, we are obviously active in -- outside, we can't rely on that solely because we don't control when those assets trade. But we do certainly have great relationships with our partners who own the assets that we want to own, and we will continue to pursue that as a primary opportunity to provide us product.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs.
Andrew Leonard Rosivach: You had -- digging in, you had a really big move in the development projects, primarily on hold line. It was 409 September 30 and now you're down to 273. And it looks encouraging because obviously you didn't have $130 million of impairments. So I thought maybe you could walk through what you sold and maybe did some stuff get promoted that there were some old predevelopments that now actually makes sense to build?
David John Oakes: Yes, there are a few different pieces of that. I think most importantly, we did have our largest quarter of sale activity in terms of non-income-producing assets in the fourth quarter, including one large site in Toronto and a number in the U.S., one significant one that now shows up as a development in progress. The first part of that was an asset -- was a land sale to a major anchor for that project. So not only cash in the door, but also a project that moves into the CIP line as we've now gotten an anchor building their store and certainly increased value of the land next door as we think about the opportunity to monetize these sites. Some of it is going to be a land sale and in certain circumstances, we'll certainly evaluate whether it makes sense for us to build box space given how strong the demand is next to that. So I think that was another important part of that as some -- as at least one asset moved from on hold into CIP. We continue to make progress on asset sales. We've talked about it, the monetization of non-income-producing assets, for several years and I think it's been an area of disappointment internally that it has taken so long, but the fourth quarter was certainly a highlight for us, both in terms of what we got sold as well as certain projects where a portion was sold and then a portion moves into CIP and may end up being space that we develop over the next several years.
Operator: Your next question comes -- is a follow-up from the line of Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Just going to Brazil quickly. Obviously, we heard from GGP that potentially they may do a direct investment down there. You guys have been pretty clear in the past that you would only execute through Sonae Sierra. So assuming -- just want to confirm, one, that is still the case; two, how you think about Brazil, especially given that there were few minority interests where the company is sold out of or Sonae Sierra sold out of. So should we expect more dispositions from down there? And then what should we expect on the acquisition/development frontline? Should we expect more of that or just a steady-state?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, first, we are only interested in investing in Brazil through our Sonae Sierra entity. We have a very strong partnership there. We're actively involved in the operations of the company. We have 154, I believe, employees down there, and David, Paul and I are very active with our partners in Portugal and we're very pleased with the relationship. So we would not be looking for direct investment opportunities in Brazil at this time.
David John Oakes: Yes, we've got a good team down there. They're executing on the plan, we were active late in the year in selling some nonprime assets. I think that's part of the DDR mentality that we've been practicing for a number of years, how we best position the portfolio as a whole for long-term growth. There are a lot of aspects to that, that relate almost exclusively and directly to the operating platform, but there's some of that, that is on the investment side where we need to be redeploying capital out of what we believe to be slower growth investments and in the higher growth investments, and so that's exactly what you saw with Sonae Sierra Brazil's announced dispositions in the latter half of the year. And so I think you take that capital out of nonprime assets in that market. And for Sonae Sierra Brazil that, that largely is getting then reinvested into a couple greenfield developments that we have underway and in lease-up today. We're also evaluating acquisitions in that market, but that's certainly a challenging endeavor down there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Truxillo with Bank of America.
Thomas C. Truxillo: Just a simple question first. Do you think you will accomplish those leverage goals you laid out in the 5-year plan in the next 1.5 years, given that if you give yourself credit for a run rate of EBITDA that would be consistent with recognizing a full year of your acquisitions? And then two, if you do accomplish that goal, given the work that you guys have done in improving the portfolio, a greater percentage of prime assets, large or unencumbered asset base, much better balance sheet, do you look at those metrics and compare yourselves to your higher-rated peers and think that you'll continue to move up kind of the credit rating spectrum?
David John Oakes: The first one, will we accomplish the goals we've outlined? Yes, we will. I would like to give a more conservative answer, but Dan gave me a dirty look. So I think we can be very clear on that one. As we built back credibility over the past couple of years, an important part of that has been telling people what we were going to do and then executing on it, not changing that plan, not deviating from that, not explaining, here's why it was hard or this is what changed. So I think we want to absolutely indicate that we continue down the path that we've outlined. That includes the improved balance sheet, the improved portfolio quality, but also growth to the bottom line that you'll see more going forward, and so I think we believe all that's achievable. And to the second part, yes, we absolutely comp ourselves to more higher -- more highly rated peers. We even further comp ourselves to the best of breed aspirational sort of peers in the industry as a whole. And I think we've tried to be clear in our investor presentations that we're not done yet. We're proud of the accomplishments over the past couple of years, but we're not done yet. And we do consistently reset those goals internally to make sure that we're challenged to continue to improve. So I think for a long time, the story was very clear and simple that we needed to get back to a consensus investment grade rating on our bonds. Having achieved that, it certainly doesn't mean we're done. We do think over the next several years that there are additional steps to that. I think Moody's positive outlook on our investment grade rating with the potential to move that a notch higher is a clear indication of that. And we continue to look to make more progress on our leverage metrics and hope that those fixed income investors as well as the rating agencies recognize that and reward that with further upgrades over the next several years.
Operator: I would now like to turn the presentation back over to DDR management.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you very much for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you with our first quarter results.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
20,SITC,1,2013,2013-05-01 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Janet, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday, this release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Over the past several quarters, and most recently in our year-end review report, we have openly articulated our aspirations to earn blue chip status in the REIT space and in the market generally. According to the New York Stock Exchange and notwithstanding the requirements of market capitalization, a blue chip is a corporation with a national reputation for quality, reliability and the ability to operate profitably in good times and in bad. As a management team, we continue to execute our strategic plan, and our focus remains on building and maintaining a high-quality organization that delivers consistent and compelling results across all business segments quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. Our shareholders can expect quality and reliability, and with continued performance and discipline, we are confident our strategic direction will lead to achieving our goals. Now that we are a quarter into the year, I would like to address what the market can expect from DDR today and going forward. Operationally, the market can expect us to not only lease more than 10 million square feet and raise occupancy, as previously guided, but to do so with minimal CapEx while raising rental rates, achieving true organic growth and not playing the role of subordinate lender to retailers. CAM charges will increase below the rate of inflation in an effort to operate more efficiently and give our tenants room to breathe as we optimize our portfolio-wide occupancy cost ratio and focus on the opportunity to raise rents. Financially, the market can expect us to continue to de-lever by growing EBITDA while funding acquisitions with discipline and primary consideration given to NAV accretion, although we realize that FFO cannot and will not be ignored. Capital allocation decisions will continue to be evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis with consideration for alternative and best uses of our shareholders' capital. In that regard, I'm pleased to announce that our 900,000 square foot power center development in Charlotte, anchored by Walmart and Ikea will open 100% lease this summer, is on plan to generate an unlevered cash on cost return in excess of 10% and marks our first domestic ground-up development project in 4 years as we continue to carefully evaluate development opportunities on a risk-adjusted basis. Our proactive redevelopment in Pasadena that included the recent buyout of Macy's is another example of our efforts to enhance long-term NAV as our current redevelopment pipeline is also trending at a 10% unlevered cash on cost return. And our continued acquisition of prime power centers in top MSAs highlights our ability to creatively source attractively-priced acquisition opportunities, many of which have enhanced our efforts to simplify our story by reducing the number of joint ventures. Our capital recycling activity will remain focused on disposing of non-prime and non-income producing assets to fund future acquisitions of prime power centers. While we have successfully taken advantage of the mispricing of power centers over the past several quarters, we are beginning to see cap rates for our asset class tighten as more buyers see the value and stability offered by strong credit quality of cash flow from the retailers that continue to profitably win market share. As our cost of capital continues to compress, the market can expect us to remain active on the acquisition front, but primarily on off-market transactions where we have proprietary governance rights, minimal due diligence risk and where both our partners and our investors benefit from certainty of execution based on our familiarity with the assets. David will discuss this in more detail in a moment. With regard to the retail landscape, the market can rely on this management team to stay intimately involved in the continued evolution of retailers, their concepts and strategies and consumer trends and behaviors. We will continue to invest in our travel budget to ensure we are staying in front of our retail partners, understand their needs and growth aspirations and align our operations and portfolio to capitalize on these opportunities. Whether it be bricks and mortar, Internet or omni-channel, we are obsessed with the retail business and its evolution, and will continue to follow even closer than ever before. Organizationally and culturally, the market should continue to expect us to reward excellence based on performance, not simply tenure. Our organization has been built on merit and we will continue to place an emphasis on excellence as we recruit, develop and retain talent. We will remain very active in the industry via NAV and ICSC and involved in supporting our business as it relates to significant political issues like Main Street Fairness, FIRPTA and compressive tax reform. Regarding our communications efforts, we will continue to be accessible to both the buy side and the sell side for conferences, non-deal roadshows and personal visits, and our disclosure and transparency will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the investment community. We will continue to pursue social media opportunities and invite all stakeholders and constituents to follow us on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest and ddr.com where we provide fresh, crisp and most importantly, relevant content, that not only highlights our company but speaks to our business and the trends we are seeing in the market on a macro level. Additionally, we are cognizant of our obligation to corporate social responsibility and we have taken action to ensure our efforts are aligned with best practices and recognized by all key stakeholders. You can learn more about our corporate social responsibility efforts by visiting www.ddr.com/csr. Lastly, we continue to invest in technology to efficiently improve our relations and day-to-day interactions with our tenants. We are developing a tenant customer service portal through our website and our internal lease 360 program through Salesforce allows us to collectively understand a 360-degree view of the entire customer experience with each merchant in our portfolio. In summary, we continue to reach for blue chip status at all levels of the organization with every initiative in both our actions and results. We understand that such status must be earned over time and is predicated on consistent and reliable financial and operational performance and being a prudent steward of shareholder capital. At DDR, we are a progressive and forward-looking organization in all that we do, and we remain committed to achieving our stated goals for the benefit of all stakeholders. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. Over the past 4 years, we have leased over 40 million square feet of space to high-credit, best-in-class retailers dramatically improving our portfolio of tenant mix and credit profile and contributing to significant gains in our leased rate and same-store NOI. As a result of the progress we've made, one might think there is less obvious vacancy remaining in our portfolio and there is. But strong platforms don't need obvious vacancy to produce continued gains. When you review our embedded organic growth, driven by an improved leased rate across the portfolio, continued improvement in deal spreads, a higher retention rate, our ability to purposely create vacancy through downsizings and lease terminations and the advantageous supply and demand dynamic, the story gets even better. These trends and market conditions, when combined with our platform, will result in occupancy gains and organic growth similar to the stellar numbers that we have achieved over the past few years. And with the continued improvement in asset quality and the integration of recent acquisitions, these results may exceed prior performance. Starting with our embedded growth, as discussed on prior calls, our 94.4% leased rate is a forward-looking metric. Within this 94.4% is 1.2 million square feet of currently signed but not yet rent-paying leases, which doesn't include renewals or new leases for currently occupied spaces that will vacate in the future. So based on current leasing velocity, we are very optimistic about our ability to add to our leased rate. Over the past few years, we increased our leased rate by 160 basis points and fully expect to achieve a comparable increase over the next few	years. Occupancy gains through lease-up is the most obvious opportunity for future organic growth, and importantly, we will achieve this improvement in leased rate through an equal amount of lease-up in our big box and shop space. If the economy continues to grow as projected, it may even be possible to exceed expectations, particularly in the shop space category. Some of you have expressed concern that our box space of greater than 10,000 square feet is currently 97% leased, leaving no room for improvement in this important category. Please know that we confidently expect to achieve a leased rate of least 98.5% in this category, representing over 1 million square feet of new rent-paying space, and it is important to note that pricing power in the market resides within the 10,000 square foot plus units, which enhances the growth prospects for this portion of the portfolio. Similarly, our shop space of units less than 10,000 square feet is approximately 86% leased. We have increased the leased rate in this category by 130 basis points over the first quarter of 2012 and that gives me great confidence that we will achieve a leased rate of over 90% in this category. This million square feet of new rent-paying shop space will be a result of lease-up, fewer move-outs and the consolidation of space for a variety of aggressively growing retailers such as Shoe Carnival, Five Below, Carter's, Ulta, Tilly's, Rue21, Vitamin Shoppe and others. Deal spreads are another key component of the story. Just as we've turned the negative spreads of a few years ago to positive new deal spreads of 10.7% at 100% and 11.9% on a pro rata basis in the first quarter, we expect continued improvement in new deal spreads. Recapturing and marking historic leases to today's growing market ramp levels clearly provides yet another opportunity for continued organic growth. While new deal spreads continued to improve, so do our renewal spreads. This was evidenced by our first quarter results where we achieved renewal spreads of 7% at 100%, and again, even better on a pro rata basis at 7.5%. This marks our highest renewal spread in over 4 years and is a great indicator of future rent per square foot growth. With limited existing quality space available, retailers are more concerned about losing a store than we are about getting a space back and retailers are unwilling to sacrifice long-term sales growth for short-term savings by relocating based on deal economics alone.  Sales and margin will always drive a good merchant's decision, not real estate economics. In addition to the improving renewal spreads, we're projecting a year-end retention rate of 90%, up from the low 80%s of just a few years ago. As renewals require no downtime or CapEx, this stabilized cash flow set the basis for growth while providing the opportunity to re-tenant where we deem appropriate. Further illustrating the confidence retailers have in their business and their unwillingness to give up quality real estate, 60% of our first quarter renewals were comprised of tenants exercising an option, which is up significantly from 40% just 3 years ago. Furthermore, 75% of our total renewals for 2013 are already complete. With this strong retention rate, we're able to take a more strategic approach to leasing by recapturing target spaces to purposely create vacancy and re-merchandise centers with higher credit best-in-class retailers. There are a variety of ways in which we're accomplishing this. First, we're pursuing termination opportunities with dark or poorly performing retailers resulting in termination fee income and re-tenanting at higher rents per square foot while creating additional traffic and strong co-tenancy for additional leasing opportunities. For example, we replaced FYE with Dick's Sporting Goods in 2 Salt Lake City location, replaced Books-A-Million with Cost Plus in Charlotte and replaced A.C. Moore and a local furniture operator with T.J. Maxx and Golfsmith in Greensboro. As the supply and demand metric continues to favor the landlord and our tenant open-to-buys continue to grow, we expect these profitable re-merchandising opportunities to accelerate. Additionally, we continue to meet regularly with retailers on downsizing opportunities, resulting in a more profitable, rightsized merchant paying a higher rent per square foot, plus the benefit of residual space, which we can mark-to-market. We are currently discussing downsizing opportunities with all 3  office products retailers and are making exciting progress in that area. While it is difficult to quantify the amount of square footage that downsizings will ultimately represent due to the ongoing re-merchandising plans of some of our tenants, we are committed to aggressively pursuing all opportunity in executing this strategy. In summary, from a growth and revenue perspective, we are very excited about all that we have accomplished including the improvement to our portfolio quality and the current leased rate, but we are far from finished. Our operating platform, coupled with the various growth prospects I've outlined, collectively enhance our ability to deliver organic growth, similar to the impressive numbers delivered over the past few years. Given our strategic initiatives and a more positive macro environment, there is the potential to exceed. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $86 million or $0.27 per share for the first quarter, 13% above last year. Including non-operating items, FFO was $82.5 million or $0.26 per share. Non-operating items were primarily the noncash write-off of financing cost related to the refinancing of our unsecured revolving credit facilities and secured term loan as part of the maturity that occurred in January. We are pleased to continue to upgrade the quality of our portfolio during the quarter with the acquisition of attractively-priced prime assets located in major MSAs and the disposition of non-prime properties and non-income-producing assets. The prudent funding of investments continues as well, which has significantly advanced our objective to improve the balance sheet. We will continue to lower our cost of capital by extending duration, improving our fixed charge coverage ratio and lowering leverage, while also growing EBITDA through portfolio lease-up and external growth, primarily off-market acquisitions and select redevelopment and expansion of our prime shopping centers. We were net acquirers in the first quarter as we purchased 2 prime assets for $81 million in the major markets of Dallas and Oakland, expanding relationships with high credit quality retailers such as Walmart, Whole Foods, T.J. Maxx and PETCO. Our joint ventures continue to provide an additional pipeline of unique acquisition opportunities as well and, in late April we acquired our partner's 85% interest in 5 prime power centers located in the southeastern MSAs of Atlanta, Tampa and Richmond for $94 million. We have managed and leased centers for over 6 years and this low-risk investment was funded primarily with proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of $45 million of common shares in April. The 5 prime power centers totaled 1.3 million square feet are currently 98% leased and are anchored by national credit quality tenants such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Home Depot T.J. Maxx, Ross, PetSmart, Michaels and Fresh Market. We have now acquired 9 prime shopping centers valued at $450 million from joint ventures since the beginning of 2012 as our proprietary pipeline of JV assets continues to be a key source for acquisitions, as well as an attractive and efficient means to liquidity for our partners. These recent acquisitions will not be encumbered by mortgage debt and are now included in our high-quality unencumbered asset pool.  Annualized NOI of the unencumbered asset pool has increased to a significant 13% from the first quarter of 2012. Net investment activity has been funded with proceeds from asset sales, as well as new common equity. During the first quarter, we accessed ATM program and issued 2.3 million common shares in an average price of $17.57, generating gross proceeds of $40 million. Including April, we have issued 4.8 million shares of common equity for $85 million in 2013 to fund our acquisitions. We do not take equity issuance lightly and are very aware of its high cost. And we would only consider further issuance if the investment was attractive enough to justify it. We continue to sell non-prime assets during the quarter with $46 million of dispositions amounting to $35 million at DDR's share. We currently have $83 million in non-prime assets currently under contract for sale, and this very active capital recycling strategy has significantly improved our portfolio and enhanced the credit quality of our cash flows. During the first quarter, we continued to opportunistically access attractively-priced long-term debt, closing $1.2 billion of consolidated financings as we proactively refinanced our credit facilities and secured term loan well in advance of maturity. These refinancings advanced our objectives to extend duration, lower the cost of capital and reduce secured debt. The new $815 million unsecured revolving credit facilities and $400 million secured term loan mature in 2018 and pricing was reduced by 20 basis points on average.  At the end of the quarter, our weighted average consolidated debt duration was 5.2 years, a significant improvement from 4.3  years at the end of 2011. Looking at future capital needs, we have less than $1 million in consolidated maturities and only $23 million of our share of unconsolidated maturities remaining in 2013 and no unsecured maturities until May 2015. We also issued $150 million of 6.25% perpetual preferred equity in early April, 25 basis points below the 6.5% preferred equity issuance in July of last year. The proceeds were reused to redeem $150 million of our 7 3/8 preferred shares. While the lower rate will provide significant annual interest savings in future years, the overlap between the issuance of Class K shares and the redemption of Class H shares results in little of this benefit being recognized in 2013. We continue to project 2013 operating FFO per share of $1.07  to $1.11, which at the midpoint represents 6% growth over 2012, one of the strongest expected growth rates in our sector. While we are happy with the earnings outperformance this quarter, we also acknowledge it is very early in the year and we are not adjusting guidance at this time, as we continue to monitor operating performance, transaction timing and size and capital market opportunities. We remain focused on EBITDA and NAV growth through the lease-up of our portfolios, selective redevelopment and development opportunities and off-market acquisitions. We are confident that improvement in these metrics, combined with our significantly improved balance sheet and lower cost of capital, can create considerable incremental value for DDR shareholders. At this point, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Samit Parikh with ISI.
Samit Parikh: Dan and David, your recovery ratio and NOI margins have really improved year-over-year and continue to sort of move up. And the CapEx is really remaining low right now. Can you sort of just explain how you feel those will move going forward for the remainder of the year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. I would certainly agree with you that we've seen improvements in that recovery ratio. And I think it is very important to note there are a lot of these items that we'll talk about each quarter in terms of improving portfolio quality, higher credit quality of cash flows, but the question then comes up, how does that actually flow into results? And it doesn't happen immediately, but I do think it's exactly why the improved trend you're seeing in those ratios has occurred and is sustainable on a go-forward basis. It represents the sale of non-prime assets that usually have lower or declining recovery ratios, it represents the acquisition of higher quality assets with higher occupancy and with better credit quality of cash flows. And so you do see a sustained improvement in those metrics that doesn't happen immediately when those transactions are made, but over time, as those results flow into our overall operating results, you'll certainly get that improvement in recovery ratios that is reflective of portfolio quality. It's also reflective of the continued lease-up that we've had that certainly benefits those results, as well as overall, just a landlord-favorable environment, where we have been able to put less CapEx into deals and yet it still generated record leasing volumes and industry-leading leasing volumes. And so I think some of the metrics you highlighted are particularly important because they aren't the top headline metrics when you think about the focus that gets paid to a same-store NOI and the focus that gets put on re-leasing spreads, but a lot of these improvements in real operating stats, lower CapEx, lower bad debts, higher recovery ratios are extremely important to the overall economics of deals and the overall economics for our portfolio. And we do think this improvement is sustainable going forward and we do you think there can be more to come on those items.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I was wondering if there was any more news on the DDR Blackstone group acquisition of 7 shopping centers?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Craig, we -- as you know, we continue to be active in the market. And we have a terrific relationship with Blackstone and we are pursuing that opportunity with them. Lots of things can happen in these transactions, and which is why we have hesitated to announce anything historically until it's closed, particularly in the markets -- in the market that we're in today. But I think it's safe to assume that because of our relationship with Blackstone and the fact that the assets in question are prime power centers, that we absolutely have interest and we are pursuing it in conjunction with Blackstone in a structure similar to the structure that we established with them last year with the EDT acquisition.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with Morgan Stanley.
Paul Morgan: You opened with talking about your aim to be a blue chip and I had a kind of follow-up on that. Where do you think kind of among all those different elements, the biggest gap where DDR is right now versus the blue chip group that you're looking to join? And is there anything you're looking to do to narrow that gap on an accelerated basis, whether -- I don't know, whether you think it's kind of the non-prime share of your portfolio or your leverage or other factors? Or is it really just something that's going to have to take time and there's really no way for you to accelerate it?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. I think you're exactly right, Paul. I mean, the way we accelerate is by performing on a consistent basis quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, and it's very difficult to accelerate it otherwise. Now, there's some absolute blue chip companies certainly in our mind that have very extensive non-prime portfolios, but yet, they still perform on a very, very high level and on a very consistent basis. So I think with us, it's time. I think the market has appropriately looked at DDR as a show-me story and that we needed to prove a lot in regard to our strategy and then the execution of the strategy. I think we've come a long way in doing that. But I do think it will take more time for us to achieve that status. And I think it's not an operational metric as much as it's -- or any 1 operational metric. I think it's giving good guidance, it's delivering on what we say we're going to be delivering, it's being a prudent steward of shareholder capital over an extended period of time. And I think it -- you sort of merge into it. I don't think -- I think it's a process. I don't think it's an event. I don't think you wake up one day and you say, ""Geez, we're blue-chip and the market thinks we're blue chip."" I think it's going to happen over time and we're very focused on that and -- which is one of the reason why we're so disciplined in our approach to our strategic plan and we're very careful on how we articulate the message to the market because we just don't want to disappoint. So I think time will help us and obviously, in that period of time, our consistency of performance would be the quintessential element, I think, in order for us to be successful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Just had a question. As occupancy in the portfolio continues to rise here, I guess the space that's left to lease is a little more challenging space to lease overall. And Dan, you mentioned that we should expect to see lower CapEx in the future, and this quarter, I recognize it's just one quarter, but we've seen net effective rents for new leases down relative to 2012, both landlord work and tenant allowances are up slightly. But this space is more difficult to lease. Can you just help reconcile the view that landlord CapEx will decrease? I would think it might go the other way?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Todd, this is Paul. We feel very good about how we controlled CapEx on our new deals and will continue to. You're always going to see a little volatility, a little fluctuation quarter-by-quarter based on the deals that are made. It's important, when you look at that net effective rent page in the supplement, to understand that we're trying to show the spread, really, if you will, between the starting rent and the net effective rent, which continues to be pretty tight. Again, always going to be fluctuations. But if you look at a lower net effective rent, the net number this quarter really is a function of lower starting rent and that clearly goes back to the type of deals that are made. If you're making more box deals in a quarter, you're going to have a lower starting rent than more small-shop deals. So we feel very good about it. You should expect to continue to see some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but we have it under control and the trend is absolutely in our favor.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill.
Andrew Schaffer: So I was wondering, given the strong open-to-buy tenants and the shortage of box space, I was wondering if you can comment on the competitive nature of these tenants introducing bidding wars for the space. Or if this -- are these open-to-buy numbers are just traditionally well over availability?
Paul W. Freddo: There's clearly more competition and we've been talking about that really for about the past -- almost 2 years now, Andrew. Back 4 years ago, I was very clear in mentioning that if somebody came and there was a taker for space, we were all for it unless the filled space couldn't afford any more vacancy. That has -- that's done a 180. There's a lot of competition. It doesn't always have to be similar lines of business for the retailers either. You may have a hardlines retailer competing with a softlines retailer. And that's exactly what we're seeing though. There's -- these guys while they are being very careful about how they talk about their open-to-buys and their commitment to the Street to meet those open-to-buys, there's clear competition. And that's clearly what's driving the new deal spreads and what we see continuing to drive it for the next couple of years. We've talked a lot on these calls about how the limited new development that will be done will not have any significant impact on these dynamics and that's still the case today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Quick question about the acquisition that were made during the quarter, especially the buyout of your partners. Was that portfolio already at 98% leased? Just kind of curious what the potential upside you see is on those assets?
David John Oakes: I think, for those specific assets that we have managed for 6 years, there's a good story about what we've accomplished in the venture over the past few years to get the occupancy that high. But in line with Paul's comments earlier, we still certainly look at highly-leased centers as still an opportunity, not just a risk of losing that. And so we're pleased that with our partner, we were able to generate considerable lease-up in that portfolio, but obviously, because we're acquiring them, we do think there's more to go over the next several years as we see opportunities to increase rents, and increase NOI in those centers.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think one of the things also to keep in mind, even at centers that are 97%, 98% leased, and we see this all the time, is that there's always opportunities in good real estate. That's why the quality of the real estate is so important on these acquisitions because we do have downsizing opportunities, we do have tenants that will leave. Do we have tenants that will leave? We don't even know who they are yet, but they will. And you really don't have a hard time backfilling that space and the mark-to-market opportunities are pretty exciting. So whether it's a consolidation of small shop space because tenants come and go over time, or downsizing of boxes and just making sure that the retail community knows that we are creatively looking at ways to expand some of those assets and to increase the NOI, good things happen to good real estate. And I think this is going to be another example of that.
David John Oakes: Yes. And if we would have been buying a 98% leased portfolio from a third party, I think there's a little more credence to the comment about a concern about downside versus upside.  But this is a situation where we've known these assets for a long time, and I think gives us extraordinary confidence that Dan's exact comments are what we can experience over the next few years as we see potential further opportunities even in a portfolio that's highly leased like this one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: You've made good progress on the sale of your non-prime assets over time, yet -- and I realize they only represent about 10% of the portfolio in terms of NOI. But when I think about the number, it's still 1/3 of your assets. And Dan, you were talking about making a point, kind of a show-me story, making a point to the Street. Is there some reason you can't accelerate the disposition of that portfolio? Is it debt-related? Is it JV partnership-related, something like that? Or is there some way to, I guess, drive that forward faster?
David John Oakes: Yes, there are a few reasons, several of which you mentioned, Rich. And I think first, the perspective overall that's important to have is we have sold dramatically more than anyone in this sector. Over the past several years, we have done the overwhelming majority of that through one-off transactions, which can be slower at times or less press release-worthy but we believe do end up with better execution. On the specifics of what's left in terms of the non-prime pool, you're exactly right. There are some wholly-owned assets that are tied up in debt pools that make that a challenge or make it economically unattractive to sell even if you'd like the underlying asset pricing. There are other penalties that go along with that. There are a number of assets in joint venture where it's simply not our decision. However, we do have some very thoughtful partners that have seen an improving pricing environment today and certainly are more active in pursuing the strategy we've talked to them about for a while, in liquidating some of their non-prime assets. And so the portfolio we bought in April was accompanied by a number of assets that we will not be buying that are going to market. And so we expect to continue to make progress on that metric, but not in a massive portfolio fashion. More in the measured pace that we've gone about where you can continue to see progress every quarter, but not just looking to do the massive portfolio deal. We are encouraged by the sale environment where an improving CMBS market is particularly important for the sale of non-prime assets, which is generally how those are financed. And as you get a more and more attractive and aggressive CMBS market, I think it only makes the environment more receptive to off-selling assets and so I think you'll continue to see us active on that front, both on a wholly-owned basis and within our joint ventures.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Also, I think some of the larger numbers, too are the single-tenant assets, and that -- and we do have some term issues there. It's very difficult to sell assets today to a leveraged buyer who have with less than 10 years of term left on the lease. We have a number of single-tenant assets in the 6 to 7 year, some even fewer than that, and these are assets that are doing extremely well. So your faced with a question, do you go and ask the tenant to renew their lease early, which will cost you a lot of money? Or do you just hang in there knowing full well that they are going to exercise their options and they are going to renew the lease and then make the property immediately saleable? So those are discussions we have all the time, Rich. But the asset, it's a large number of assets but they're often very, very small assets, rather relatively insignificant asset. And as we -- as you noted in your comment, represents roughly 10% of our NOI and declining each year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason White with Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: I was just curious when you look at acquisitions, what role do demographics play? And do you have a threshold where you need to clear certain level demographics or is it really just part of the mosaic that drives you to make an acquisition or to turn one down?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, demographics are absolutely a part of the consideration. They're not independent of all the other factors including performance of the asset, tenant sales, population trends, things of that nature. But the demographics are a decent sanity check. The problem with the demographic reports that we see on a consistent basis is they take the ring approach not the market share, not the trade area approach. And when you look at centers that are typically our size, it's easy to draw a ring and say this is the trade area, but if you talk to the tenants and you ask them what their trade area is, it's extraordinarily different. No retailer just draws a circle. That's why while we provide a retailer with some demographic information, they typically ignore it. I mean, I could tell you, and I'm sure Paul will confirm, we were on the department store side of the business, it was very of developers to show us demographic reports and trade area reports, but we absolutely ignored them and did our own. Because the retailer knows the market better than anyone who's just drawing rings. So while demographics, I think, are interesting, and I think they're a good sanity check, they don't you a great story in a lot of cases. We can point to an awful lot of very, very, very good centers where tenants make a lot of money in a light demographic area, and we can also point you to a lot of terrible, terrible centers in very high demographic urban areas or suburban areas. So it really is on a case-by-case basis. In other asset classes, it's not the same. In multi-family and residential, even in office, it's very different. It's very different. Demographics tell a much clearer story. But we have so many diverse retailers who have so many proprietary trade areas and they know who the consumer is and how they reach their consumers. And that -- it's a nice sanity check, but it doesn't drive necessarily the decision because if it did that, you'd buy a lot of very, very bad assets in some high demographic areas. And a lot of people are doing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quentin Velleley with Citi.
Quentin Velleley: Just with the positive commentary on fundamentals, occupancy heading to 98% on the box space and growing market rents and pricing power, firming cap rates. How far are we from more widespread development across the market? And how should we be thinking about this cycle versus the prior cycle?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That's a great question, Quentin, and we get it. People intuitively assume that when you have the situation we're in now with the supply and demand metric and just the open-to-buys continuing to grow, that one would think that development's going to become more prevalent. But it just hasn't for a number of different reasons. Number one, in our particular sector, on a risk-adjusted basis, it really doesn't make sense to take development risk when you can buy at the cap rates we're currently buying at. So that's something that is -- it won't  last forever, but it's something we should take advantage of while we can. The one thing that people have to keep in mind about the development is that unlike other recessions where we came out the other side and there was massive cooperation from municipalities who were looking for tax revenue, we're not seeing that now. There are obviously some exceptions to that rule, but the entitlement process today is still incredibly burdensome. It takes an extended period of time, it takes a massive amount of risk capital, I mean millions, not hundreds of thousands, of risk capital and in many cases, you may be forced to buy land that's unentitled. And that's not something that we're interested in doing and I know it's not something that a lot of folks in our sector are not interested in doing. The risk of buying unentitled land today is very, very high. So even if the numbers work, even if the numbers work on a risk adjusted basis, they may not be more compelling than redevelopment or acquisition, and being a prudent steward of shareholder capital, we have to pursue those other opportunities. So I think you're going to see some new development like, I mean, the deal we're doing in Belgate's great and we have a few others that we'll look at, but it's not going to be enough to move the needle and alter the supply and demand dynamic from the existing assets.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Tayo Okusanya.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Yes. This one is directly for Dan. Dan, earlier on you made a comment during the call about a potential to exceed, and you're a man who chooses his words very carefully. So I was just curious what you meant by that and where you saw the opportunities to actually exceed guidance.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, I think there's a number of things going on in the market. I mean, if -- we have a lot of tailwinds right now in our sector. And while we're very cautious, we beat our FFO projection for the first quarter, we beat our same-store NOI projection for the first quarter. And if things continue, we think that there's going to be opportunity for us to show more improvement in those areas than we had previously guided. But it's early. But it's early. And while I think it's -- we just gave guidance in January and while first quarter was better than we had anticipated being and we don't see a particular slowdown in the second quarter, we will wait and see what happens. Because we think that in a very fluid economy like we're in today, that being prudent and having some discipline is important. That being said, if things continue to go the way they're going, we clearly have the opportunity to exceed our expectations in small shop leasing, and that's something that could move the needle to some extent. But we will wait and see and we will give more direction on that after -- at the second quarter call.
David John Oakes: And you've heard it from us many times. It's a long-term focus, it's not a pure focus on 2013 FFO per share. And so there are times, and some of the initiatives that Paul talked about earlier with downsizing and with improving tenant quality, that it could be actions we take on that actually caused some pressure on '13, and everyone would agree it's the right long-term thing to do, which is absolutely our focus. But we do want to make sure we have the flexibility to make the right long-term decisions. And aren't just held to 1 specific year of FFO.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We've also -- we said in an earlier time, I mean, we would be disappointed if we only met our guidance on acquisitions, and we're almost there now based on our annual guidance for acquisitions. So we will exceed, I would hope, our acquisition guidance. But again, I don't want to put us in a position where we have to do done deals in order to prove a point. So we will continue to pursue things the way we're pursuing them, but we're very close. We're very close to exceeding our guidance in acquisitions, and I'd be disappointed if we don't exceed in that area for 2013.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wigginton with DISCERN Securities.
David L. Wigginton: Dan, you mentioned in your remarks about the cap rates for you asset type tightening. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a sense of the magnitude of tightening, maybe on a year-to-date basis, and whether that's accelerated over any period of time or if it's been just a gradual tightening. And then maybe comment on potentially where you kind of envision the cap rates going from here. If you've kind of tightened as much as we're going to tighten or if there is more tightening ahead of us.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, I think for quality assets, Dave, we have seen 50, 60 basis points of tightening over the last 6 or 7 months. And I think there's a number of reasons for that. One is I do think we were mispriced. And markets are too smart to let that happen forever. And I also think that the -- if you just look at retail results and the credit quality of cash flow, who's gaining market share and who's losing market share, our asset class is pretty attractive. It doesn't have a lot of the pressures that some of the other asset classes have, and people are recognizing that. For example, just the last 2 weeks, I've seen 2 different offerings for funds to buy power centers where people are out trying to raise capital to buy power centers, 1 of which, I think, is pretty far along  and 1 of which seems to have some positive momentum. I haven't seen that in years. I haven't seen that in years. So there's more capital clearly looking to chase the credit quality of the cash flow that power centers represent and, I think, the flexibility that power centers represent, because tenants do come and go. And one of the things about power centers is they've proven to be incredibly resilient, and occupancy levels, while they did fall, are right back to where they were and will be at peak levels if not exceed peak levels, in the not-too-distant future. So I think people recognize that. I think a lot of people -- no one could argue that the superior investment in A malls and people, I think, have done that. I think a lot of people are looking at the traditional grocers with some concern. But then you look at the specialty grocers and you get very, very excited. And the specialty grocers are the people that are coming for our centers. So as power centers are establishing themselves as a destination for specialty grocers, now all of a sudden you go from just being mass merchandising to mass merchandising and grocers. So I think it's just a much more attractive investment from a credit perspective, from market share perspective, and if you look at balance sheets, clearly from a profitability perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo.
Unknown Analyst: I'm just following up on NOI growth again. Obviously for the first quarter, it came in above the guidance range for the year. And in the guidance you said that it would be second half-weighted. So I guess I'm just kind of curious to know, should we see it accelerate at this point as we head into the second half or was there something that was pulled forward a bit? I was just wondering if you could give us any color on that. And then I guess it relates to the move outs, which was why the expectation was supposed to be lower in the first half. And did you just not see those yet? Or was there, again, some type of delay?
David John Oakes: Sure. Your point is a good one, both on the outperformance for the quarters, as well as a better-than-expected move out and bankruptcy situation for the first quarter of the year. So I think that really did drive better performance than we had budgeted for the first quarter. We still see a situation where the latter part of the year, the fourth quarter particularly, will be the strongest quarter for same-store NOI. And you'll see an acceleration, to that point, in the interim. Based on the way our budget looks today and our experience today, we'd expect second and maybe even third quarter to be slightly lower than what the outperformance led us to in the first quarter. But still, we're encouraged by everything we see. We're in a situation where I think we continue to be a bit ahead of budget on those metrics and we'll continue to update you as we do get further into the year and have greater confidence on how the whole year looks. But what we're standing by today is noticeable outperformance from less move-outs and bankruptcies in the first quarter and some of that flows through to later in the year. But we'd still say the next quarter or so will be a little bit slower. And again, as we mentioned earlier, some of the best opportunities for us for long-term value creation might involve lease terminations, downsizings  and other actions that could actually create a little short-term pressure. But again, long-term significant opportunity to create value.
Operator: And at this time, we have no further questions. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
21,SITC,2,2013,2013-08-02 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2013 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded, and now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. As I mentioned on our previous calls, our goal is to provide reliable financial and operational performance by leveraging a strong operating platform focused on quality assets and being a prudent steward of shareholder capital regardless of the economic environment. Even though the last few months have been choppy on a macro basis, we are achieving our stated goal of operational consistency and reliability. Not only do our second quarter results underscore the stability and strength of our portfolio, but when looking back on our historical operating results and trends, this story is even more conclusive. I'd like to take a moment to share with you some statistics. We have enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters of leased rate gains, 13 consecutive quarters of positive blended leasing spreads and 10 consecutive quarters of blended leasing spreads greater than 5%. We've also enjoyed 13 consecutive quarters of positive same-store NOI growth and 12 consecutive quarters of same-store NOI growth of 2% or greater. Importantly, in regard to tenant demand for prime assets, we have posted 17 consecutive quarters of leasing volume in excess of 2 million square feet. We pay particular attention to leasing volume and the CapEx associated with such volume since it provides an excellent barometer of market trends and prevents any single deal or corresponding CapEx from artificially skewing the numbers to the positive or the negative. Therefore, when you have leased 44 million square feet over the past 17 quarters as we have, it obviously tells us the story. From the transactional and financing perspective, the consistent execution of our capital recycling program has led to 16 consecutive quarters of growth in the percent of NOI generated by our prime portfolio, helped greatly by 18 consecutive quarters of nonprime assets sales and 8 consecutive quarters of prime power center acquisitions. As we continue to opportunistically access the credit markets, we have decreased our weighted average interest rate for 6 consecutive quarters. And while we maintain a conservative payout ratio to provide flexibility for external growth opportunities, we have increased or maintained our quarterly dividend for 15 consecutive quarters and have continually left plenty of dry powder for future movement. Simply put, amid the marketplace noise and speculation about potential headwinds, our results have been reliable and consistent. While we are pleased with the results of the quarter and encouraged by the longer-term trends, we are not surprised. We will continue to execute on our strategic objectives, and we are obsessed with delivering consistent and reliable guidance and results while capitalizing on market opportunities in an effort to provide sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders. At this point, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our view of the potential impact of the few macro factors that have been dominating headlines lately. Over the past several weeks, there's been considerable chatter regarding the interest rate environment and what it means for REITs as well as the consumer. The market's initial reaction to the Fed's comments regarding tapering led to increased volatility in the capital markets, and there's now also speculations that consumer spending may be softening based on recent monthly retailer sales reports, primarily from tenants that specialized in the ready-to-wear category. First, in regard to potential modest interest rate increases and what it means for our business, the reality is that an increase in interest rates for the right reasons, namely economic growth, is not a threat to our business. In fact, it is a positive for the retail sector. Retailers have been operating in a price neutral to price deflationary economy for as long as we can remember and would benefit greatly from a reasonable inflationary environment. While rents per square foot within the current environment continue to climb, the growth could be more substantial with modest inflationary pressure since rent as a percent of occupancy cost is calculated by using actual or projected sales which would benefit from an inflationary lift. The challenge, of course, is defining the level of which inflation is positive versus the line that crosses into negativity. However, based on recent trends, we have plenty of room to benefit before the retail environment becomes overinflated. Second, in regard to retail sales ratings, it's important to note that the vast majority of retailers no longer report sales on a monthly basis and, therefore, the monthly information that is available is no longer a reliable barometer for broader performance in the sector. Retailers have become masters at highlighting the weather, calendar shifts or inventory initiatives as elements have impacted the store monthly numbers to a level that question relevance. Moreover, it would be shortsighted to draw any conclusion about consumer demand based on the seasonally low summer sales months, coupled with a very conservative inventory environment. Back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons are fast approaching, and it would be unwise to lead to conclusion prior to witnessing the sales trends during the peak seasons. And lastly, with regard to recent volatility in the Capital Markets and REIT share prices, it has had absolutely no impact on the fundamentals of our business. And as you can see, it is not reflective in our operating results. So our results continue to be consistent and reliable as we aggressively execute our plan and pursue our management and investment thesis. And while there is considerable market volatility that persists, our product continues to prosper and many of the perceived negatives within the market may actually be beneficial and further fuel our positive performance. I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. As you saw in our earnings release last night, we achieved another quarter of consistent momentum in operating results driven by strong deal volume and corresponding growth and leasing spreads without the need to buy the growth with excessive CapEx. While I will not waste your time recapping the metrics outlined in our press release which obviously speak for themselves, I would like to bring your attention to an important trend developing across our portfolio. Contrary to prerecession trends where our portfolio was dominated by joint venture assets that were predominantly of higher quality than our wholly owned bucket, the portfolio has now flip-flopped and the dominance of the wholly-owned bucket is now driving the business. Our wholly-owned portfolio has transformed into high-quality, largely unencumbered prime power centers that remain in peak demand from growing retailers. This crossover is seen by looking at a number of statistics but most striking is that our combined pro rata leasing spreads in the second quarter were 8.6% as compared to the overall spread of 7.9%. This 70 basis point lift enjoyed by the wholly-owned portfolio represents the reversal of historic trends and is our third consecutive quarter of pro rata outperformance. In addition, when the previously announced acquisition of 30 power centers from Blackstone closes, 75% of our overall portfolio GLA will be wholly owned, up from 55% just 3 years ago. With full control over a significantly larger percentage of our portfolio and the further significant improvement of our quality metrics, we gained both additional leverage and further negotiating flexibility when dealing with our retail partners. As a result, we expect the wholly-owned operating story to continue its outsized growth going forward. Given this improvement in the quality and control of our portfolio, the current supply-and-demand dynamic in the sector and the overall retail climate, I would like to address our leased rate going forward and a significant amount of organic growth that remains. With our increasing quality and control, we are confident that a full occupancy level of 96.5% is achievable, leaving almost 200 basis points of additional growth through lease up and even when that number is within sight, we will continue to proactively create growth opportunities through terminations, downsizings and consolidation of space. This opportunity continues to be fueled by a landlord-friendly supply-and-demand dynamic and those rare retailers that struggle to remain relevant to the consumer in a very positive market. Retailer distress, no matter how limited, when combined with our quality portfolio on leasing platform continues to create value-add opportunities within prime assets that we aggressively pursue on a regular basis and add considerably to the growth story. For example, with Toys ""R"" Us and Babies ""R"" Us, over half of our contracts are ground leases with rents, typically 50% to 75% below markets. We are currently in the process of recapturing 2 Babies ""R"" Us locations and replacing them with Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy and Gap outlet with rental increases between 100% and 370%. In each case, not only are the economics are attractive, they dramatically improve the tenant lineup, NOI, credit quality and obviously, the overall value of the assets. In regards to Barnes & Noble, we are currently in a position to recapture 14 of our 25 locations over the next 24 months. As you know, Barnes has great locations in our portfolio with all of them being in prime centers that average 98% leased. The list of retailers interested in these assets includes Bed Bath & Beyond, Nordstrom Rack, T.J. Maxx and Sprouts Farmers Market to name a few, and we anticipate rental increases between 30% and 50% with very reasonable CapEx. As for the office supply category, we've completed or finalizing downsizing the 10 locations. While individual results vary, we are achieving rental increases of 60% on the residual space, 20% on the downsize space and have secure 10-year terms with the now rightsized office-supply retailer. More importantly, we maintain close dialogue with both OfficeMax and Office Depot regarding a post-merger strategy for their locations in our portfolio. While the merger is not final, we are confident that we will recapture up to a dozen locations, many of which will include termination fees paid by the tenant and additional mark-to-market opportunities. It's important to note that of the 12 locations targeted to recapture, all are in prime assets. These are just a few examples of the opportunities we see for currently leased space. Good things happen with good real estate, and with the continued improvements in our overall portfolio of quality, I'm extremely confident in our ability to continue to add value beyond the obvious lease up of vacancy and further expand the organic growth story we have seen over the past 13 quarters. Finally, I know Dan will speak about our Investor Day in a moment. But rest assured, we will have numerous members of our leasing team in attendance and available to discuss the trends I just mentioned or any others that may cross your mind. I encourage you all to join us and feel free to ask questions about whatever interests you regarding the leasing, development and retailer environments. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $86 million or $0.27 per share for the second quarter, 8% above last year. Including nonoperating items, FFO was $80 million or $0.25 per share. Nonoperating items were primarily related to redemption of our Class H preferred shares. We're extremely active in the capital markets in the second quarter, as we raised over $1 billion to fund the acquisition of prime shopping centers. We raised $784 million of common equity and $300 million of unsecured debt at a yield-to-maturity of 3.4%, representing the lowest unsecured nonconvertible bond rate in the company's history. We also issued $150 million of 6.25% perpetual preferred equity in early April, 25 basis points below the coupon on our preferred equity issuance in July of last year. The proceeds were used to redeem $150 million of our 7 3/8% preferred shares. Given the strength of the capital markets, we were compelled to over-equitize our first half 2013 investments to make sure we were well positioned for more volatile markets. The prudent funding of recent investment has led to the continued improvement of credit metrics, and our balance sheet advancement is now well-recognized by all of the major rating agencies, which most recently -- which was most recently exemplified by Fitch's upgrade of our bonds to investment grade. Despite meeting our strategic objective to reach consensus investment grade, we will continue to take steps to lower debt to EBITDA, extend duration and improve our fixed charge coverage ratio in order to further enhance our credit rating. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average consolidated debt maturity was 5.4 years, continued improvement from 5.2 years in the first quarter and significant expansion from the 4.3 years at the end of 2011. Looking at future capital needs, we have no maturities remaining in 2013 and no unsecured maturities until May 2015. We continue to upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the acquisition of attractively priced prime power centers located in major MSAs. Our joint ventures continue to provide a pipeline of unique acquisition opportunities as we acquired our partners' 85% interest in 5 prime power centers located in Atlanta, Tampa and Richmond that we have managed and leased for over 6 years. This low-risk investment was funded with proceeds from asset sales and the issuance of $45 million of common equity in April. The 1.3 million square foot portfolio is 98% leased and the centers are anchored by national credit quality tenants such as Walmart, Target, Costco, Home Depot, T.J. Maxx, Ross, PetSmart, Michaels and the Fresh Market. As previously disclosed, we are also under contract to acquire our partners' 95% interest in a portfolio of 30 prime power centers from our existing join venture with Blackstone for $1.46 billion. The acquisition was funded with $739 million of new common equity, $146 million of proceeds from preferred equity and mez loan repayments, $398 million of assumed mortgage debt with a weighted average duration of 4 years and $300 million of new 10-year unsecured debt. The 95% leased portfolio of prime power centers primarily located in top 40 MSAs totals 11.8 million square feet and features top tenants such as T.J. Maxx, Kohl's, PetSmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Dick's, Old Navy and Lowe's. And these acquisitions will provide us the opportunity to further simplify our structure by reducing our joint ventures by 20% and enhancing EBITDA quality through the conversion of shorter-term fee and interest income in the longer duration, property level cash flow with strong growth potential. These transactions will convert approximately $26 million in fee and interest income in the long-term property NOI with growth potential, enhancing our net asset value. Additionally, 26 assets will be added to DDR's high-quality unencumbered asset pool, increasing the NOI of this pool by over 15%, the highest level on our history. We anticipate that the Blackstone transaction will close in the fourth quarter. Subsequent to second quarter end, we also acquired 2 prime regional shopping centers in Orlando and Atlanta for an aggregate $259 million. The assets are 99% leased and enjoy average trade area household income of $82,000 and population of 382,000 people and have weighted average rent per square-foot that is approximately 15% greater than the prime portfolio indicating the highly desirable and dominant shopping centers. Winter Garden Village is a 1.1 million square foot market-dominant regional power center in Western Orlando that features high credit quality tenants such as Target, Lowe's, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Best Buy, Ross, Bed Bath & Beyond, Sports Authority, Staples, PetSmart, World Market, Old Navy and Ulta. In addition to already being one of the top power centers in all of Florida, Winter Garden Village will also benefit from additional traffic in future years as Florida Hospital has purchased 58 acres adjacent to the shopping center for the construction of a medical campus. Cumming Town Center is a 300,000 square-foot prime power center in Northeast Atlanta. The assets sits in close proximity to Cumming Marketplace of 650,000 square-foot, power center also owned by DDR, allowing us to further dominate a strong Atlanta submarket. The fully leased center features, Dick's, T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, Best Buy, Staples, Old Navy and PETCO. Both assets were acquired from a strong DDR relationship were a certainty of our execution in a short timeframe allowed for the purchase of 2 high-quality assets. These 2 acquisitions were funded from excess proceeds from a large equity issuance in May, the assumption of mortgage debt and recently closed and in-process asset sales. Our capital recycling activity remains robust on a disposition side as well. We sold $64 million of nonprime assets in the second quarter and have an additional $138 million of nonprime assets currently under contract for sale. Since the beginning of 2008, we've sold over 175 wholly-owned nonprime operational assets. And as a result, the remaining inventory of lower quality assets has shrunk considerably. To address the smaller amount of nonprime candidates for disposition and the continued desire and opportunity to recycle capital in the high-quality assets, we have reallocated internal resources to form a portfolio management department that is tasked with underwriting the portfolio to, among other things, identify the lowest tier of prime assets for future sale. This process now enables us to further upgrade portfolio quality by formally distinguishing and disposing of those centers that either lie in suboptimal markets, exhibit low growth over the medium term or carry greater risk due to tenancy or location. Regarding guidance. Operating results have exceeded our expectations for the first half of the year, and we now feel that it's appropriate to raise our guidance for same-store NOI from 2% to 3% to at least 3% growth. In addition, operating transactional activity year-to-date encouraged us in May to raise our guidance for operating FFO per share to $1.08 to $1.11, implying growth of over 6% from 2012 at the midpoint. We remain focused on the lease up of our portfolio, redevelopment and selective development opportunities and off-market acquisitions which continue to provide any of the accretion and EBITDA and dividend growth in excess of our peer group. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. And before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the Investor Day we will be hosting on Thursday, October 10, in Charlotte, and let you know what you can expect from the event. We have been actively soliciting feedback and suggestions from several of you regarding expectations for a productive, efficient and interactive Investor Day format. As a result, the day will not be overly scripted. You will have full access to our deep and talented senior management bench and you will see firsthand how we've allocated capital to create value in the Charlotte market over the past 22 months to creatively sourcing acquisitions and discipline development. The start -- the day will start with brief management presentations and updates to our strategic plan from David, Paul and myself, but will also include the involvement of our Chief Investment Officer, Mark Bratt; our Executive Vice President of Capital Markets, Luke Petherbridge; our Senior Vice President of Finance, Matt Lougee; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Operations, Joe Tichar. Additionally, we will have an interactive panel discussion with our Chief Accounting Officer, Christa Vesy; our Senior Vice President of Leasing, Bryan Zabell; our Senior Vice President of Retail Partnerships, Bill Kern; and our Senior Vice President of Development, Chris Erb; and our Vice President of Capital Markets, Scott Henderson. During this panel, you will have full access and the ability to ask any questions you would like. After the panel discussion, we will tour our recent acquisitions and recently completed development project in Charlotte and conclude the day with a cocktail hour and dinner during which you will have unlimited access to our entire management team. And it's been our experience that the less scripted the event, the more informative it is for you, and providing you the opportunity to pursue your thoughts directly with our team is our goal. We are proud of the team we have assembled and will ensure that you have the opportunity to meet and interact with the folks that run the business on a day-to-day basis. We look forward to seeing you in Charlotte in October and welcome your additional suggestions regarding format and content for the event. At this point, operator, I'd like to open up the lines for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Just a question on property tax. In the apartments, especially with folks with a lot of Sunbelt exposure, they have been talking about some pretty healthy double-digit property tax increases. Curious what you guys are seeing on the property tax front and if you think that some of these increases may be outpacing the tenants' ability to absorb them?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, we haven't seen any major issue at this point on the property tax side. I think it's important to note that this is always a trailing analysis just in the way that the taxes are reset. And when you think about the significant hit that property values in the shopping center sector took versus the extreme resiliency of the multifamily sector, I think you can see why in a lot of markets even though realtime data would indicate very strongly that property values are increasing, the trailing numbers that municipalities are looking at in resetting values is generally much more favorable for our ability to keep property tax as low. So we're not seeing anything significant on that front. We take an active approach internally to make sure we're appealing that on a very regular basis to lower taxes which really just benefits our tenants that eventually should benefit us. But we take an active approach to try to keep those costs as low as possible, and I think you see that show up all-in extras, whether it's CAM or taxes and what we pass through to our tenants.
Operator: The next question comes from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: When I look at the average size of the shopping centers in terms of dispositions versus acquisitions, they're almost 3x as large for the acquisitions. I know you've spoken in the past about the greater opportunity for value-add on these larger centers of redevelopment. I'm just wondering is there a sweet spot range that you look for your community shopping centers to be that sort of help aid that process of redevelopment?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, historically, Craig, we want to remain -- we want to be flexible and obviously, it depends on what the story is whether it's a core assets or a core-plus asset or a value-add asset, a lot will depend on how we look at it. But if you really go back and take a look, we have significant control and significant flexibility and value-add opportunities. We like to see 200,000 to 250,000 square feet of owned GLA. That has been something that is always been sort of in the back of our minds, something that we've looked at as a good number. It's not a hard and fast number, but it's a good sanity check when you want to deal with what is the relevance of your asset in any given market. Obviously, the smaller the asset, the less relevant it is. So at 200,000 to 250,000 square feet of owned and as typical on the retail sector, you always have anchor stores whether they be department stores, off-price stores, home improvement stores that add another a couple of hundred thousand square feet at least to those centers. We can get up to 400,000 or 500,000 square feet in total. That seems to be a good number on the relevance scale for what we're looking to do and how we're looking to proceed. One of the things we like, obviously, about the asset class and the size that is -- we talked about it as the flexibility. And when you see centers that are 700,000, 800,000 square feet, typically what comes with those is 70, 80, 90 acres. And those 70, 80, 90 acres give you a lot of flexibility to be nimble in a very fluid retail environment. So your observation is not by accident. We are absolutely focused on larger centers. They give us maximum flexibility and greater value-add opportunity and have a more impressive cumulative average growth rate going forward.
David John Oakes: And what you see in the supplement doesn't even capture all the activity, given that the Blackstone transaction that has a number of extremely large centers has not closed as well as the 2 additional assets that I mentioned, that average. About 700,000 square feet apiece, and so I think you'll only see that spread accelerate in the second half of the year as we sell more smaller assets and we've made great progress at acquiring some much more significant assets in terms of their critical mass and tenancy as well as land for future opportunity.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Just curious with regard to the investment environment, there seems to be a lot of product available, and you've certainly been acquisitive both from third parties and from within the joint venture portfolio. I was just wondering how large is the company's appetite here and what do you think the ideal size of the company is, long term?
David John Oakes: It's really driven opportunity by opportunity, whether it's the constant flow of packages you get from brokers or where our greater focus is the off-market sourcing of activity through relationships that we have. We're not focused on -- this is how much bigger we need to get. We're obviously very focused on making sure we grow prudently. I think we, along with much of the sector, but DDR is a standout some ways, learn some very important lessons about prudent due diligence and prudent growth and we are very much wedded to those concepts. So we will cast an extremely wide net in looking at a broad set of acquisitions. But there's no need on our part to grow the most recent acquisitions. The 2 that just recently closed were 2 extremely high-quality centers, one that we knew well in a submarket of Atlanta where we already have a presence and one that really is one of the absolute best power centers in the entire Southeast, the Winter Garden Village in Orlando. And so I think for assets like that, we're going to be very active but price is important. So we need to be able to make sure that the pricing works for us, both on going-in basis as well as on a growth over the next 5 to 10 years basis. And so there is a considerable of focus on the opportunity to improve the portfolio of quality further and make additional investments, but there's no need. We certainly think we are large enough by a significant factor to be very relevant to retailers. We are large enough by a considerable factor to be relevant to investors. And so we don't have to get bigger, but I do think as we've outlined over the past year or so, we do still see an opportunity where in general, power centers are more attractively priced than other types of shopping centers. And so we have been active in selling some smaller products, some single tenant products and grocery-anchored products and just some smaller market products and reallocating that into select acquisition opportunities. And there've been a few that we've been excited about, and we've been blown out of the water by the pricing but there have been announcement that we have been able to secure some very high quality new assets. And I think you'll see, unless pricing gets much more aggressive, we'll continue to be active on that front but very prudent in both underwriting and funding.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think the other thing that's important to note, Todd, is if you really look to what's happened to the company over the last several years, we've gotten smaller, but really in the retail community, we've gotten more relevant because the quality of the assets have gone up. So I think from our perspective, David's right, I mean there's a certain size I think you need to be, to be relevant to retailers. We've long since passed that. But as the company has actually gotten smaller, we've become more relevant with retailers because of the asset quality improvement and the ability to provide growth opportunities for growing retailers. So I don't think there's a right number how big the company should be or shouldn't be at this point in time. But I do think there is a right type of asset that we should own to remain relevant, and that's what we are very focused on.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from UBS.
Christy McElroy: Just sort of following up on the growth question, longer term. At your last Investor Day in 2011, you talked about long-term same-store NOI growth for your portfolio in the 1.5% to 2% range. As you've obviously seen closer to the sort of 3% to 4% range in the last couple of years, I'm wondering if that longer-term outlook has changed sort of in terms of the ability for your portfolio to generate growth over time, and especially as your portfolio has changed?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, yes. I mean, we have -- we do have a different view of that because if you'll recall, the last Investor Day, Christy, there were a lot of execution -- there's a lot of execution risk and our ability to get the type of portfolio we wanted to put together. There really was no guarantee we've been able to sell the bottom tier of the portfolio which was obviously a growth drag, and there was no guarantee that we would be able to afford to acquire what we wanted to acquire in order to substantially increase our growth profile. Today, as we look at our portfolio, obviously, when you get the full occupancy which is nowhere near at this point, as Paul mentioned, it's going to have an impact. But today, today, we're very comfortable in the 2.5% to 3.5% same-store NOI growth range for the foreseeable future. Not only is that because of the lease-up opportunity, but because of some of the consolidations, determinations, the buyouts that we're doing with tenants, some of store closures, some of the downsizing. So all those things are adding to great growth opportunities. As you know, we don't include redevelopment on our same-store NOI numbers although they do end in the numbers from a results perspective. But we do -- we are in a position where we have a much higher quality portfolio. The demand dynamic is still way out of whack as far as demand and supply. So we are driving the rents. And we're very comfortable being at a 2.5% to 3.5% going forward when we were at 1.5% to 2.5%. But it was a very different company back then and it was a very different portfolio. I still think if we have that portfolio, we would still be in that 1.5% to 2.5% range. But thankfully, we do not and we can comfortably look at more robust growth going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ki Bin Kim: I just had a couple of question regarding same-store NOI. First, was it -- how is it impacted by Brazil? Second, if you had the Blackstone assets fully consolidated, what would that same-store NOI results look like? And last question, you mentioned about looking at occupancy cost as -- looking at rent as a percent of total sales for retailers. I know it's hard to get the sales data from the nail salon small shop tenant, but given that a lot of your tenants are the big national public companies, do you -- have you tracked the stat on what that occupancy cost looks like and maybe how that can trend going forward?
David John Oakes: Yes. The couple of items regarding same-store NOI. First, for us, it is important to note that we do spend a lot of time trying to make this a true same-store calculation. And so we do have certain clear rules that we adhere to. And also, this is a cash calculation, not GAAP. So you give up something from that. We do spend a considerable amount of time separating what is simply a re-tenanting from what is a major redevelopment. And generally, that's define by amount of CapEx that we've spent on it. And so we do think we have a very legitimate and credible calculation. And also one that just passes that simple sanity check of you report 3% same-store NOI growth, then you get to 6% FFO growth for the year, 8% FFO growth for the quarter. Then I think it sort of passes that sanity check that it has to eventually flow to the bottom line if it's a legitimate calculation. If we did include the redevelopment activity, it would be significantly higher at least 100 basis points. Regarding the specific items on Brazil, given that Sonasier [ph] Brazil hasn't reported yet, we can't say anything too significant on their specific results for the quarter. But the impact on DDR's results was extremely insignificant in the 10-basis-point range of benefit. And so no real impact at all from that standpoint. A few years ago, 2010, '11, it was a much bigger deal. You were talking about mid- to high teens in Brazil and 1% in the U.S. and you got a much greater contribution. Today, it is extremely insignificant in terms of its impact on that number. The Blackstone portfolio is not at all reflected in the numbers, not even our 5% because if you recall the requirements to make it truly comparable we're in a position where we had owned 0% stake in that portfolio looking back 1.5 years. And so we just don't have -- or didn't think it was appropriate to include comparables staff even for the sub-equity stake that we had. On a go-forward basis, those assets next year will be and -- or in the next few quarters will be in and will be a driver. Over the trailing 12 months, including the Blackstone assets with the considerable lease up that happened in that portfolio, that would have absolutely driven same-store NOI for DDR. Overall, up 25 basis points or so just because there was considerable mid- to high-single-digit growth within that portfolio. And so that certainly would have helped, and I think will help going forward, but was not in the results this quarter for our definition of the term. And finally, on occupancy cost, you're right to say that we don't have the results from everyone and it's not even just the nail salons or some of the locals. Honestly, we get it from a decent amount of those guys. It's the nationals that have the market power oftentimes to not have formal reporting requirements and percentage rent requirements. But whether we get the sales formally or because of our relationships, we get them informally, we do have a pretty good view on where occupancy cost is today in the high single digits, 8-ish percent range from what we're aware off, and we absolutely think there's room to grow that noticeably without impacting retailer profitability.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I'd like to add with something on the occupancy cost David hit on. There's a couple of ways to look at it in terms of our portfolio, we are right about 8% and clearly, we could be north of 10%. So there's room. And I think that's the key when you look at occupancy cost and where retailers are today, specifically the winning retailers, there is absolutely room. There's a broad spectrum of occupancy cost that are sustainable by the different retailers we deal with. But very few of the retailers we deal with are stressed or at those levels where we see no more room for growth. You have to look back, I think, prerecession, rents, et cetera and occupancy cost. These guys wound up losing money on those rents. They've made better deals over the past few years and we've seen them climb back close to prerecession levels. But there's no stress that we're concerned about. I mean, obviously, there is some select retailers that have -- that are struggling that have extraordinarily high occupancy cost and they are a problem. But overall, there's clearly room to grow the occupancy cost in our sector.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: [indiscernible] occupancy targets, 96.5% over time. Just curious, your spreads have been very consistently positive for quite some time here even -- particularly on the renewal spread side of things. And just curious how you're balancing as you get closer that 96.5%, how do you balance the... [Technical Difficulty] the spread?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Vince, I'll answer what I think we've got. Clearly, we see a consistency of the spreads going forward and it's particularly the renewal spreads, we're going to see that high single-digit that we've talked about for several quarters and we've seen consistent growth from that and that's not going to change. You got to get right back to the supply-and-demand dynamic that we've talked about all the time. There's extraordinary growth in the retail business and incredible lack of new supply, and that's what's going to drive it. So my concern is we get closer to the 96.5%, you're going to see us do some very proactive, take some very proactive steps as we continue to improve the quality of the portfolio. I talked a little bit in my script about some of the space we look to recapture. We're going to do that at significant improvements in spreads. So we're going to see consistent double-digit in the new deal spread and high single-digit in the renewal spread, even as we get closer to the 96.5%.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital.
Richard C. Moore: It seems that it's in vogue recently to bail out of Brazil. And I'm curious if you guys can give us an update on what you're thinking about Brazil and your whole investment there?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, as you know, Rich, Brazil has been a great investment for us. We've done extraordinarily well. The climate has clearly changed. The operating assets continue to perform at a very, very high level while the development program has crawl to a stop because the development projects have not produced at the level that we would have expected them to produce. So our development has slowed down, but we have 3 projects that we have to stabilize. And it's going to take us a little longer to stabilize those than we thought it would, probably an extra 12 months, that we'll be coming online and stabilizing. So when those come online and when they stabilize, we will reevaluate the entire investment, evaluate what we have going forward on an operating basis. We'll evaluate where we are and the value that we may be able to garner from the development pipeline and then take a look to see what's the smartest move for us to make in Brazil. I can't tell you -- I can't put dates around things because there was the reason why they call them emerging markets. They move very -- in a very volatile way, very quickly. And -- but we are in that market aggressively. We know what the opportunities are. We are comfortable what the opportunities maybe, and we want to make sure that we can maximize the value for our shareholders whether that's to stay, or whether that's to leave. But that's all on the table on a regular basis, and we continue to evaluate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan.
Michael W. Mueller: Just to 2014, does it still feel like you're going to be a net acquirer into next year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, it does. There's still product out there that we think is priced attractively. We still are very disciplined in how we look at that. We pass on a lot more than we acquire, but we have access to product to continually to our joint ventures even though that's declining to some extent, there still is plenty of product in that bucket that we have rights to and many of those assets, obviously, we're very fond of. So we do feel very comfortably that in 2014, we will be a net acquirer. That being said, we will continue to call the portfolio. As David said, we have a team of folks looking at the bottom tier or even the prime assets at this point in time because we still feel it's a very, very exciting time to recycle capital on our sector and we've been active at it, we've been successful at it and that will continue. So you will continue to see sales, but I think in 2014, we will also be a net acquirer.
David John Oakes: Yes, and I think you're likely to see the same trend you've seen the past couple of years. We're going to guide to numbers in January that we think are very reasonable and feasible, and then we will evaluate the acquisition market through the course of the year. We're obviously -- last year and this year, you've seen us massively exceed the acquisition guidance that we provided simply because we saw attractive opportunities and access to reasonable capital. So it's a constant focus for us.
Operator: The next question comes from Quentin Velleley from Citi. All right, the next question comes from -- I'm sorry, we have Quentin on the line now.
Quentin Velleley: Paul, as you head back to that 96.5% leased rate and presume more growth from terminating leases, downsizing and re-tenanting, can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about CapEx levels and economic trend for those kinds of circumstances?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, I don't see any dramatic change either way, Quentin. We're very pleased with where we are on a CapEx on a new deal basis. We are -- you're always going to see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter based on the character of deals made. But as we've talked time and time again about the net effect of rents, and we're very pleased with how we've controlled CapEx. We think we did a very effective job of that. I mean, if you look at that net effective rent story, just Q2 -- Q1 to Q2, significantly higher starting rents, slightly higher cost on a square foot basis but nothing significant, but a dramatically increase net effective rent if you look at the bottom line. There's nothing that we've been in aggressive mode of re-tenanting space for the last several years. And I think you can plan on seeing a very similar level of CapEx over the next few years.
Operator: The next question comes from Cedrik Lachance from Green Street Advisors.
Cedrik Lachance: Dan, you've talked in the past about some stores in your centers going to outlet tenants or outlet-type tenants. There's reports here in the local press that you're contemplating to turn your Long Beach center into an outlet center. How many centers in your portfolio could be turned in their totality into outlet centers, and what kind of timeframe can be put on that?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: My guess would be one. And it's the one that you mentioned. It's not really a -- that has been a distressed center for us for years, and we've had conventional retail in there that has come in, that's been leased a couple of different times but none of the conventional retail has been overly successful and in that particular case, we had interest from outlet tenants. We just opened restoration hardware recently that had a stunningly successful opening and that was the beginning of a thought process that we should be going out to find the compatible tenants to an outlets like restoration hardware and build from that and we've found good market receptivity to being in Long Beach and being at that center. But in general, we're very fortunate we don't have a lot of distressed centers. So we don't need to change the dynamic of the centers that we're in. In fact, while the outlet business is robust right now and obviously is doing great, we'd rather place some of the outlet tenants into our existing power centers like we're doing now, as Paul mentioned with Gap outlet, like we're doing with Nordstrom Rack, like we're doing with Saks Off-5th. They don't need to be in a pure outlet environment and our product type is very attractive to them obviously, because not only we're doing a lot of business but the occupancy costs are under control. So as a practical matter, there are very few -- I'm looking at Paul, but I can think of any other than the pipe that you mentioned that could be converted to an outlet center. And that was very few that we would even spend the time, effort or resources trying to do even if that were the case at this point in time. So we have -- we've completely transformed our portfolio and the portfolio is performing at a very, very high level. So when you have that rare opportunity to do something great. And let's face it, the only reason why the outlet opportunities are available to us in Long Beach is because it's California, the barriers-of-entry are extraordinarily high and we have space available. So even that is not a perfect outlet scenario. But at the same time, those tenants need to grow as well. They need to get into markets that they're currently not in and the pipe presented an opportunity. So I give credits to our leasing folks for being creative enough to pursue that opportunity. But the bottom line is you will not see a lot of that coming from us.
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, and I'll just say one other thing, Cedrik, about that location. Obviously, it's a very unique location and the only of its site in our portfolio which have been so heavily tourist-oriented, and then that obviously is something that works with an outlet concept. So that's the only one we're working on.
Operator: The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ki Bin Kim: A question on Best Buy. It seems like there's -- I know you've been working with them pretty closely to downsize your space or release it. But it seems like they've been a pretty vocal -- the new management team about their leases, like 75% of the lease is coming back to them within 5 years. And at least on their side they've been vocal that they've been -- they said they have leverage over landlords. I was wondering what is the current status of the Best Buy leases? And if the company is trying to downsize the space, do they -- are they paying penalties? What are the economics behind that and has that change all in the past year?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, there really is a downside discussion today with Best Buy and they've made that pretty clear. They've done some good things, by the way, as a company, right. We're less concerned about them than we were a couple of years ago whether it's Samsung, Microsoft initiatives, new leadership at the top, selling out of Europe. There's some momentum there. But I would tell you, I don't know how anybody thinks they have in upper hand when it comes to their lease terms and leases coming up for renewal. We feel very good about it. I could give you more than one example where we're ready to replace them, should they not take their option. I mean, that's the position we're in. We've been a good company focuses on real estate with retailers who seem to be at risk, and we've been focused on Best Buy's locations for a number of years and other at-risk retailers. And we're ready to move on these spaces, great locations and great prime centers. And as leases come up, we've got back up in just about every case. And so it's not going to be a leverage position for Best Buy. And again, we feel very good about it. But on the downsizings, they're more interested in fixing their merchandise mix within their stores, their entire business model, and downsizing is not an issue. We're ready. We initiated that conversation a few years ago and made a couple of deals and had some great downsizing stories. But we can downsize and we can make it successful, but they're not -- those conversations aren't happening right now.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, I mean, at the downsizing was the strategy of the last management team. And I think what you're hearing and we all have to be cognizant. There's always a disconnect. There's often a disconnect between what senior management on a retailer tells the retail analyst, and the what the real estate people actually are doing. Paul and I both came from that environment. So we've seen it firsthand. And while each time Best Buy is going out and said, we know we're going to use our leverage, we're going to downsize. We're going to do this. We're going to do that, nothing's happened. And it really hasn't happened, and it won't happen in this next cycle either, provided you have good real estate. If they're losing money and they have -- the store's too big and they're not doing well, then there's really no -- there's nothing that you could do that will keep them and that's what a good retailer will do. They'll leave bad locations. Fortunately, we don't have those and we're very confident -- we're very comfortable with what they're doing in the store right now which is improving the merchandising but we're also very comfortable in the desirability of their location should they decide to go elsewhere. We've tried. We've tried to get them to go elsewhere at certain centers. There've been unwilling to do so, and I don't think that will change.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jeremy Roane from Hilliard Lyons.
Jeremy Roane: I was just wondering if you could shed some light on the lease termination fees from this quarter versus the same quarter last year?
David John Oakes: Yes. The -- it's always a tough one to model because we've given guidance on an annual basis that it's going to be roughly in line with what it's been honestly, the past few years. Now the nature of some of that is changing because it's often times more proactive on our part than on the tenant's part, but you get to around the same number on an annual basis. So I think we would downplay the quarterly impact simply because some of the stuff is lumpy and completely understand that on your side of modeling, oftentimes line items like that just get spread across the year. But the reality for us is it does and up being a little lumpier than that. So in general, the mindset from us on terminations -- at a point in the cycle like the one where we're at today, where demand meaningfully exceeds supply that we have been more proactively having those conversations trying to recapture space, but it's -- for the larger ones, it's hit or miss whether you get 1 or 2 in a quarter or not or whether you got none. And so it does just end up being a lumpier line item. So I think we can continue to provide good annual guidance on it, but we obviously don't give quarterly guidance at all on any line items. And this is just one that's always going to be a little lumpy there where 2 or 3 quarters, 1 year we're going to miss on that number. And 1 or 2 quarters, we're going to exceed just because of the nature of that business where it doesn't just gets spread across the year the way our the model could do it.
Operator: There were no more questions. I would now like to turn the call over to management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, all, for joining us today. And again, we look forward to seeing you all at our Investor Day in October. Have good day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining."
22,SITC,3,2013,2013-11-05 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 3 2013 DDR Corporation Earnings Conference Call. My name is Patrick and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website. Last, we will be observing a 1 question limit. During the q&a portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As you know we recently hosted our Investor Day in Charlotte at which time we outlined and reiterated many of our long-term goals and aspirations. Highlighted our deep and talented bench of real estate executives, and toured recently acquired and developed assets in the local market. We were very pleased and appreciative of the strong turnout and I'd like to once again personally thank each of you that took the time to travel to Charlotte, and spend the day with us. It was our goal to present thoughtful content, provide unlimited access to our entire management team, and conduct the property tour that enhance the articulation of our investment theses, and how we intend to execute our stated goals and objectives. For those of you that were not able to attend Investor Day, we trust that you've been able to review the presentation materials and webcast that are posted on our website, and have since been in contact with our Investor Relations team regarding any questions you may have. The overarching theme of our strategy is a continued obsession with consistency and capital allocation. We will continue to articulate our long-term aspirations, and highlight the opportunities we are pursuing to deliver consistent and compelling results like you have seen once again this quarter. Given the abundance of disclosure over the past month, our prepared remarks today will be rather brief to reserve time for Q&A. Paul will address the growth levers we are pursuing on the operations side, and David will focus on the operating and transactional results of the quarter before we open the line up for questions. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thanks, Dan. As Dan mentioned, I will briefly highlight the leasing results for the third quarter before addressing recent activity in the portfolio that is consistent with the strategic growth levers we discussed in Charlotte. We posted another strong quarter with significant leasing volume, resulting in a 20 basis point improvement in the leased rate over the second quarter and 80 basis points year-over-year while achieving further improvement in leasing spreads. Despite a portfolio leased rate of nearly 95%, we leased over 3 million square feet during the quarter. We executed 210 new deals for 900,000 square feet, achieving a positive pro rata spread of 14.5% and 12.3% at 100% ownership. We also executed 233 renewals for 2.1 million square feet at a pro rata spread of 7% and 7.4% at 100% ownership. This represents our highest renewal spread in 21 quarters and is the continuation of a significant trend we're seeing in the portfolio. Combined, pro rata spreads for the quarter were 8.6% and 8.4% at 100% ownership, again displaying the continued outperformance of the wholly-owned portfolio which illustrates the impact of our capital recycling program and quality improvement. As for examples of the strategic growth leverage we are pursuing, the consolidation of small shops space continues to be a robust area of growth in our portfolio. At Commonwealth Center, a newly acquired power center in Richmond, Virginia, we recently finalized a new 10-year deal with Ulta which resulted in a consolidation of 6 formal small-shop units. This deal consolidated 3 chronically vacant small shop units and 3 units previously occupied by local, low-credit retailers with high turnover. We successfully consolidated these 6 units into a single 10,000 square-foot box and achieved a 100% increase in rent and recovery rate for the consolidated space, increased the credit quality of cash flow, outperformed our original underwriting, generated significant value creation, and introduced a great retailer to the overall merchandising mix of the center. Our continued proactive consolidation of small shop space has contributed to the improvement in our leased rate for units less than 5000 square feet by 110 basis points over the second quarter to 86.3%. Our long-term occupancy goal for this space is at least 90% but we will continue to reduce exposure to this category given its nature of lower credit quality tenants and high turnover. Naked leases and redevelopment were 2 other strategic growth levers highlighted at Investor Day that continue to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and considerable rent and growth through the proactive leasing of units occupied by tenants with no options, near-term lease expirations, and below-market rents. A recent example of these growth levers can be highlighted by activity at Brentwood Promenade in St. Louis, a 300,000 square-foot market dominant prime power center anchored by Target, Trader Joe's, Bed Bath, PetSmart and World's Market. We had a large-format jewelry store whose lease expired in January 2013 with no options and therefore no control of the space. With a prominent location adjacent to World Market, and a recently expanded Trader Joe's, we developed a merchandise plan that calls for the redevelopment of this portion of the center. After raising the 10,000 square-foot jewelry store, we constructed 19,000 square feet of new GLA, which is now fully occupied by Ulta, Carter's, and Lane Bryant. All 3 recently celebrated their grand openings within 9 months of the former tenants' expiration. The recapture of the jewelry store and redevelopment resulted in 3 new traffic driving retailers with strong credit profiles, positive comps, additional GLA, and ultimately, a 16% unlevered cash-on-cost deal. As highlighted at Investor Day, we have identified over 120 anchors in prime centers that represent naked leases, and mark-to-market opportunities. Additionally, given the evolution of the portfolio and continued flexibility exhibited by retailers, we have identified an additional $500 million of redevelopment opportunities. The small shop consolidation in Richmond and the recapture and redevelopment of the naked lease in St. Louis are just 2 examples that highlight the proactive approach we're taking throughout the portfolio to maximize growth. I remain extremely confident in our ability to drop -- to continue to drive significant organic growth through these various strategic levers. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. With operating FFO and FFO including nonoperating items from $90 million or $0.28 per share for the third quarter, a 4% increase in operating FFO over last year. Nonoperating items were primarily related to transactions costs that were offset by gains on land sales. In the third quarter and subsequent quarter end, we continued to upgrade the quality of our portfolio through the acquisition of prime power centers in large and growing markets with strong tenant demand, employment and population. We acquired 39 prime power centers of which the majority was sourced through our strong relationships with our joint venture partners. The prime power centers, which totaled 15.6 million square feet, feature high credit quality retailers and enjoy average trade area household income of $88,000 and a population of 494,000 people, more than 10% above the prime portfolio average. The average size of the 39 centers is 400,000 square feet and the average price with an excess of $50 million, further demonstrating our preference for large-scale market dominant power centers. As previously announced, we acquired a portfolio of 7 prime power centers in a newly-formed venture with Blackstone for $332 million in August. 2 market dominant regional power centers in Orlando and Atlanta for $259 million in July and 30 prime power centers from our existing joint venture with Blackstone for $1.46 billion at the beginning of October. The investments were funded with proceeds from the May common equity offering, and were payment of our preferred equity in mezzanine loans, the unsecured bond issuance in May, asset sales and assumed mortgage debt. Regarding asset pricing, despite the increase in treasury rates in recent months, we have seen little to no change in pricing for institutional quality power centers and we will continue to take advantage of cap rates that have yet to reflect the stability and credit quality of cash flows produced by high-quality power centers. In terms of the balance sheet, we continued to remain focused on debt duration and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average consolidated debt maturity was 5 years, a significant improvement from 2.7 years in 2011 and in line with our target of 4 to 6 years. In addition, we have over 90% of availability on our credit facility and we also continue to increase the size and quality of our unencumbered pool, which based upon conservative covenant calculations is over $5 billion in value today, a significant increase from the $4 billion at the end of 2010. We're going to future capital needs, we have no consolidated maturities remaining this year and no unsecured consolidated maturities until May 2015. We also continue to sell non-prime properties during the quarter with $138 million of dispositions, of which $104 million was that DDR share. Looking forward, we currently have $117 million of non-prime and non-introducing assets under contract for sale. As we outlined in our Investor Day, this aggressive capital recycling strategy has significantly improved our portfolio, enhancing the credit quality of our cash flows. Finally, with 3 quarters now complete and operating metrics generally stronger than expected, we're increasing our guidance for 2013 operating FFO to a range between $1.10 and $1.12 per share. At the midpoint this represents a 2% increase over the midpoint of original 2013 guidance and an 8% increase over 2012 actual operating FFO, which we feel is compelling and extremely competitive within the peer group. We will continue to remain focused on both NAV and earnings growth on further improving portfolio of quality while continuing to lower leverage and risk and above all else continuing to increase shareholder value. At this point, I will stop and turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I was looking at one of your recent acquisitions, Winter Garden Village and it seems like it had a really strong restaurant component, and then that got me thinking, how does management think about restaurants? I know they are a little bit more expensive upfront, but I am just wondering if they keep the consumer longer at center or how you think it fits in with your future redevelopments?
Paul W. Freddo: Craig, this is Paul. Restaurants are obviously a big component of centers such as Winter Garden, over 1 million square feet in a location where you clearly with the mix we have there, you want to keep people as long as possible. Some examples, the fast casual and casual are doing extremely well today. Restaurants such as Panera is another example of a restaurant we love to see at many of our centers just because it keeps the consumer there for long periods of time, so we're high on it. The high-end restaurants are struggling a little bit right now but the casual and casual are doing fine, and again with the center like Winter Garden, if you seen that, it's absolutely one that you need a few restaurants with the range of mix and retails we have at that center we clearly want to keep the customer there as long as possible. And from an financial and risk management standpoints, we're going to be following Paul lead on which restaurants make the most sense for a center but we're still going to err on the side of more often than not doing ground leases and so the significant level of improvements in some of those are someone else's risk and not ours and just what we think we can get the best risk adjusted returns, while still doing the right thing for the merchandise mix for the center.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samit Parikh with ISI.
Samit Parikh: I noticed basically year-to-date the net effects of rents were up just over 6% versus last year and it looks like for the quarter they were up nearly 15% versus the net effective rents on last year, so maybe could you just comment on sort of what, how you see the trend of rent growth going out next year on a CapEx adjusted basis?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Samir. We see there the rents obviously continuing to grow in a small high-single to low-double digit growth rate as evidenced by the spreads on the new deals but the net effect of rents deserves a little bit of an explanation. You have to be careful, the starting rent in the supplement is going to be of a function of type of deals made in the quarter. You may have some more back deals or some smaller shop deals which are going to vary. The key is to watch the spread between that starting rent and the net effective rent, and that's where we're focusing on. And what you seen in this quarter is where the cost associated with the individual deals came down dramatically. So I am more focused on that spread between starting rent and net effective rent. The starting rent is going to be very lumpy; you're going to see that fluctuate again just based on the carriage of deals over the quarter. All for all though you will see, base rents, starting base rents, continue to grow, as we live in this great environment of great demand and limited supply.
Operator: You next question comes from the line of Andrew Schaffer with Sandler O'Neill.
Andrew Schaffer: We have seen a lot of activity in office set with companies acquiring assets in the special services, I was wondering why there similar activity from the shopping center space and as we speak maturities lower roll '15, '16, '17, would you consider this as a potential acquisition pipeline?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, we've been very active trying to look as broadly as possible for unique, attractively-priced acquisition opportunities from the stuff that is closest to home where you have seen execute on a number of acquisitions from joint venture partners where the partners were looking to exit to doing exactly what you're saying in terms of scouring the universe of secured assets, scouring the universe of assets that are in the special services or about to be had special servicing but we really haven't had any luck, and I think your point is reasonable that you could save even more broadly for the retail space in general, at finding the stressed assets with special servicers that did represent an opportunity for us. I think one very important reason for that versus other property types is win an asset in our sector, does become somewhat distressed and then capital constrained and goes into that period of servicing, which oftentimes can take several years to get through. By the time someone can get hold of that asset, it's not simply a quality office building in a good location, it's 50% leased that someone can lease up. You really have found a situation where the asset might have become more distressed over time than that, because of the level of active management that this property type requires because it's not just a commodity sort of property and so for us while we looked considerably across many channels including special servicers and CMBS, we are all broadly, we really haven't found anything that we thought represented an attractive opportunity going forward. You could certainly find opportunities where you were buying something in a discount to what the value would have been a few years ago. But for us, in many cases the advantage we have in underwriting is the incredible amount of tenant feedback we can get, and we really haven't found tangible opportunities where we can get control of something quickly enough in a special servicing situation to be able to take advantage of that opportunity going forward. We have, in a few cases, helped private owners refinance assets by putting in a piece of debt where we can get an attractive return and, hopefully, control of the assets, but we haven't brought anything out of servicing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Yasmin with JPMorgan.
Unknown Analyst: I know you're still working on 2014 guidance, but any reasons to believe that your base case for acquisitions and dispositions will be that far from this year?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Our base case for acquisitions and dispositions will be exactly what we outlined in Investor Day earlier last month. While we always want to be aggressive in the market, we always want to look at what advantages are available to us, both on the acquisition and disposition side and we've never, not exceeded both our disposition number and our acquisition number since we've been given written guidance in the manner in which we have. We will still not put ourselves in the position where we feel the need where we have to buy something, we're compelled to buy something to make a number, or that we're actually forced to sell things that we don't think is right to sell given the cycle that we're in, in the market. So the numbers that we have presented throughout really the year, and most recently articulated during the October presentation is where we will be when we release our guidance in January.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Just a question, bankruptcy and bad debt has been very low levels generally, and I was just curious, as you look at the retail environment, what your expectations are around the holiday season? Maybe around post-holiday season fallout this year, based on some conversations driving with retailers. I guess the last 2 years or so has been somewhat more muted, and I was just wondering if you could comment on what you're thinking about what me might expect to see this holiday season?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, we expect the bankruptcy will be, continue to be mute, and we think the bad debt will also continue to be relatively insignificant, not just because of the health of the retailers but because of the improvement of the quality of the portfolio. We have had such an impact in our capital recycling program and upgrading the portfolio that bad debt as a percent to our total just continues to come -- go down as the quality of your portfolio continues to go up. Plus most of our retailers today, if you look at where they sit, their balance sheets are as strong as we've seen in sort of the modern era. They are -- they know -- they've learned how to do business in the tough low GDP environment and their balance sheets are as strong as they've ever been. Keep in mind that when it comes to bankruptcy, there are very few tenants who will declare bankruptcy during the holiday season because that's if you made it to the holiday season, you want to get through the holiday season and do your sales. So, if anything happens at all, it will happen after the holiday season, but we're not projecting anything significant based on our conversations with the retailers, analysis of the credit quality of our cash flow and the quality of our portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Pong of R. W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong: When going back to the acquisition environment, we heard a lot about how there is still a dearth of well priced core profitability available for the smaller grocery anchor community centers out there, you're trying to see some of your institutional competition that's typically been focused on those assets migrate towards more of the power center product, and if so do you see that creating any meaningful cap rate compression near term?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We've certainly seen over the past 6 to 12 months an increase in the number of institutions actively looking in at power centers. I still say there is disproportionate focus on other parts of retail, particularly Class A regional malls, as well as grocery-anchored community shopping centers, that they continue to be more in favor. But we have absolutely seen both pension funds, pension fund advisers and some in wealth groups more actively looking at power centers, so I think from a long-term opportunity to see compression in cap rates, that is a positive early sign but as we've seen in many cases, that community is generally slow to move, and so we're still seeing an opportunity selectively to acquire the highest-quality power centers around the exact investment pieces of finding larger scale centers in major markets where we can really grow NOI overtimes. We still see an opportunity out there but we certainly have seen some names participating in the sector that have not been around for many years, and so I think you are seeing some momentum to the exact theme that you referenced in terms of institutional capital looking more seriously at the sector.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Yes, just along the lines of the last question asked. Why exactly do you feel like sovereign wealth guys and private equity continue to remain somewhat hesitant to really kind of go all in on the power centers? What's kind of really holding them back, is it the tenant risk, is it like what exactly are they so concerned about?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think there are several things, and we've published the power center of investment theses book for the past year and a half or so to try to go through exactly some of that. And now, we've got a lot of those slides Incorporated into our other materials to highlight the true story about the power centers, I mean in the strength of the underlying tenants and the stability of the cash flows over time, but the institutional capital community consistently has been focused on trailing returns and trailing volatilities. So I think any change in their investment strategy is one that takes a considerable amount of time to see that actually occur and so that we're going to right now as you're showing quarter after quarter of extremely strong returns from power center tenants. You're removing some of the greatest risks in terms of certain headline tenants like a Best Buy 2 years ago where we were getting questioned constantly about the viability of that retailer that we consistently stood by during that period but it was one that I think stood out in investors minds as the concern for the sector that's now in a position where it is much better understood. And so I think these things just take a while to play out, but if you simply are looking at the retailers results, you're going to see not only the best sales results, the best earnings growth, the best inventory return, the best margins from the power center tenants. And so I think quarter-after-quarter, our underlying tenants show that the consumer is clearly voting and it shows up in the performance of the centers. When that translates into meaningful cap rate change in the private market, we can't tell you exactly but we certainly experienced changes in the past to be pretty glacial in terms of the private capital community.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: You did the 2 big transactions that you have with Blackstone and I realize there were some unique circumstance in there. But how do you view today joint ventures? I mean, are they really more of an intermediary for you guys like the Blackstone stuff that's kind of been or is there a long-term complement I guess to the joint venture strategy?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well Rich, as our history has been very checkered with joint venture. We had some very successful ones as of late but we had some stunningly unsuccessful ones in the past and we've learned from those mistakes. So as we look at where our joint ventures fit in, number 1, it has to be a very specific type of partner, it has to be a partner that is well capitalized, that is to truly aligned with the interest of our strategy, and one that brings something to the table that we don't have ourselves; namely, access to capital if we're are in the position where we need to access private capital. We would certainly undertake joint ventures where they bring us product that we wouldn't have available to us. The second, Blackstone joint ventures is a great example of that. We are very, very excited about that transaction, but that is not a transaction that we would've looked at, but for the fact that Blackstone brought it to us. So now we end up in again a joint venture with a first-class partner at the same time we end up with the first look at assets if and when it comes to time to get out of that venture, and you know that time will come. So it gives us an insider advantage if you will to manage and lease those assets for a number of years and it takes a lot of the risk as the due diligence process. So we'd like joint ventures if we need them. We like joint ventures if it's with the right person and the right entity. And we like joint ventures if they bring to us assets that we would otherwise not have an opportunity to acquire in the future. Where we don't like joint ventures is obviously where the partner fails our due diligence test, or where they're going to require us to cede the particular venture with prime assets. We had a lot of offers of folks that would like to joint venture with us on an institutional basis but they are requiring us to cede the venture with a series of assets from our wholly-owned prime portfolio, and that is not something that we're willing to do because we loose control of what we consider to be franchise assets. So we're not against joint ventures with the right person, but we're going to be highly, highly selective and we want to ensure that would the venture brings to the table is consistent with our strategic objectives and the types of assets that we want to own.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum: Can you give me a sense of where you think the occupancy cost is for the portfolio today, and maybe how that compares back to prior peak levels?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, we're just a little south of 9% now and at the trough we were down about 8%, and we think we can continue to grow this somewhere in that 10% to 12% range in our portfolio, but just south of 9% right now.
Ross T. Nussbaum: And where do you think market rents need to go before development really starts making more sense?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think it is important to keep in mind that one of the reasons why development doesn't make sense is not necessarily because of the market rents. There are situations where market rents where they do make a lot of sense, but across-the-board, on a risk-adjusted basis, if you look at the entitlement risk in particular, that preventing development from going forward even more so than just base rents. So I think you can have a very constructive conversation with tenants today, and I think rents can get to the point where something on paper would look somewhat interesting, but at the same time, your entitlement risk, the fact that you have to land bank with an uncertain outcome et cetera, just doesn't make that project competitive for your other capital opportunities particularly redevelopment. So if you take an look at where we can allocate capital today, whether it's just to lease or through the expansion of our redevelopment pipeline, where you have much, much less risk and you have much higher returns, development is just not competitive on a risk-adjusted basis. If you look at it on a pure numbers basis, you can get to a number if you ignore risk. But if you take risk into account today, it's development is not really compelling and it's not just because of the base rents, though our tenants are willing to pay the right rents to get to a decent return, that doesn't mean that the landowners willing to give you a long-term option and not require you to buy the land, and the land is not entitled. And there's no guarantee that the state federal municipals, the municipalities, local municipalities will cooperate with you. So if you take look back what happened in '07, '06, '07, in particular that's where people got into trouble, as where we got into trouble with too much land on the balance sheet, was you had to take too much risk. And right now redevelopment is much, much more compelling and I think that's why are seeing most of the capital allocators putting their capital into redevelopment and not new ground up development. So it's not purely a rent issue. It's a holistic issue, and it's an alternative capital investment opportunity issue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke McCarthy with Deutsche Bank.
Luke McCarthy: Just if you could provide a little bit more color on the consolidation in the small spaces, I'm just trying to understand the dynamics a little better there. So, in the $500 million of redevelopment opportunities you've identified, how much of that $500 million is the consolidation opportunity? And with those opportunities, kind of, what is the genesis of them, is it more the tenancy of stronger relationships you're saying, hey guys we want more space or is it more a function of you guys pruning your small shop tenant watch list?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: It's all over the place. Look, first of all in terms of the amount of the redevelopment spent that's devoted to consolidation, that's not a number we can put our fingers on. It's clearly a component of certain redevelopments. I mean, the redevelopments can include downsizing, consolidation of small shops, recapture of naked lease, whatever it is, but it's all part of a redevelopment process. I will tell you, on the small shops basis, specifically, which is where I think you're going with the question. It is usually the function of space. We know the demand, we know the demand because we're talking to the retailers who are seeking space everyday. And we're trying to figure out the best way to marry up that demand with space in our assets. And in some cases it's going to take some relocation of shops, some cases we're going to have some chronically vacant space. So there's no simple cookie cutter method of what we're doing with the consolidation but clearly we know as an example I gave in the prepared remarks in St. Louis, or in Richmond where we have some chronically vacant and some low credit quality smaller retailers and we've got a retailers such as that wants space that's where we're aggressively looking at the different ways we can consolidate the space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Christopher R. Lucas: Just a quick question on the, as you guys described the current positive supply demand dynamic, I was wondering if besides the growth in base rent, are there other lease terms that you're seeing swinging towards the landlord's favor base whether there be annual bumps or tenant rights or other things along those lines?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, Chris, it all goes with the demand for space and the lack of supply. But I'd will tell you the improvement in other than specifically rent-related issues over the past 5 years have been dramatic as we've seen improvement in core tenancy negotiations, in other requirements, exclusives, these are things that common sense as we hold more leverage in the negotiations where we're going to continue to clean up those clauses and we're making great progress. In terms of the bumps, also an economic issue, but again we're seeing improvement more frequent, specifically with the Junior Lancaster it'll be every 5 years but the percentage bump is going to be an negotiated item in every deal, and we're going to see improvement in that. And with the smaller shops we see more frequents, sometimes even annual bumps. So it's all working in our favor, and we're, the entire leasing team is driven to improve everything within those leases with every deal.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi.
Unknown Analyst: I just wanted to follow-up on the Richard's JV question, in terms some of your existing JVs, with $6.8 billion of asset unconsolidated, and you've pointed out that you had roughly 50% of your non-prime assets in the JVs. Can you talk about what the timeline and resolution of some of the stuff look like in the coming years, as you continue to sort of pare down your exposure on non-prime?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, the process of selling the non-prime assets within the joint ventures have at times taken in little bit longer, either because the joint ventures are almost exclusively capitalized with mortgage debt, so in some cases that's at that time line and in some cases it's just really cash flow requirements or desires of a partner where they are more interested in today's cash flow than what exactly might be the situation a few years out, and obviously we're working closely with our partners on all those. You had seen an acceleration in the sale of non-prime assets within the ventures, and you will see more of that. Like I said, some of it just relates to the maturity of certain debt tools that finally allows us to transact, and in other cases it's the partners timeline, but we're certainly very actively talking to those guys about our fundamental recommendations in terms of what assets are more likely to see challenges over time. And today, we do actively have assets been marketed for sale within every one of our major joint ventures as the partners have more recently been in agreements that there are good opportunities to sell some of those assets today rather than sit with some of the risks for future years. And so acknowledge exactly what you say is the progress on the unconsolidated site, has been slow. There are some good reasons for that but you're absolutely seeing more progress today and you should expect to continue to see that in 2014.
Operator: There are no remaining questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to the management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Once again thank you for joining us for another earnings call of a very strong quarter for DDR and we look forward to continued momentum and talking to you next quarter. Have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
23,SITC,4,2013,2014-02-13 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2013 DDR Corp. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Glenn and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today Mr. Samir Khanal, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please, proceed.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and filed with the SEC. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Samir. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to start today's call by reiterating that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and 2013 results. And even more pleased with our 2014 guidance and 15% dividend increase. These results would not be possible without the continued transformation of our portfolio through active portfolio management and capital recycling, a robust and strategic leasing and redevelopment platform and prudent capital allocation and balance sheet management. 2013 was another year of continued progress and achievement towards the goals and objectives contained within our strategic plan. We creatively sourced and acquired over $2.3 billion of prime assets on a one-off basis as well as through larger portfolio transactions, while opportunistically raising and allocating shareholder capital. Operationally, we generated same-store net operating income growth of 3.3%, signed over 1700 leases, achieved blended leasing spreads of more than 8%, and transitioned premium tenants such as Nordstrom Rack, Whole Foods, LA Fitness and Five Below into our top 50 tenant roster, while achieving consensus investment grade ratings. 2013 ended on a strong note and the momentum has accelerated into 2014. As announced in our 2014 guidance press release, we are expecting another year of operating FFO growth north of 7%, driven by continued improvements in operational metrics and strategic capital allocation. 2014 will see the continuation of our efforts to actively monitor, and participate in market opportunities as we pursue the creation of long-term shareholder value on a risk-adjusted basis. In spite of the obvious operating momentum, like clockwork, this time of year always seems to have investors and market participants tepid about growth prospects with their outlooks clouded by various headlines in volatile prognostications. Whether it's headlines regarding holiday sales reports, the impact of unpredictable weather on retail or fundamentals, conclusions drawn about the consumer, or changes to fiscal policy and leadership, we tend to begin each year with varied speculation and trepidation. Last year, we talked about the potential impact of higher payroll taxes, Washington dysfunctionality and gasoline prices. The year before was also gasoline prices, warm weather and the impact of cotton inflation on ready-to-wear margins. Suffice it to say, while relevant discussion points at that time, over the course of the year these issues were overcome by the consumer who once again remained resilient and continued to vote with his and her dollar in favor of retailers offering the best merchandise value and convenience. This year, mixed in with the headlines of our holiday sales, cold weather and shopper traffic or the recent macroeconomic trends being reported in Puerto Rico. Given the volume of increase from several of you on this call regarding our stake in Puerto Rico, I'd like to address the growing discussion regarding implications of the recent trends being observed and what it means for owners of high-quality retail properties. You have heard me say several times before that the great thing about our business is you don't have to guess who the winners and who the losers are in retail, due to the transparency offered by operating results. Puerto Rico is no different. Given the size and scale of our portfolio on the island, we have disproportionate access to market information and we don't have to speculate about the economic impact on the performance of our portfolio or the pulse of the local consumer. For those of you who have been on our recent property tours and have witnessed the poor traffic in sales or those of you who have accessed our website to review our presentation on Puerto Rico, you will not be surprised by the following statistics regarding the stability and performance of our portfolio: First and foremost, due to the domestic acquisitions, primarily the Blackstone transaction in 2013, Puerto Rico now accounts for 12.7% of pro rata NOI, down from 14.3% last quarter. On a blended basis, base rents per square foot are up 21% since 2010 with new lease rentals up 33% over the same period. Over the past 3 years, we re-leased 38% of the entire portfolio, while maintaining an average occupancy rate of 96.5%, and bringing several U.S.-based retailers to the island to improve the credit quality of cash flows. Occupancy is on track to grow by 50 basis points in 2014 to over 97%. In 2013 alone, NOI grew over 4% and is expected to grow by more than 5% in 2014. Also in 2013, leasing spreads were positive 34% on new deals and 10% on renewables. And this is on top of positive 15% spreads on new deals and positive 4% spreads on renewals in 2012. And perhaps, one of the most likely reported metrics yet, most telling in an area of focus for us internally as an indication of the retailer health, our accounts receivable in Puerto Rico are now at an all-time low. Over the past 2 years, the accounts receivable balance in Puerto Rico has declined by 71%. Based on the statistics I just highlighted, and similar to the commentary you've heard from other significant owners of retail, I got friends at TIMCO the macro story in Puerto Rico simply does not translate to the micro performance of our assets. Retailers are local business. Portfolio operations in Puerto Rico continue to be solid. And in several cases, outpace the fundamental result of many U.S. states with superior demographic forces. Rest assured, however, that we are watching the situation very carefully, are sensitive to government policy that may result in a negative impact and have joined forces with our friends on the island to ensure that our investment interests are protected. I'm very pleased that under the present circumstances and current narrative, we are not attempting to move capital through acquisitions, dispositions or new development. Conversely, we are operating in existing portfolio of high-quality assets that are well leased and dominate their densely populated trade areas. As a result, our portfolio in Puerto Rico is at the low-end of the risk spectrum and the high-end of the performance levels. Simply put rent, occupancy and NOI continue to rise, while our accounts receivable continue to decline. The numbers and performance are clear and Puerto Rico is a story of prosperity, not distress. Before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to briefly address the small shop leasing environment and in particular the impacts small shop leasing is having on our portfolio. Given the concentration of big boxes in our portfolio and limited amounts small shops based relative to our peer group, our leasing activity of small shop space tends to get lost in the discussion and is perhaps, underappreciated. Small shop leasing has been an area of growth in our portfolio and several operational metrics have been accretive to overall portfolio operations. We could not post the strong leasing spreads, occupancy gains and rental increases that we have reported without our small shops. Year-over-year, our small shop lease rate increased 230 basis points to 86.6%, and outperformed our overall portfolio in the fourth quarter with combined leasing spreads 180 basis points higher. Given the quality improvement of our asset base, we are confident we can increase the lease rate of this portion of our portfolio to 92%, which represents a significant organic growth, and approximately 800,000 square feet on future positive net absorption at a mark-to-market rate of approximately $25 per square foot on currently vacant space. While the credit quality of cash flow in this category pales in comparison to the junior box category, the opportunity is indisputable and certainly adds to our overall growth story and is clearly an area of focus and appreciation internally. At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thanks, Dan. The operational momentum we sought on the first 3 quarters of 2013, clearly continued into fourth quarter and we're extremely proud of our team and the results delivered in the quarter and for the full year. As a result, we surpassed our guidance and year-end lease rate goal of 95.0%, with a 95.1% leased rate up 30 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points year-over-year. We completed $2.5 million square feet of new deals and renewals in the quarter and 10.3 million square feet for the year. This was the 5th consecutive year we topped 10 million square feet in deal volume. Pro rata spreads were again strong with a positive 20.7% new deal spread, a 7.9% in renewal spread and a 10.0% combined spread for the quarter. We continue to execute on the growth levers we laid out at Investor Day and I wanted to highlight a few specific examples of our proactive approach, which continues to grow well beyond the obvious vacancy. In Jupiter, Florida, we terminated an underperforming sign mart and are backfilling the space with Marshalls HomeGoods combo store, resulting in a 185% rental comp as well as dramatic improvement in the credit quality of cash flow. Furthermore, the addition of Marshall's HomeGoods is allowing us to drive leasing and rents for the adjacent small shop space by 20% improving the NOI of this asset by 50%. As you may have seen in our recent press release, we also completed 2 new Nordstorm Rack deals in the quarter. We're capturing the Babies ""R"" Us lease in brand in Florida and a Barnes & Noble lease in Columbia, South Carolina with rental comps up 160% and 15% respectively. These deals were made possible through a combination of strategic leasing initiatives, the consolidation of small shop space, the creation of new GLA and repurposing of the former storage unit, all of which resulted in a better merchandising mix and a 20% blended NOI improvement. In regards to continuing this growth in our outlook for 2014, while a lot has been said and written about the recent holiday season, what I would like to make crystal clear is that we are not seeing changes to the long-term strategies of the successful retailers, nor any slowdown in their demand for space. Helping retailers continue to aggressively expand their footprint. Given this demand for space, I'm challenging our team to again deliver over 10 million square feet of leasing in 2014. Our pipeline of deals coming out of the fourth quarter and early indications in the first quarter of '14, give us great confidence in our revenue and occupancy guidance for the full year. We can and will capitalize on this unique environment of strong demand with virtually no new supply. We continue to view every asset and space with an eye to maximizing growth and net asset value. One great example of this is in Westlake, Ohio, where we've recently terminated an underperforming Kmart, which was paying low single digits per square foot and we'll have full control of this space at the end of May. More important than simply having control of this highly valuable underutilized space, is the fact that we're now in a position to redevelop this entire center to a higher and better use. The spreads on the 90,000 square-foot Kmart Barcelona are in the 600% plus range and we will now have the ability to redevelop the entire site and grow NOI even further. Before turning the call over to David, I want to provide an update on our redevelopment program as it is that significant internal growth driver with cash on cost yields continuing to average above 10%. Since launching the redevelopment program in 2011, we have completed 45 projects with a net investment of $240 million, at an average cash on cost yield of over 12%. Our active project list now includes 60 projects with a projected net investment of $570 million, with an average cost -- cash on cost yield continuing to be over 10%. In 2014 alone, we will spend over $150 million, and bring in at least $100 million into service at various times during the year. We remain confident this program will grow to over a $1 billion. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $104.5 million, or $0.29 per share for the fourth quarter or 7.4% increase over last year, including nonoperating items FFO for the quarter was $117.2 million, or $0.33 per share. Nonoperating items primarily consisted of the gain on change of control of interest related to the acquisition of 30 prime power centers from the joint venture with Blackstone. For the full year 2013, operating FFO was $366.7 million, or $1.11 per share, an 8% increase over 2012. 2013 was on another robust year of capital raising, as we raised over $2.8 billion of equity and debt capital. For the year, we issued $827 million of common equity at average price of $18.76 per share from the acquisitions of prime power centers and were $150 million of 6.25% preferred stock to redeem a $150 million of 7.375% existing preferred stock. And we also raised $300 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes, at a 3.375% rate in May and $300 million of 7-year senior unsecured notes at 3.5% rate in November. The average spread over U.S. treasuries on the 2 issuances was 154 basis points, which is over 80 basis points tighter than the average spread on 3 prior debt offerings in 2011 and 2012. In addition, we opportunistically accessed attractively priced long-term debt with a proactive refinancing of our credit facilities and secured term loan and advance of their maturity, decreasing the average spread by 20 basis points. As we head into 2014, we've an unencumbered asset pool that is now valued at $5.5 billion, by our bank covenants and much more by the transactional market. A significant increase from $4.3 billion at the end of 2012, and consisting of assets that are of materially higher quality than in the past. The TALF mortgage loan that encumbers 27 low loan to value asset matures in October of this year and will provide a sizable opportunity to further increase the size and quality of the unencumbered pool. Our progress was acknowledged with an upgrade by Moody's to BAA2 in the fourth quarter further solidifying DDR as an investment grade credit. Despite the negative macro headlines on Puerto Rico in recent months, financing from top life insurance companies continues to be available at attractive rates for mortgage debt on high-quality shopping centers on the island. Although our overall strategy is not to encumber many more assets, particularly those with redevelopment potential, we have recently explored the possibility of adding additional mortgage debt on one asset on the island and have received quite positive feedback from lenders that know the Commonwealth well. These lenders indicate that there is considerable interest in lending on a long-term nonrecourse basis on our typical assets in Puerto Rico at normal LTVs with an interest rate of approximately 4.5%, 10 to 20 basis points higher than available on high-quality mainland assets, which is in-line with the historic norms and which supports the fundamental strength, stability and high credit quality of our assets specifically and the attractiveness of retail and Puerto Rico in general. Turning to transactional activity. We completed $2.3 billion of acquisitions and $430 million of dispositions in 2013. We acquired 46 prime shopping centers totaling over $17 million square feet with an average size of approximately 380,000 square feet, and located primarily in the top 40 MSAs. Over 2/3 of the acquisition value is financed through new common equity or asset sales, consisting with our commitment to lowering leverage. We sold 80 nonprime assets totaling $433 million, of which our share was $296 million for the year and 20 nonprimed assets totaling $184 million, of which our share was $98 million in the fourth quarter. 27 additional nonprime assets totaling $185 million at our share currently under contract for sale, including $49 million of non-income producing assets. Regarding pricing. We continue to see a steady increase in the number of institutions such as pension funds, private REITS, and sovereign wealth funds, with a growing appetite for power centers, a trend that continues to drive cap rates down for our property type in the face of a rising interest rate environment. Despite the demand for our preferred property type, a healthy spread still exists between more power centers and similarly located grocery anchored neighborhood centers, trade in the private market, we believe this gap should narrow as the market share shifts to our top tenants. This strong pricing environment has allowed us to make considerable progress in our disposition goals only 6 weeks into the year. However, we are advancing several acquisition opportunities and continue to believe that both sides of our transactional guidance are achievable. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we currently see no major assumption changes that will leave your guidance revision from our January release. With 2014 operating FFO per share guidance range therefore remains at $1.17 to $1.21 per share, implying year-over-year growth of 7.2% at the midpoint. Finally, we declared a first quarter 2014 common stock dividend of $0.155 per share, representing a 15% increase from the prior year. Our payout ratio is approximately 50% of operating FFO, which continues to be lowest in our peer group and allows us the opportunity to fund our significant development pipeline and also the potential to raise the dividend at a growth rate in excess of operating FFO growth over the coming years. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, David. I'd like to conclude by reiterating that our story remains intact, and performance continues to accelerate. Portfolio quality is excellent. Growth is extremely visible. Macro challenges have become more micro opportunities. And 2014 guidance contemplates confident execution in the face of perceived headwinds. Moreover, this management team is committed in 2014 to remaining visible, available and transparent regarding our specific performance and the overall market conditions that we experience daily. Again, I thank you for joining on our call, and I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citigroup.
Christy McElroy: Dan, sort of a longer term kind of thing or picture question for you, you touched on this a little bit in your opening remarks and Paul you also reiterated continued strong fundamentals. But I'm wondering if you could provide some additional sort of high-level thoughts on the continued noise around the potential for future big box closure? It's consistently a pushback that we get from the investment community given the increasing competition of Amazon, from many of our your tenants and that goes beyond just typical areas of concern in consumer electronics and bookstores and office suppliers? How do you adjust that argument against the future of power center retailers and how do you -- can you provide sort of a sense for how your retailers are using the internet to compete?
David John Oakes: Sure, that's a great question and it's an interesting question, Christie, because there is chatter obviously, and we deal with the possibility of store closures on a regular basis. And the truth is we haven't seen it. You've seen the Sears announcement, you've seen the Penny announcements. For years we heard about Best Buy store closures we had won over the years. So it's -- there's a lot of noise about it but there's not a lot of evidence that it's happening in the power center community and that it's going to effect us in any meaningful way. What it does though, however, is it creates an opportunity for us that we are pursuing very, very aggressively. So for example, we are of the opinion that the office supply business in general should stink, it should shrink in square footage, and it should shrink in number of stores. But when you have a portfolio that's 95% leased overall and 97% in prime assets, and you have record demand for space, that's a great opportunity for us, and we are aggressively pursuing those retailers in an attempt to get back that space. The problem is, is that they don’t want to give back space in good assets. They want to give some back space in bad assets and fortunately we don't have a lot of bad assets left. And the good assets require a lot more work to try to get a retailer to give up that real estate. Particularly, if that happened to be a store that's making money. Retailers can't close stores that make money. It's just really is that simple. If they start liquidating profitable stores, then they're really in the real estate business, they're not really in the retail business. So we continue to battle that. Overall though, we're seeing less discussion about store closures than we have in prior years. And one other reasons is in fact, the Internet. To shop online, pickup in store concept continues to accelerate and it's been very, very successful with our tenants. We're piloting a program right now with Walmart out in Denver at one of our assets, just to see exactly how we can make it a convenient experience for the consumer. If you really believe that shop online, pickup in store, is going to be an important part of your future business plan and we happen to think that it will from most retailers, then you need to ensure that you have the right inventory levels and you need to really ensure that you have the right location that's convenient for the consumer to actually pick up the goods. Because if it's inconvenient or it's a bad experience, they're just simply not going to do it. And the worse case scenario, is for a consumer to arrive at your store and you do not have the inventory. That's the fastest way to make an enemy. So retailers understand that. So stores square footage isn't stinking. Stores aren't closing in quality assets. And with the upgrades that we've done to our portfolio and with our occupancy levels where they are, our asset quality is at the very, very high-end for the very tenants that people perceive is being somewhat at risk. So we actually become more important, not less important to those retailers. And Paul just anything you want to add to?
Paul W. Freddo: No, I just want to add that, that said, we're not sitting back waiting for any of the retailers that you might pick out, Christine, such as books or electronics or office supply or toys. We're engaged with these retailers on a regular basis. And we know that demand is great out there for us some of that good real estate and what we've like to have back in, so we are in active negotiations and discussions with these retailers. To Dan's point, not all want to close good stores, but we'll be taking initiative as we look at what we would like back to improve the merchandise mix and the cash flow of the center.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum: I appreciate the comments on Puerto Rico, because I think you're right, that's been of focus lately. Can you add some color on what you've been seeing in Brazil lately and if you can give some of the same operating stats and then talk a little bit more about your strategic thoughts in terms of Brazil's fit into the portfolio going forward?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We don't have that significant of an update on Brazil relative to what we've consistently said in the past on performance down there also have to acknowledge that they report earnings in less than 2 weeks with the report on the 26 and the call on the 27th, and so their operating stats will come out at that time, I mean, in great detail. But in general, operating fundamentals remain strong and at the stabilized malls. All of our greenfield assets have now opened. They did present more of a challenge both in terms of cost as well as in terms of time to stabilization. But I think that's very consistent with our comments over the past several quarters in terms of our long-term thought process. I think, the bar is set high for anything that complicates this company and the expectation is that it would require well above average long-term return to justify that complication. And will continue to evaluate all options and choose the course that maximizes the shareholder value for that investment.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Just thanks for the Puerto Rico comment, because that's been just huge from folks especially who cover the financials. A question David, as you guys, you talked about acquisitions. So one just, if you can remind us what's in your guidance for acquisitions and then two, how you guys think about doing acquisitions, especially if it's a larger scale thing. If you'd still would be a JV structure, sort of like what you use with Blackstone or if you guys are getting more confident in your ability to accelerate IRRs where you're fine issuing your own equity, which on our numbers is around 7, 7.1 to buy maybe mid 6s that may be on an IRR basis you can get a better return. Just wanted to understand that better, especially if there is this disconnect where you guys have a skill set and an operational understanding to act quicker than others and take advantage before the gap continues to close?
David John Oakes: Sure. Our guidance included very modest nets acquisitions for the years of about $250 million of acquisitions and $200 million of dispositions. As you can see so far, we are well on our way on the disposition pace and making good progress, although not as advanced on the acquisition pace. It is safe to assume that a large reason for that is even with the increase in interest rates we've seen, we have not seen any downtick at all in the pricing for power centers or uptick at all in the cap rate for power centers and so we've advanced the sell side a little more rapidly than the by side. We continue to look at very large number of opportunities. Some of those marketed. Most of those non-marketed. Most of those continue to be one-off assets, where we believe that we can add some specific value to a center based on our knowledge of the center, the trade area or specific tenant interest within that center. But we also have evaluated a number of portfolio deals, I don't think you will us lose any discipline regarding portfolio deals in terms of underwriting and how cautious we would be with it. And at times that does make it more challenging to underwrite a very large portfolio in a short period of time given the level of due diligence that we would absolutely expect to do. And secondly, the competition for the larger deals, as more capital comes to the space, has only been more significant and so we continue to look at everything some of which is known, some of which certainly is not known broadly, and we continue to evaluate deals and feel comfortable that we can achieve that $250 million or so of acquisitions for the year. We've guided to that level for past several years and we've massively exceeded it. But I think, we've tried to be prudent with guidance, where we're not going to force ourselves to take on a deal where we don't think either the pricing is appropriate or the risk profile is appropriate. So I think, the reasonable guidance is something that benefits us in a year when pricing has been a little higher than we expected, and so we continue to evaluate deals. I think number 1 for us is always the evaluation of the transaction. Can we make money on this shopping center or not? And number 2, then is how we would finance that? And at today's or at the recent share prices, though we have not issued equity, we have not been at all inclined to issue equity and so I think that's an important signal in terms of how we would think about funding deals going forward, and especially as we set ahead on the disposition volume that puts us in a strong position to fund any acquisitions that we're looking at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I guess pegging on Alex's question. With your focus to continue to improve DDR's portfolio quality. Is that -- does that look like it may be coming less from acquisitions and more from redevelopment?
David John Oakes: I think redevelopment obviously is a great opportunity and it is really the best use of our capital. So we'll continue the redevelopment would be a big part of how we intend to improve the quality of our existing portfolio. A lot of that redevelopment though, keep in mind Craig is really at our very best assets as well. So the improvement in the quality, it's hard to go from an A to an A in some cases. But the improvement really becomes merchandise mix and offering to the consumer. As far as acquisitions are concerned, we still live in an extraordinarily fragmented universe. The owners of quality power centers across the U.S. is as fragmented as it's ever been and we still do view that as an opportunity to improve the portfolio. So it'll be a combination of both. I think the fragmentation and in some cases the mispricing gives us the opportunity on the acquisition side. And the real gap between the supply and demand dynamics that currently exist on the landlord, tenant relationship side gives us extraordinary redevelopment opportunities. So I think you'll see a healthy dose of both.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan with MLV.
Paul Morgan: It just encouraging to hear the target for the small shop occupancy. I know -- I don't think you were tracking it that closely in terms of the breakout prior to the recession. So I'm just kind a get sense of how do you get to the 92% number? Is that just kind of based on kind where your top centers and getting others up there and then also where you seeing the strength coming from? Is it larger franchises or segments within the space, like restaurants or healthcare or anything like that? Is there any color you can provide just to how can get from where you are now to 92%?
David John Oakes: It's great question Paul. I don’t know if you remember last quarter an investor were probably talking about 90%. The fact is that we've improved the quality of the portfolio and we're more of a power center across the board versus the gross community center. There's a higher quality of small shop space within those assets. Higher-quality anchors higher quality small shop space, a lower percentage of shop space within those assets. We took a hard look over the last couple of months and quite frankly, we were aiming to low. Historically this group is less than 5000 square feet hit about an 89%, maybe 90%. We are quite confident as we look at it now, we look at the improvement and the quality of the portfolio, that 92% is very achievable. And as I said on other goals we've internally set before, I'm not sure we stop there. It's just something that's reaching beyond where we've been in the past and it is all about quality. In terms of who we're leasing to it is all the categories you mentioned, the traditional food, some of the newer nontraditional chipotle, Panera the cell phone users, the service-oriented shops, franchises in general. We are seeing improved health on the part of mom and pops, but they really not going to be the story in our portfolio that power center format going forward. But again better quality of small shop space and quite frankly we were aiming too low and we're confident we can hit that over the next several years.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: We do struggle, Paul, a little bit you mentioned, healthcare for example and I know there has been quite a bit of conversation about that. We do have internal discussions on a regular basis as whether we should lease space to non-retail users. And one of the problems with doing that of course is it's typically not an acceptable cotenant to retail users. So it fills space and it pays rent from a merchandise mix standpoint if you have a high-quality center. Can be very careful, where you go in the service industry because the perception of your asset can change depending on who you lease to. So we probably are doing less healthcare, less non-retail if you will, uses in our small shop leasing and I think that will continue out of availability of interest quite frankly. We have enough small shop interest in the typical retail uses that we don't have to go, sort of off the reservation and lease to folks that aren't really compatible with our anchors or the other small shops in the shopping center.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong: You've been sitting on some ground up development projects for a while, about $215 million on hold. Can you talk a little bit about where you see the activity going in 2014, and maybe the composition of projects there that you'd like to sell versus continue to build?
David John Oakes: Yes, Jonathan. We've made some great progress obviously over the last couple of years, whether it's been pad sales, anchor sales, non-retail users. We brought C block, which you see in the of great development, ground-up development project, which will open late second quarter of this year. That plan we held for number of years. As the market, the economy, the demand got better, we now have the center with Walmart, Dick's, Michaels, Ulta, PetSmart, name your best in class retailers. It's a great story. Mary in Kansas recently showed up and our projects under development was also land held for a number of years. Sold the big piece to Ikea and developing around that, again a great story. We've got a couple of more, which are not fully active at this point. But again, as demand increases and the market improves, we see more and more of our Atlanta has been in that held category if becoming ground-up development. We've got one in Connecticut, one in Florida that we're very focused on, and moving towards either at late '14 or '15 start for those projects. That's all great news. Couldn't have told you the same story 4 years ago. But again that's a function of the demand that's out there and the improving market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Again, just want to go back to your opening comments, just about the sort of the headlines and some of the noise that we hear every year at the start of the year. Just curious, I mean the headlines have been fairly negative on the retail sector. I'm just wondering what your major takeaways were from holiday 2013?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well my major takeaways really were that, while it was just a fair season overall for retail, I would much rather be a retailer today then a vendor. The amount of pressure that retailers are putting on the vendors because it's interesting, while sales sometimes aren't great, and even reported margins aren't always terrific, balance sheets are pretty darn good. And one of the reasons why that is, is because vendors are supporting these retailers in the variety of different ways and supporting the sales and supporting the markdowns. So my general feeling was that, I'm not concerned from the retail perspective because there's always support coming from the vendor community. But I think it's going to be an extraordinarily difficult year on the vendor community and I think the pressure that they were under this holiday season was somewhat unprecedented, particularly because we had a shorter selling season, therefore markdowns came earlier and markdowns support had to come earlier. So it's interesting to watch it. I think one of the things that's really happened is that the holiday shopping season has changed dramatically over the years. We used to sit around and really feel that on December 26, if the numbers weren't great, we think Thanksgiving and Christmas, we're going to lose retailers. Things were going to happen. But if you really look at how retailers are adjusting to the holiday season, it's not nearly as significant from a life-and-death perspective as it used to be. Tenants can take a top holiday season, they're not in a position where they're going to disappear overnight the way they were 5 years ago or even 10 or 15 years ago quite frankly. Most tenants have not only do they have reserves, but they have inventory controls in place today that far exceed the risk that you have by having a weaker holiday season. So I'm -- I was somewhat disappointed that some of our retailers didn't go for the holiday season, the way I would have liked. If you walk into the stores, for example, right after Black Friday, inventory levels were relatively low, and often on very unexciting. And when inventory levels were low and the store is not very exciting, it's not going to translate into good sales. However, that was done intentionally for a variety of different reasons and I think balance sheets will prove that retailers manage the holiday season pretty well. So I think it was a decent season for retailers. I don't think it was great. I think it will be less than decent for the vendor community.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with ISI Group.
Steve Sakwa: Dan, I know you talk a lot about sort of capital deployment and development and redevelopment, I guess in particular a kind of highest and best use of capital. I guess given the demand for your product type and the disconnect that you believe exist between the public and private market. Does the share buybacks ever make sense? I know you issued equity in the 18s, but the stock is below 16 today. Does that sort of enter your thought process, or is kind of the selling and buying of stock just create too much friction and you just sort of have to kind of grin and bear it at this point and wait for the market to turn?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, it's certainly something that we discussed it's not something that we're enthusiastic about or that we're exited about doing. In my view you have to trade at an extraordinarily significant discount to NAV and have really no other options for your capital in order to do that. I think that right now we are in sort of an interesting cycle, where headlines are grabbing people's attention and operating fundamentals are being relatively ignored to a large extent, and that won't last forever. And I don't think it's really in our best interest at this point in time to put a share buyback at the high-end of our priority list, particularly given some of the other opportunities that we have.
Operator: Your next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: A quick question about your -- you guys used to talk a lot about splitting up Big Boxes and creating 2 junior boxes. So I have a couple of questions regarding that. Now first, does that show up in your lease spreads or is that categorized as noncomp so there is no true lease spread? And second part of that, how much of you done in terms of square footage in 2013 and how much is there more to do in 2014 and what would the impact look like to your top line?
Paul W. Freddo: On the first question, we do not include the split of a Box, any reconfiguration will not make it into spreads and to be honest with you in what would happen is they would be so overstated, typically if you had a box that was leased at $12 a foot and you split it you're going to be in the $16 to $18 range easily. So we're not including that which again lends to the conservative nature of our reporting on spreads. Over the last 2 years, we've done over 18 of these downsizings which were for about 650,000 square feet. There's no specific number out there in terms of what we have left to do. We're going to do what's right for the asset in terms what's the merchandise mix. I mean, Ulta, is clearly a player that comes to mind when you talk about downsizings or splits and they are still very aggressively looking for a 100-plus a year new locations. So there's no given number that we expect we can do at the amount of square feet or X location. It's really just what's best for the mix, what the demand is for the space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd M. Thomas: Dan, in your opening remarks, you said that momentum has accelerated, and I understand it is still upside in terms of small shop leasing and occupancy and that rents are trending higher. But, there's arguably less occupancy outside today and David mentioned the cap rates are unchanged or even lower despite higher rates and making it more difficult to buy properties. So I was just wondering when you say that momentum has accelerated, what part of the businesses is gaining momentum, specifically in this DDR sort of augmented strategy at all to take advantage of this acceleration at all?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes, I mean the momentum is accelerated basically and everything that has to do with the tenant because the demand has continued to increase. As Paul said, there's been no pullback at all from any of our tenants in any significant way and demand is still there and we do augment our business model because we're being much more aggressive on redevelopment. We'll be much more aggressive on potential tenant buyouts, lease terminations if we can, trying to get back space because we know that won't last forever. And we think that this is a very interesting time. I can't remember a time in recent memory for sure where we had tenant demand as high as it is and landlord leverage is high as it is. Well, that's not going to last forever. And while we're still in this particular cycle, I think we do have to take advantage of it. So capital markets aside from then and I think you've seen we get with there a lot of momentum in the capital market side, we've been very transactional in that area. Anything related to the tenants in our particular product type right now is hot. And we need to take advantage of that as best we can. It also includes on the acquisition side, because some assets that we look at because of the fragmented nature of our sector are undermanaged. They're either undermanaged because those landlords didn't have the leverage or they may not have the capital. So there's value-add opportunities or core plus opportunities that if we put assets into our platform given the tenant demand, we can really accelerated our returns on that particular asset regardless of our going in cap rate. Those are the assets we're looking for. So, yes, I mean, we are augmenting our strategy by being much more aggressive in the markets in areas where we can leverage our operating platform and maximize value as quickly as possible.
Operator: Your next question is from Jason White with Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: I was just wondering, is there any evidence that those tenants have been desiring to shrink their sales force foot print, have plans to utilize that excess GLA as distribution space to support their online sales formats in the long-term?
David John Oakes: Jason, at this point it's more of a discussion. I don't have any real evidence, but it's clearly something we kick around with the guys like the Best Buys, but where is going to be the space need going forward. Right now, they have not shrunk their sales floor but it's something they're thinking about.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: And it's something that they should do at some point in time is that what the market calls for. Because you will need like I mentioned earlier, you will need to be in stock if shop online, pick up in store is important. And now they have to be stock which you have to be convenient to get to and experience when the consumer gets there has to pleasant. You can't have shop online pickup and store and have your consumer going to the loading dock next to the dumpster to pick up the merchandise, that's not a pleasant experience. So retailers are all looking at that now and I think that is one of the reasons why we haven't seen a decline in square footage from the people that often are being publicized as desiring that because they need to know -- they need to have the square footage to support the inventory necessary to satisfy the consumer who shops online to pick up in store. So I think as that evolves, the actual square footage requirements will also evolve but it's not going to be necessarily distribution facility as much as it's going to be inventory areas that not only support the online sales to pickup, to shipping, as well and also support the actual store, and the walk-in consumer also.
Operator: Next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.
Michael W. Mueller: These volumes talk a little bit about where shops and box rents are compared to the pre downturn and then just what would be the implications for on what most start to see national development pickup?
David John Oakes: We're right about where we were prerecession, Michael. Not all categories, not all locations. But we're very happy and I think you see that reflected in the spread quarter after quarter. We're buffing those mid-teens to 20% this quarter. We're seeing rents that are right there. You got to keep in mind prerecession, different rents for ground-up development versus second-generation space. We've been dealing mostly with the second-generation space in the last 5 years. But to get those rents back to where they were previous session is a big deal and we're there. And I don't think it's slowing down, to be honest with you. The demand we've been talking about on the entire call is terrific and if you just look at the best-in-class guys who are looking to grow aggressively. Their numbers aren't slowing down. In terms of what that means for ground-up development, ground-up development that makes sense will get done. We haven't really been waiting just for rents to be at a certain level. I mean its got to be demand, the site has got to be right, everything has to be right. And if that means it's the best way to monetize some of the land we've had on the books that's what we're going to do. It really hasn't been lets wait for that magic day when rents are the same as they were prerecession.
Operator: Next question is from James Sullivan with Cowen Group.
James W. Sullivan: Back on the Analyst Day, Paul, you talked a good deal about the mark-to-market opportunity as option terms and some of the anchor leases burnoff. I'm curious, how those negotiations are going, as a general point? And also to what extent, if any, anchor lease terms on new or renewal leases are becoming more favorable generally to DDR? And what I'm thinking of particularly there is whether or not you're getting more or better bumps in base rents in new leases, whether you're giving fewer or shorter options that kind of thing?
Paul W. Freddo: The mark-to-market opportunity is there Jim, and that's what really driving the numbers. The 2 examples I gave with Rack, in Columbia, South Carolina was the deal where we did not renew a naked Barnes & Noble lease with the Babies ""R"" Us brand in Florida was one that we terminated the lease, I mean the growth leverage exactly as we laid out at Investor Day. That continues to be our focus. Dan and I were both talking earlier about some of the other headline retailers again, whether its office, toys, electronics, books. That is the big focus of our entire team to make sure we're figuring out a way to get that space back. Whether it's natural exploration or negotiation and market-to-market, because that's what's going to drive the spreads and the growth in these assets going forward. I think one of the things that's interesting to look at is the leased rate, one of the other callers asked about, you're at 95-plus percent leased, just to look at the buying of deals that we're still doing, given that lease rate which is now 600 basis points higher than our low back in 2009. And at the function of what we're doing to recycle the space to higher and better uses, higher rents, better mixes, et cetera. In terms of the lease terms, I would tell you that even some of the noneconomic are improving -- some of the noneconomic terms whether it's co-tenancy, we can negotiate harder as space is in demand, people are competing for space. I mean that's an obvious. Its a little bit of leasing one-on-one. When you have demand for space and people competing for that space, you drive the harder bargain. Starts with the rents, but certainly plays out into the options, the bumps and the noneconomic issues within the lease.
Operator: Your next question is from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies.
Tayo Okusanya: My question has to do with disposition. Just given that top grades remains a type and your target of generating most of the your NOI from your prime assets, just curious, how much more by way of disposition do you see happening in the portfolio to kind of hit those targets, and what that means for potentially doing more dispositions in 2014 unless it's what's in the guidance?
David John Oakes: I think we've obviously been very active on the disposition front, than by far the largest seller of assets particularly non-prime assets. But over the past 5, 6 years, continued to be ahead of the class, you've seen us based on a strong pricing environment accelerate the timing and pace of dispositions. This year with the considerable amount, that we are under contract dominance, so I think you can assume that guidance for the $200 million or so dispositions is very achievable and hopefully something we can exceed. We don't look at that side on it's own. We also are obviously spending considerable amounts of time looking for the reinvestment opportunity in the high-quality prime assets. But given where the market is today, we've certainly seen more progress at the very early stage of the year on the disposition side given where pricing is and we would expect to continue to make progress from the 91.5% or so prime portfolio that exist today up to the 95% target that we established in the 5-year plan. The guidance of past few years has been that $200 million or so year of dispositions. We've exceeded that for past few years, and I think to the extent we continue to see a strong environment. This year we would be happy to accelerate that process. Some of it is always going to be subject to debt that's on assets or specific tenant related items. But we are extremely focused on continuing to dispose of those non-prime assets. There's less of them remaining . There's less inventory. There is a less of the true dregs left that represented the hardest and yet smallest dollar amount of sales. But it continues to be a major focus for our transactions team.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'neil.
Alexander David Goldfarb: Dan, just want to the circle back with the increased attention the B malls are getting. Obviously the Simon and Spinco and then you've got the Starwood platform out there. Do you think that as these companies consolidate the B malls, they're going to increasingly look to big box tenants more than just anchors and try and do another round of de-malling if you will, like we saw last decade or you think the de-malling thing didn't work, so at the end all we're going to see is just big box as anchors but that's probably about it as these guys acquire more B malls?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: That's a great question, Alex. De-malling doesn't work for a B mall, it works for like an F mall. And the reason being is that you have B malls still have tenants that have contractual rights that you need consent from in order to de-mall. It's very, very expensive. It's very time-consuming. And the returns are very, very low. So it didn't really work well with malls. A mall really has to be dead in order to de-malled effectively and in order to make money. So I don't think you'll see it much in the B mall business. And we have not seen that much in the B mall business, if you look at the de-malling that have been done historically including some of the ones that we did, there were like no tenants, or 3 or 4 tenants that you can afford to buy out. But there wasn't a situation where you're 70% leased or 75% leased or even 80% leased, it makes it extraordinarily difficult to get the consent to do what you want to do on a de-malling basis. I think the B mall operators will continue to look at power center tenants and others as they look to fill space. Because obviously, keeping that space filled and keeping it filled at the right price and keeping the shopping center attractive because consumer has been a challenge. And there are some folks out there, that are doing great job of it and there are some folks that are just getting started. But I will say that the opportunity does exist today to deals with some of our tenants, because again there is really very little new supply. Demand is still very high, and if tenants have to make a decision between whether going to a power center or a B mall, our tenants will always pick a power center because that's where they prototype and that's what their economic basis is for their operation. However, if there is no power center available, and they have to make the decision between whether skipping a market or going to a B mall, they will be wise to go to a B mall and those opportunities certainly exist and we're seeing some of that. And we think that's very healthy for the retail environment.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, all, again for joining us. We are very excited about 2013 and we're even more excited about 2014. And look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes your presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."
24,SITC,1,2014,2014-05-07 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 2014 DDR Corp. Earnings First Quarter Conference Call. My name is Crystal, and I will be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Meghan Finneran, Financial Analyst. Please, proceed.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as amended. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO and Operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplements are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone a chance to participate. [Operator Instructions] At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As illustrated by our first quarter operating metrics, our portfolio continues to perform at an extremely high level in historically strong and soft quarters. With over 3 million square feet of leasing in the first quarter and the sale of our Brazil interest, I thought it would be appropriate to take a step back and reflect on the portfolio transformation that permits us to post operating numbers that continue to exceed even our own lofty expectations. I'd like to start by reflecting on the strategic and operational significance of the closing of the Brazil transaction. Several years ago, when we laid out a plan to simplify this company, reduce risk and eliminate the complexity that resulted from legacy transactions, the risk in the plan was market receptivity that would enable successful execution for the benefit of all our shareholders. As we sit here today, we are pleased to say that our exit from Brazil exceeded our expectations, and the execution of the transaction represents a significant milestone for this company as we move beyond the investments that complicated our story and distracted investors' attention from our core business. At the end of the day, while Brazil only accounted for 4% of our NOI, it represented about 75% of investor and analyst questions. While the strategic benefits of selling our stake in Brazil were obvious, it is important to note that we continue to execute with a long-term focus on NAV, not short-term FFO, which will position this company for attractive long-term risk-adjusted growth. Given the significance of our exit from Brazil, it's a good time to pause and reflect on what we have accomplished, what we now own and how we are continuing to upgrade the quality of this portfolio. Today, DDR is a pure play, power center-focused company with a dramatically reduced risk profile, simplified story and significantly enhanced portfolio. Following the sale of Brazil, we have eliminated 11 joint ventures in the past 3.5 years and we continue to reduce our JV platform, particularly ventures that no longer align with our core business. Since 2010, our capital recycling program has resulted in selling nearly 300 assets, representing $2.7 billion, and we have purchased more than 75 prime power centers representing $2.9 billion in major markets. This portfolio transformation has enabled us to lease 48 million square feet since 2010, and achieve same-store NOI growth in excess of 3% for the past 8 quarters. Additionally, the average size of our assets has increased 27% and base rent per square foot has increased nearly 10%, reflecting the market dominance and tenant demand for our power center product even in difficult -- even in a difficult environment. We have reduced the number of markets in which we own and operate shopping centers from 170 in 2010 to just 105 today, and increased our exposure of annual base rent derived from the top 50 MSAs from 57% in 2010 to 72% today. Our active portfolio management platform has significantly increased our exposure to key tenants including Whole Foods, Nordstrom Rack, Five Below, Ulta, the Ascena Retail Group of brands, Panera and LA Fitness, all of whom are now in our 50 tenant roster ranked by annual base rent. Moreover, Sears, Kmart, Staples, Rite Aid and Tops Supermarket are no longer in our top 25 tenant roster. Looking forward, our portfolio transformation will continue and we expect operating results to follow suit. With regard to the transactions environment, cap rates from our -- for our product continue to compress, and we see an incredible opportunity to increase non-prime and prime-minus assets as there's significant demand and a dearth of comparable products on the market. Our increased disposition guidance is resulting in unprecedented liquidity for this company, and we are actively sourcing off-market acquisition opportunities to reinvest capital at attractive returns in core markets, which will further accelerate our portfolio transformation process. Specifically, we are excited about the previously announced acquisition opportunities described in our quarterly transactions press release, which are located in major metros including Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver and Northern California, all of which we expect to close later this year. Before turning the call over to Paul, I'd like to take a moment to address the common theme of first quarter earnings for our retailers and retail REITs so far, which is the weather. There has been much chatter about the impact weather has had on first quarter operating results for both retailers and landlords. While we can all agree that the winter was harsh and retail sales were legitimately impacted in a negative manner, the overall effect across our portfolio was immaterial due to prenegotiated and capped contracts with vendors, the realistic internal budgeting process and proactive collection efforts. With regard to the few recently announced store closings from retailers, please keep in mind that retailers like to use weather as an excuse for poor performance. But the reality is that these store closures are long overdue and make the overall retail landscape much healthier. Not surprisingly, the retailers that are closing stores are those that have experienced a rapid erosion in market share and suffered from directionless merchandising strategies. The timing for store closure could not be better as the list of retailers looking to expand remains robust. Importantly, as Paul will discuss in more detail, we have not seen any pullback in store opening plans from the retailers we have done the most business with over the past 5 years, and we expect the recently announced store closings to be a net positive for our portfolio, as we re-lease space at positive spreads and improve the overall merchandise mix of our assets. At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul W. Freddo: Thank you, Dan. Before briefly covering a few highlights of our first quarter performance, I would like to point out that all leasing metrics as recorded in our supplement, including historical metrics, now exclude Brazil and reflect the domestic and Puerto Rico portfolio exclusively. In the first quarter, we executed 378 new deals and renewals for 3.1 million square feet, our strongest volume in 19 quarters and the second highest quarterly volume in our company's history. This is without the benefit of the deal flow from the Brazilian portfolio and is a strong indication of the significant retailer demand that we continue to see for prime power center space in our domestic portfolio, even in a quarter that has produced historically tepid numbers. Not only did we deliver extraordinary results from a volume perspective, we continued to drive rents with a new deal spread of 20% and a 9% blended spread for the quarter. Our leased rate increased 10 basis points to 95.1%, which compares favorably to the historic average decline of 20 basis points in the first quarter. We remain confident we will deliver a leased rate increase of at least 75 basis points this year, consistent with our guidance. With the lease rate now in excess of 95% and a boxed leased rate of nearly 98%, the question I am most frequently asked is, ""How would you continue to deliver strong leasing volume and organic growth?"" Back in October, at our Investor Day, we presented several initiatives and organic growth leverage we are pursuing, including naked leases, small-shop consolidations, anchor downsizing, proactive lease terminations and redevelopments. Today, I would like to focus on proactive lease terminations and provide an example of how we are generating incremental organic growth in an environment of continued strong tenant demand and new-supply generation below historic levels. We have been actively negotiating recaptured deals with a number of retailers looking to right-size their real estate footprint in the books, toys, office and traditional department store categories. I'm excited to report that we have recently finalized or are in the process of finalizing 20 deals representing 465,000 square feet of prime box space located in power centers across the country. Importantly, many of these recaptures are structured as ongoing landlord recapture rights and not with fixed termination dates, providing maximum flexibility in terms of timing and the ability to finalize replacement deals with minimal downtime. The below-market rents for these 20 locations represent an estimated mark-to-market opportunity of over 40%, significantly improving the growth profile of these prime assets which are currently 98% leased. Our net investment in these locations including acquisition and projected re-tenanting costs will be approximately $33 million, with an estimated un-levered cash on cost yields from the low double-digits to the mid-teens. In addition to the obvious upside in rental income, same-store NOI growth, asset value enhancement and improved credit quality of cash flow, these recaptures can also lead to further redevelopment opportunities and merchandising enhancements. We will recapture 7 of these initial locations in 2014 and expect that by spring of 2015, we will have exercised our right to recapture all locations, provided the tremendous demand from the retail community. Tenants such as Nordstrom Rack, Sprouts Farmers Market, Ulta, Whole Foods, Five Below, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Trader Joe's, White House Black Market, Gap Factory, Shoe Carnival, PetSmart and Carter's are just a few of the names with whom we're finalizing deals to backfill these locations. While we are excited about this first wave of opportunities, we view this as a multiyear plan. Our target list continues to grow as we remain proactive with our retailers in identifying mutually beneficial opportunities to recapture space in advance of natural lease expirations while simultaneously capitalizing on the demand we are experiencing for high-quality box locations within our portfolio. I look forward to updating you on our progress with this initiative. Finally, as you know, recon is just over a week away. We have a strong slate of meetings, and we'll continue to focus on this and our other growth initiatives. I want to remind everyone that we will be located at the Bellagio in the Da Vinci ballroom this year and not at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We have great space and look forward to seeing you there. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David John Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $100.7 million, or $0.28 per share for the first quarter. Including nonoperating items, FFO for the quarter was $85.8 million, or $0.24 per share. Nonoperating items primarily consisted of impairment of a joint venture investment and a charge-related determination of a Kmart lease that is expensed under GAAP. We have made a number of announcements since the start of 2014 and I would like -- that I would like to touch on in further detail. First, we announced the closing of the sale of our investment in Brazil on April 28. As Dan mentioned, the transaction represents a significant step in DDR's simplification process, and does so in an IRR to DDR of more than 10% over the life of the investment. More importantly, the sale of our investment in Brazil is indicative of our continued desire to decrease the risk profile of this company over the course of an economic cycle. By exiting Brazil, we reinforced our commitment to lowering sovereign, currency, partner and development risk in a transaction with little friction and with strategic merit for all parties. The $344 million of proceeds to DDR present an opportunity for us to reinvest the cash accretively in the recently announced redemption of the remaining $55 million of our 7 3/8% Class H preferred shares, as well as in our focused property-type prime domestic power centers. While the dilution associated with holding that cash for a period of time is noticeable in 2014 results, we will not sacrifice our investment criteria to reinvest the proceeds in suboptimal assets or at mediocre returns. Capital allocation remains a top priority for this company, and NAV growth over the long term coupled with shareholder return remain more important than simple FFO growth. To that end, we encourage the investment community to look into our recently filed proxy statement to understand management's compensation metrics, and how our compensation is more closely aligned with the investment community in the long-term growth than the vast majority of our peers. Second, we also announced an increase in our domestic disposition guidance from $200 million to $400 million. The increase was the direct result of the strong disposition environment for B-quality shopping centers that no longer fit our investment criteria. As we have mentioned previously, we have implemented a dedicated portfolio management team committed to underwriting each asset and ranking them based on CapEx-adjusted NOI growth, NSA, sales, credit, market dominance and merchandising mix. This process has brought to light a number of low-prime shopping centers that we decided to market and have received very positive pricing fee backups. As of the end of the first quarter, we sold 14 non-prime assets for gross proceeds of $198 million and have an additional $133 million of non-prime and non-income producing assets under contract for sale. Of the operating assets sold or under contract, the large majority of small-format neighborhood centers are single-tenant assets under a 135,000 square feet, further reinforcing our investment thesis to own large format prime power centers in top MSAs. The low-quality assets under contract or LOI are currently projected to sell an average cap rate in the low 7% range, indicative of the strength of the disposition market and our desire to take advantage of it. The sale of our investment in Brazil and the increased disposition activity was a direct reasons for our increased Operating FFO guidance range of $1.14 to $1.18 per share. The current range outlines a midpoint growth rate of 5% per share, above the sector average and consistent with our total shareholder return goal of 8% to 10% annually. With that said, the previously announced reduction in current-year FFO guidance is not something we take lightly, but one that we felt was prudent given the transactional environment and opportunity to further streamline our portfolio and position ourselves for long-term growth and lower risk. In addition, we view any dilution as short-term reinvestment dilution, as we believe our ability to reallocate this cash in a high-quality asset means we can redeploy this capital and recreate this NOI in the near-term versus the long-term dilution experienced during the peak of our repositioning out of much more challenged assets several years ago. I would also like to address our previously disclosed desire to take advantage of the secured debt market in Puerto Rico in order to highlight the lack of effects that macroeconomic headlines have had on property-level fundamentals and valuations. We continue to advance the non-recourse financing of our quality shopping center on the island from a top life insurance company and a normal loan to value with an interest rate just 10 to 20 basis points outside of high-quality major market mainland assets, and in-line with historic norms. We expect to close on this financing during the second quarter. Finally, I would like to draw your attention to our recently revised supplemental package. During the course of each year, we have been getting investor feedback, and typically employ major disclosure changes in the first quarter. The new supplemental package is streamlined, but includes none of the previous disclosure, and in fact adds new information. We now include additional disclosure on same-store NOI including a detailed same-store income statement and same-store leased rate. As we've stated before, we feel that our calculation is sector-leading in terms of legitimacy, as it excludes redevelopments, bad debt expenses, lease termination fees and non-cash items, all of which add artificial volatility to quarterly results. I would also like to point out that our operating metrics in Section 4 of the supplemental including same-store NOI leased rate rent per square foot leasing spreads all exclude the ownership of Brazil in the first quarter of 2014, despite the company's economic ownership during the quarter, for purposes of better comparability going forward. We continue to strive for sector-leading disclosure and look forward to your feedback on the current package. At this point, I'll stop and turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Thanks, David. In conclusion, we remain very optimistic about the continued transformation of our portfolio and our ability to now focus exclusively on our core business in core markets. As David mentioned, we are in an unprecedented position of liquidity, and we will remain disciplined, patient and creative in allocating capital with a focus on delivering long-term NAV growth and total shareholder return. While there is much volatility in our sector due to new emerging companies, management turnover and secession planning concerns, we are not distracted by this noise, but rather, we like our position of stability and consistent performance, and we are encouraged by the prospects for continued portfolio quality enhancement, capital recycling, and organic growth. Again, thank you for joining our call this morning. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America.
Craig R. Schmidt: I was wondering what you thought the total number of power centers in the nation was and your market share of that, and if you're seeing a competition increase for the acquisition of these power centers like we're seeing in the other portion of this category?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Well, I'll tell you, that's a great question, Craig, and it's hard to put your arms around it. I know that -- and I know this is not a great answer, but there's a lot of power centers and we own a small percentage of them. So it's a relatively fragmented market. Unlike the mall business, which is highly consolidated, the power center business is not. While we are clearly a consolidator and we're very focused and we've differentiated ourselves as a result, the opportunities in the market continue to be pretty significant. I'll give you an example. In the first quarter alone, we saw 33 deals that we looked at across 19 states that we underwrote. And the assets were worth about $1.6 billion. And again, this is just power centers that fit a very small criteria that we've employed. The total square footage of those deals is 9.1 million square feet, and the average deal size was about 300,000 square feet. So there's a lot of things that we're looking at on a regular basis. There's no shortage of product out there for us. We are seeing some more competition than we've seen in the past, particularly from some of the direct invest and sovereign wealth, et cetera, entities. But we're not seeing as much competition from people who look at the assets on a core-plus basis and truly understand the value of leveraging an operating platform to enhance value of an asset that may even be 95%, 96%, 97% leased. But when we put those assets into our platform and employ some of the things that Paul talked about and our tenant relations, we're able to take a core asset to one person and make it a core-plus for us, and we think that will sustain a lot of growth. So we have a view of power centers in respective markets but our -- the total number is so large and our ownership percentage is so small that it rarely comes into our thinking and we feel the runway is very long.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Christy McElroy from Citi.
Christy McElroy: David, just regarding the TALF mortgage loan that comes due in October, can you remind me what's the timing for when you can pay that down? What are your plans for funding the paydown? And what are your plans for those assets once unencumbered? Are there any disposition opportunities in there?
David John Oakes: Yes. The TALF facility has a maturity date in early October and a 90-day prepayment window before that. Based on our budgeting, at the beginning of the year the expectation was to refinance that loan primarily or exclusively with unsecured debt. At this point, with the considerable amount of liquidity that we have available, the considerable amount of cash that we're sitting on today, our expectation would be simply to repay that facility with cash on hand. And so I think the goal, overall, and clearly, the balance sheet strategy had been to increase the size and even the quality of the unencumbered pool, and this should be a situation where we can increase that size and quality quite significantly without even adding any additional unsecured debt based on where we stand today with the disposition proceeds from U.S. assets as well as from the Brazilian sale. So I think we're very well positioned to deal with the only real maturity that we have this year and significantly enhance our credit metrics by unencumbering those assets.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Todd Thomas from KeyBanc.
Grant Keeney: This is Grant Keeney on for Todd. I noticed in the lease expiration schedule that -- noticed the portfolio has been pruned over the last several quarters, the average for rent per square foot in the inline basis tick down a bit, especially in leases expiring next couple of years. So it appears that those -- and given greater mark-to-market opportunity, Paul, you touched on some retaining opportunities in your opening remarks, but can you update us on how much below market small-shop rents are in the overall portfolio and what that opportunity looks like today?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes. First thing you need to be aware of is those numbers that have come down with Brazil out of the mix and out of the metrics. So Brazil, with a significant amount of small-shop space, particularly at higher rents than our portfolio average, reduced the average rent per square foot to what you're seeing in the supplement. Yet we think there's great upside in both the box space and the small-shop space. No specific percentage, but we're seeing great increases, whether it's a new deal that we saw the 20% spread on a pro rata basis or the renewals in the high single digits. Our goal, as I've stated on a few of these calls, is to get that renewal spread somewhere right around 10% or even north if we can. That's going to come with extensions -- negotiated extensions that are not exercises of options. About half of the renewable portfolio has options. So we've been limited by that percentage. But I would say, we're continuing to see something in the high-teens on the new and in the high singles or low doubles on the renewal spreads.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Dan, going back to your opening remarks about some proactive lease terminations that you guys are pursuing and the 40% upside that you've kind of already identified in 20 deals, does that -- how much of that -- what percent of that basket includes Sears, Office Depot type of leases versus other type of retailers? And do you -- I guess, that's the first question.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. That's -- they're exclusively tenants that you would expect us to be doing these transactions with. They're not the market share winners. The reason why, Ki Bin, we can't name specific names or locations is because we have to be sensitive to the employees of those locations where the stores might be closing that haven't yet been notified by their employer that, that store might close. So we're sensitive to that. But as Paul mentioned, you can assume that it will be in the struggling sectors from a merchandising perspective across the board including books, toys and office. And in fact, that list, we expect to continue to increase over time. It doesn't make any sense, quite frankly, to terminate a tenant that's performing at or above the sales-per-square-foot level in your center that's adding a merchandising mix to your center that makes you unique or that is being appreciated by the consumer. But it makes perfect sense to try to remove the underperformers and folks where you're not quite sure where their merchandising strategy is going. But you're going to have to deal with that problem down the road anyway in all likelihood. So we might as well be proactive about it, which is what we're trying to do. And in this market where there's no new supply at all and the demand is incredibly high, we think this is a unique period to effectuate these transactions. And we hate to be on the other side and think that we missed this opportunity. So that's why we're doing what we're doing. But it is exactly, as you said, with more of the struggling tenants that are pretty well known to all in this call.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan from MLV.
Paul Morgan: Just on the leased rate breakdown, on -- the under-5,000-square-feet got -- fell a bit sequentially. Maybe if you could provide a little bit of color there, whether that might have been affected by taking Brazil out? And then as you look from where you want to get toward the end of the year, what are we going to see the drivers within the size buckets? Is it going to be the smaller shops is it going to be the bigger stores, a little bit of color maybe?
David John Oakes: You got it, Paul. Yes, you hit it on the head. I mean, the primary impact quarter-over-quarter was the elimination of the Brazil rate, which was, I think it was 96%, Paul. So obviously, that had our average of the under-5,000-square-foot space a little higher. If you look at, apples-to-apples, just the domestic and Puerto Rico, we were basically flat quarter-over-quarter and up about 140 basis points year-over-year. So still a very positive trend. And again, that all comes with the continued improvement of the portfolio, whether it's sales and acquisitions, more power center, less community center. We haven't changed our opinion that we can drive that less-than-5,000-square-foot category to 92%, which would be a historical high by a couple of hundred basis points. Consolidations kick into that, and as I mentioned, asset sales. But clearly we're seeing great demand from the fast foods, the McDonalds, the Chick-fil-A, the Five Guys, Chipotle, Panera, some of the smaller non-food users, Crazy 8, Claire's, Justice, Sally Beauty, Massage Envy there's a long list. So it's driven more by the nationals, regionals and franchisees, and not so much by the mom-and-pops, even though we've seen a little more stability in that mom-and-pop category.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Schaffer from Sandler O'Neill.
Andrew Schaffer: Regards to your acquisition pipeline, are you currently evaluating a JV as far as sheer size of potential acquisitions?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: Yes. We constantly look at our JV pipeline as a source of potential deal for us. As you know, we don't control those assets and they open the disposition on those assets the way we obviously do a wholly-owned bucket, though we do have certain governance rights depending on which joint venture it's in. And if we decide with the partner that it's time to exit those assets and some of those assets, obviously, we have high interest in, we certainly are in discussion with our partners for those properties. A lot of our legacy JVs are -- have assets that we're not interested in. And we think it's beneficial to take to the market and dispose of entirely, particularly as it relates to our current -- our core strategy. So yes, we have a nice list of assets that we like very much. No, they're not all on the market. No, our partner doesn't want to sell them off at this time. But that is a constant dialogue that occurs. And there's certain pressures being put on internally and externally with partners and with the markets that could bring those assets to bear at any time in the future. So it's something that's very, very important to us. It's important that we maintain our governance rights to the assets that we think are important to the franchise. And it won't be inconsistent with what you saw when we did the transaction with Blackstone and DRA and a few others that we really purchase assets out of ventures. So that will continue.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of the Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley.
Albert Lin: This is Albert Lin for Haendel. When we think about your disposition strategy going forward and the strong pricing that you're seeing in the B assets that you mentioned in your opening remarks? How do you think about balance between taking advantage of that pricing and making sure you have the right opportunity to redeploy that capital?
David John Oakes: I think you saw the perfect example of how we balance it with what we've announced so far this year. Where obviously, the ability to reinvest in a timely fashion is important, but even more important is the ability to reinvest in an attractive fashion. And so we did stomach some dilution for 2014, set-aside the increase our disposition budget both the Brazil sales but even more so the domestic assets where we've sold more or where we plan to sell more, and those sales are happening particularly early in the year. We will not compromise on the acquisition side, but we still think we have very credible acquisition targets that this company and this platform can execute upon. And so we made the challenging decision to accept a little lower growth in FFO per share this year because we thought the opportunity to sell more assets at attractive pricing was there. And so I think that's the most clear way to answer that question as well as how we think about it going forward, where the focus will continue to be on long-term growth, the risk profile of this company and that asset value per share growth much more than 2014 FFO per share.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Metz from UBS.
Ross T. Nussbaum: It's Ross Nussbaum here with Jeremy. I've got a question on Page 14 of your earnings package, here on the development side, specifically, you guys are showing just under $250 million of ground-up projects on hold, another $55 million of JVs. So my first question is can you give us an update on what the story is with those? And then the second part of the question is, at the bottom of that page, you're showing $206 million of booked value of land. Is that separate from the projects on hold, or is that sort of inclusive thereof? And maybe talk about all that.
Paul W. Freddo: Ross, it's Paul. First of all on the developments in progress and we talked about Kansas City, Kansas, which we've talked about before where we sold a big piece to Ikea to lead the project, and we'll be completing that this year. And Seabrook, it's a great story, that was a significant amount in our land-held for future development that we kicked off with the Wal-mart sale, and now we'll be opening a full prime power center this summer center with the like of Dick's, Michael's, Ulta, PetSmart, in addition to the Wal-mart Panera. So great stories. JV, there's one asset up in Toronto that we're still involved from a JV perspective, which will ultimately be a Target anchored center. So that will be preceding. I didn't follow the question specifically on the inclusion of the $240 million. But let me -- before turning it over to Dave, but I will update you on -- we will continue to make great progress obviously with that land, I think, leverage to sales to non-retail users or pay at sales or development. We have got a couple within that bank that we're talking about bringing that to the market in later this year or early next year, one in Florida, one in Connecticut. The environment gets better, the ability to develop gets better and we're making great progress in that regard.
David John Oakes: Yes. So Ross, on the other piece of it, yes, the $200 million is included in that overall $240 million, $250 million of overall projects that are still on hold. It is land spread across the country, North Carolina, Orlando, Connecticut, Chicago, a number of sites that were put on hold several years ago. But we do expect to be able to monetize over time. We do think they are appropriately valued on our balance sheet. But obviously, we're going to be prudent in putting additional capital into those then making sure that we got appropriate tenant interest, and making sure we have the appropriate use for that land relative to what might have been planned 5 to 15 years ago when that land was originally acquired.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jason White from Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: Just a quick question on your kind of landlord tenant balance of power and lease negotiations, and really what you're seeing today from qualitative and quantitative aspects versus call it 2 or 3 years ago, and what are you seeing swinging your favor other than just kind of market rents?
David John Oakes: Well, there's a number of things that are strong in our favor, and well, you see it the market, rents chase REIT. We really do have a very different portfolio than we had 2 or 3 years ago. So while tenant demand is great, and it's important to drive -- in order to drive rents, you need to have more than one person bidding on a space otherwise the leverage obviously swings the other way. The impact of the improvement of the quality of the portfolio, quite frankly, we underestimated. And -- or maybe said another way, we underestimated the drag that poor asset had overall on the portfolio. And I'll let Paul speak specifically to tenants, but I will tell you that the amount of interest that we have on a per space basis is somewhat unprecedented. Now one of the things you could say is that that's because there's no new supply and the supply demand dynamic has shifted very significantly in favor of the landlord. I don't think that's true through for B and C space, I think it's -- I think you have to combine the supply demand dynamic with the quality of the portfolio, and that's what's leading to the fact that we can lease 3 million feet of space in our first quarter, which is really unprecedented. And we're also in a position where we can drive rents. So quality of the portfolio, in addition to the supply demand dynamic, is what's really putting us in a position where we feel comfortable that we can sustain the growth that you've seen in the rental levels for quite some time.
Paul W. Freddo: Yes. Competition is clearly the key, and you can't overstate the demand that we're seeing from the best-in-class retailers. The initiative I talked about in the prepared remarks about proactive recapture of anchored space. This is not something we consider 4 or 5 years ago. I just couldn’t afford another legacy. Now it is how do we get -- first of all, we sit down with all of those retailers who are growing, and you hear us talk about them all the time. That was the TJs, or the Bed Baths, or the Dick's, and the Ross's of the world -- and the Rack's. And we know where they want to be, and to be in that position where we can help them get space through some of our proactive but less of initiatives is just -- it's wonderful spot to be in as a landlord with quality space.
David John Oakes: I think, Jason, just keep in mind, it's a pulse point. It is not that we're really all that smart, or we're guessing where they want to be. The relationship with the tenant is so important because #1, they can rely on us as to deliver of space on time, on budget when they need it, which is very important, certainty of execution is very important for the tenant. But the other side of it is, when they tell us where they want to be and the type of asset class that they want to be in, who the co-tenant should be and this is why. And they can explain to us the importance of the merchandising mix and cotenancy from a consumer lease activity standpoint. We don't have to do a lot of guessing. These retailers know exactly who the consumer is, where they want to go, how to reach them, the type of merchandise they want to see, what the product mix should be, et cetera. So we have the benefit of strong relationships that give us a competitive advantage in knowing what it is that we should be pursuing, to whom we should be leasing and what the centers and the quality of the merchandising should look like. So it's again paying attention to the market, and it's very, very important to do that right now more than ever, because as you know, the markets are moving incredibly fast. Retail is evolving at a speed we have never seen it before. And so it's even more important to stay in front of the tenant than ever before.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital.
David Bryan Harris: Dave, I have question for you and maybe I missed this, do forgive me. What was the Brazilian sale net to?
David John Oakes: It is $344 million of cash to us. So if you want to think about gross asset value, we are also reducing our amount of pro rata debt, because there is some net debt down essential but not significant of $344 million, is our net number, there is extremely little friction based on the structure and tax planning that we have done in getting that capital back to us. And so you're talking about basis points. If you're talking about friction off of that $344 million figure. So that's the right number to think about in terms of capital back to us and the reinvestment opportunity.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Just curious. In the quarter, it seems as if the tenant reimbursement rate was higher than usual, just curious if it was anything unique to the quarter?
David John Oakes: Yes. It's just going to end up being the controllable or the reimbursable expenses were higher, and so you see the proportion of variable expenses that the tenants reimbursed for were higher during the quarter. And so you see that reimbursement rate higher. It's absolutely our goal to minimize the volatility, maximize the predictability, both for purposes of the street as well as very importantly for purposes of the tenants, so they know what their costs are going to be. However, there are certainly certain periods of time where there is weather, other items that do lead to expenses being higher, but the strength of our leases and high quality and the high occupancy of our portfolio positions us to recapture. The overwhelming majority of that from the tenant. So that's why you saw expenses a bit higher, but also the reimbursement rates much higher.
Omotayo T. Okusanya: Is there something, I mean, are you changing the lease terms, I'm just kind of curious why is it just so unique to this quarter, and we should expect a higher reimbursement rate going forward or?
Daniel B. Hurwitz: No, any quarter can be a bit off, it's tough to learn too much from any one period, especially with the way that some of these expenses can be volatile. And obviously, accounting requires us to -- when we bill it, when we expect to receive it, it's all booked during that period. And so you do see some quarterly volatility, but I don't think we're pointing to any major change overall. Longer term, I do think a higher-quality portfolio will generate a higher reimbursement rate. And so over a long period of time, I think you continue to see gradual improvement with a better portfolio and more highly leased portfolio, but I wouldn't read too much into this quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets.
Richard C. Moore: I was looking at what Office Depot was saying yesterday. I think they're looking at closing 400 of their 1900 Depot-Max combination stores over the next couple of years, and I was curious, first of all, if you had heard from them about specific store closings in your portfolio? And then if you haven't, which I'm guessing you might not have, they said they want to close a 150 this year, and I'm thinking they'd probably do that with stuff, at least if they don't own it, that is near-term lease expirations, so I'm curious, what your lease expirations scheduled for those guys this year looks like?
David John Oakes: Yes, you're correct. What you're going to see this year is probably going to be a longer lease term, near-term lease expiration schedule. Couple of points to make with Office Depot, they have not identified about 400 at this point and they've been very clear about that. They're actually going through an extensive study as we speak. As we've talked about since the merger was first announced over a year ago, I mean, we see this as a tremendous opportunity. Clearly, a company that we've been in discussion with well ahead of any closing announcements that may come out of the announcement of 400 over the next few years. We never sit back, and we're certainly not sitting back in this Office Depot situation, waiting for retailers to contact us and tell us what they want to close, what they feel they need to close. Our approach is clearly to talk about spaces where we can work together, whether it's is downsizing, recaptures, or other deals we can make with them. And I would tell you, we're well ahead of the curve in knowing what's going to happen with the Office Depot portfolio within the DDR portfolio.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen and Company.
James W. Sullivan: I was curious, Dan and Paul, I guess the -- in your April 1 release, the 3 assets under agreement, one was identified as being in downtown Chicago, and of course, we tend not to associate downtown locations with power-center-type assets. As you continue to refine the portfolio, and I was curious of David's comments about lower prime assets being identified and put up to market -- put on market. I'm curious whether you're looking to be more urban, more dense, where demographics will be stronger perhaps, and in terms of where you want to put your capital, where you see better returns? And I'm curious, Paul, if you could kind of opine on this when you talk to retailers about where they want to be besides in your existing portfolio, are they skewing to more urban markets as well?
Paul W. Freddo: Let me start with that last piece, Jim, I mean urban is obviously a myth from many retailers out there. Very, very difficult to pull off. So I would tell you that across the board, the retailers we speak to will love an urban environment. I think of our midtown Miami project, which you certainly can consider very, very successful. In fact, a little piece in the journal this morning about how hot that market is in terms of residential and retail. We got a situation there with Loehmann's going out and the best-in-class price retailer coming in. That's an urban project. What we're talking about in Chicago is clearly a power center retailers we're talking about, that we deal with every day and that gets for example, TJ in a multi-level, but 2 level environment, works very, very well. So A, do they want urban, absolutely. Is there a lot of urban available, not at all. And where we see opportunities to deal with retailers, we deal with every day in an environment that works for us, we're going to look very hard at.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: The other thing to keep in mind about the urban, the reason why there's not a lot available, is that they typically how we subsidize deal. These are very expensive. Not only is the land is expensive, but the infrastructure becomes expensive, often requiring parking decks and lots of vertical transportation, et cetera. And a lot of the power center tenants, unless there's a subsidy available through our public-private partnership, et cetera, don't pay the rents that support that kind of development, which is exactly why you don't see to your point, a lot of these types of developments. That's also the reason why when we saw one that we really liked and they we're excited about, we jumped all over, because we think it's going to be extremely unique, similar to what we have, for example, if you look in Miami and our midtown Miami project, which has been great success. But complicated projects, dealing with the municipalities, dealing with the tenants, very difficult for the tenant to be able to get their proto-typical building under any construct in urban environment. So there need to be a lot of store planning and design revisions. So it's going to make this type of project very rare, and -- but also very valuable, which is why we felt excited and we were aggressive in pursuing it.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: I don’t know if I missed this, but I was just curious, after these $400 million dispositions are completed this year, wondering what -- where that would put your percentage of NOI from prime assets add, and given the demand that you're seeing for the B assets or the noncore assets, just curious if there's an opportunity to get rid of it all, or if that would even make sense, as that -- maybe that's a source of redevelopment opportunity?
David John Oakes: That non-prime buckets continues to get much smaller, the inventory there is down significantly. That said, we continue to refine our internal portfolio management process, where I don't think you're ever going to see it get to 0, because there's always going to be something then that we think we're best positioned to regrade to whether it's our exact old definition of non-prime or not, it represents either the greatest risk of the lease growth opportunity within the portfolio, and so I think we're going to continue to see a pool there. The great news is there's no pressure on us to have to generate liquidity through asset sales, the way that there would have been 5 years ago. And so to be there's a strong transaction market, which we would absolutely say that there is today. You'll see us execute on a larger volume of dispositions. In your past you heard us talk about our power center thesis in a major mispricing of the asset class, where you saw a significant net acquirers and so I think for us, there's going to be the constant focus on evaluating the opportunities within our portfolio, evaluating the opportunities within assets that we don't own but could acquire and then focus on the transactions market to see if it's the right time to be a net buyer or net seller, and we have found recently that accelerating that sales volume is the right thing to do. So based on simple math with a static portfolio, you could certainly see that pool of non-prime assets get down to 5% or so, remembering that some of those are held in joint ventures where our partners have considerable rights to hold those assets. So from a static pool, you'll see that percentage of non-prime assets get lower but I think, for us it's just a constant portfolio management process of saying where should we be taking capital from in terms of higher risks and lower growth assets in order to be able to reallocate that elsewhere, even if there is some timing lag associated with that.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Just a quick follow-up. I think, you mentioned 50% of your leases have options. I wasn’t sure if you meant if that's small shop and large, and could you just quickly describe what is the typical option look like to language?
David John Oakes: Yes. Typical option language keep would include 10% would be typical there. There's these differences, some larger, some little smaller, but 10% increases at the time of the options. So it's not like we're just renewing at flat-rates. Higher percentage of the box phase, we have options than the small shops. Gives us the ability to drive the higher rent per square foot. The smaller shops, average rent being north of 20%, and many of those that we got options, the box space with a lower rent, I'd say that's more a little higher than 50%, but overall, it's 50% across the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities.
Christopher R. Lucas: Guys you talked a lot about remerchandising of existing centers and the tenant demand for that. I have the question as it relates to new center development. And I guess, the way I want to think about this is, are you feeling any closer to having conversations with key retailers on new center development? And I guess, the question that sort of, the natural follow-up is, where are we as it relates to pricing, in other words what's that gap between the kinds of returns you guys would need to pencil in to actually do something and where the rents are from those anchors, and how is that trended, say, between where we are today and a year ago?
David John Oakes: Well, first of all, we're more focused on the ground-up development, Chris, it's been land that we held in our pool for a number of years. So if the economy improved, the markets improve, retail and demand is improved. We've seen the ability to get to that point where we can develop those at attractive returns. And so that's obviously means that the rents are continuing to grow. We did one project down in Charlotte that opened June of 2013, which is one of the brought out of private developer and jumped in and finished the project quickly at returns north of 10%. So we're seeing the rents get to a point where the discussions had heated up. I mentioned earlier on the call, about a couple of other pieces, one in Florida, one in Connecticut, where the demand, rents, competition for the space, as Dan talked about earlier, is now driving our desire to get those things out of the ground in the next 9 to 12 months.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think, its' important to know, Chris, to keep in mind that the reason why we're not seeing development isn't necessarily the gap in pricing between landlord and tenant. The pricing with retailers today is okay. You can justify reasonable market rents for a new development project. The problem that we face is #1, you have landownership who think their land is worth a lot more than it truly is. So that's not okay. So the pricing with the landowners is not okay, and the entitlement risk is not okay. So because that process in and of itself creates so much uncertainty that on a risk-adjusted basis, if you look at where you want to put your capital, the returns just aren't compelling. And pricing with retailers is just one small component, that's not small, it's important, but it's just one component of many that have to be factored into your risk-adjusted returns conversation. And while tenants sure would love to see some new product go up, because we have many tenants that are missing, their open to buy because there's not enough opportunity in the market. So they would obviously like to see new projects. And they're not going to pay above market, but they certainly willing to pay market rents. The other components necessary to bring a project out of the ground are still overly burdensome today, where we have other opportunities for our capital where we get a better risk-adjusted return. And I think that's going to continue for quite some time. One of the things you are seeing, you're seeing a little more development in the grocery anchor neighboring center category that doesn't compete with us, and we're seeing almost no new product in the power center category, and I think the reason why, is people just truly have better places to put their capital on a risk-adjusted basis.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Harris from Imperial Capital.
David Bryan Harris: I'm just wondering, in the context of the sales and liquidity that you referenced and you cautioned about redeploying capital, where do you think we're going to be on the net debt to EBITDA basis or any other metric that you might want to focus on from a balance sheet leverage perspective? And do you think, probably by year end as probably the time frame, and do you think -- where do you think you want to be with this company in the medium term on that ratio?
David John Oakes: Yes. Net debt to EBITDA, it's certainly something that we focus on and something that you've seen decline considerably over the last several years, and we never want it to be misunderstood that we think we're done yet. We think we're done with the dilutive part of it, but certainly not done with the continued improvement of this balance sheet. So from -- on a pro rata basis, including all of our pro rata share of joint venture debt, we're in mid-7s today, and we would expect that to get down to the mid-6s over a multiyear period in time, short-term as we sit on this additional liquidity, will make considerable progress on that, but we do expect to redeploy the majority of these proceeds. Over time, I also think there are just some things that, that calculation misses, whether it's one, the quality of the EBITDA that we're producing today, the longer-term duration that comes from higher credit quality tenants of higher quality centers. So it's not really more stable cash flow with cash flow or EBITDA that's much more likely to grow over time. But I think there are also just some simple definitional items there that are important to note such as -- there is no restructure in Brazil. There is no notion of a restructure being created in Brazil. That means, we were full corporate taxpayer down there, and so you can talk about EBITDA as much as you like, but that -- key is the taxes and we were absolutely paying those taxes. And so there are sales like that, that on a pure cap rate basis might show up as more dilutive to that metric where you're selling it around 8.5% cap rate versus the after-tax that your -- where your reinvestment hurdle for neutrality is really in the 7% range. And so, I think for us, it's the focus on the quality of the EBITDA, the quality and the duration of the debt, we'll continue to improve. But you'll also absolutely continue to see progress in debt to EBITDA and with the liquidity that we have today, you'll see that accelerating over the next couple of quarters although, as I mentioned, we do plan and hope to reinvest a large portion of that capital. And so, you won't see the entirety of that benefit over time, but you're certainly going to see a point or so lower debt to EBITDA over the next few years.
Operator: Our next question, will come from the line of Jim Sullivan from Cowen and Company.
James W. Sullivan: Yes. A very quick follow-up, and this is for you, David. The -- I think you made reference to some financing activity in Puerto Rico in your prepared comments, I could be wrong on that, but I'm just curious if you can help us understand whether there have been any recent data points, be it in terms of financing or transactions, that can help us understand where cap rates have been moving in Puerto Rico to the extent they are moving at all? And to what extent there's a spread between the U.S. cap rates and Puerto Rico?
David John Oakes: Sure. The bad news is we don't have grades recent empirical evidence either on the financing side or on the transaction side. And so there's nothing easy that we can point to the way that we can say cap rates for mainland assets have clearly gone down based on recent transactional activity. It's one of the reasons that you appropriately identify, we did make comments in the prepared remarks about pursuing a mortgage financing on an asset in Puerto Rico, just to highlight that lenders do continue to be focused on the quality of the asset and quality of the cash flows much more than the macro headlines regarding the island. We've heard some people ask the question that should we take muni bond rates in Puerto Rico and add some spread to that to think about what debt cost would be for an asset on the island, and then add something even to that to think about what cap rates would be on the island. And I think for us the importance, even in the position today where we have too much liquidity, the importance for us in executing on a new non-recourse, very standard mortgage loan on the island is simply to highlight that long term comfortably sub-4% debt does exist, and it is a lending -- group of lenders focused on the quality of the asset, the quality of the underlying cash flow is much more than the macro headlines. So no empirical evidence to say cap rates are here or there. But I do think lending costs are very comparable to major U.S. markets for quality assets, with comparable underlying U.S. tenants paying that rent. Historically, supply constraints have been dramatically higher on the island. And so we continue to think there are enough indicators that would say the opportunity for cash flow stability and considerable cash flow growth on the island is significant, and so cap rates shouldn't be any difference than what we've seen around the mainland U.S.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Just a single follow-up question to the earlier line of questioning on anchor development economics. How do you think about the prospect of the anchor boxes at malls, specifically the junior anchor and maybe reconfigured anchor boxes, spaces that could available. I think these are spaces that typically have very low in-place rent, and while CapEx is certainly needed to reconfigure them for a power center user, I would suspect landlords there are probably more have to do defensive deals and it could be something of a cheaper channel for new stores than ground-up construction, like, you see that with Dick's. Do you think that's a really tangible theme or do you expect that those opportunities are going to prove to be few and far between, just because power center tends to find the mall unappealing?
David John Oakes: We'll continue to see some of that, Jeff. But I would tell you that while I wouldn't classify it as few and far between we've been talking about the space that may become available in the mall sector for a lot of years now. Sears, Penny many are struggling anchor, they're still there, and I don’t see that space becoming available tomorrow. The retailers, the junior boxes that we speak with and meet with regularly will tell us that that's clearly not their first choice. First choice is going to be the power center format, that's where they grew, that's where they -- they made their markets, how their growing market share. There will be some situations and you mentioned Dick's, this is guy what their gallons takeover and other deals that made as Dick's, they got a little bit of a mall preference. But the preference is going to continue to be in the power center format, and I don't think we're going to see a great availability, other than maybe in some of the B and C malls and tertiary markets, but that's not where these best-in-class junior boxes are going to be focused.
Daniel B. Hurwitz: I think though as a practical manner, when you are on the retail side of the business, and you are faced with a decision of either missing a market or taking an unconventional or non-prototypical space, you have to really think hard about going into an atypical location and being flexible, and I think it just makes good sense for our center tenants to look at availabilities in malls, if in fact, they have no other way to effectively get into the market. So I don't see it as a competitor to space that we may have available, but I do see it as a viable opportunity for our tenants to continue to meet their open to buy needs, if in fact, they can't get into their preferred asset class. And that just makes good sense and there are people out there that are doing a terrific job in the B mall universe right now, spending lots of time with our tenants. So we know what's being discussed, our tenants discuss a lot of what's happening out there with us, and you don't give up markets, particularly if you have no new developments, or there's no new way get in. But tenants in our sector would prefer to see newer development, quite frankly, where they can put a prototypical box in which is the most efficient and also the most profitable box they can build. But that's just not happening, and I don't think that's going to happen. So I think the smart retailers today the once that grab market share should consider what's available in a regional mall, and a number of them are.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our questions. The presentation has now concluded. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
25,SITC,2,2014,2014-07-31 17:00:00,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and thank you for joining the Second Quarter 2014 DDR Corp. Earnings Call. My name is Ryan. I’ll be the operator on the event and at this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be opening the call to facilitate questions and answers. And at that time we do ask that you limit yourself to one question before putting yourself back into the queue. (Operator instructions) And as a reminder we are recording the call for replay. And now I will pass the call over to your host Ms. Meghan Finneran, Financial Analyst.
Meghan Finneran: Thanks, Ryan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, you will hear from CEO, Dan Hurwitz; Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo; and President and CFO, David Oakes. Please be aware that certain of our statement may be forward looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statement are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 as amended. In addition, we will discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplements are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it’s my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I’d like to start today’s call by reiterating that we are very pleased with the consistency and the strength of the operating results achieved during the second quarter, and the strategic transactions we announced since our last earnings release. Our second quarter results mark a pivotal point in the continued execution of our strategic plan as we closed on the sale of our investment in Brazil, identified an attractive user proceeds and formed our their joint venture with Blackstone to acquire prime assets and posted strong operating results with more than 3 million square feet of leasing completed in the quarter and new leasing spreads of 19%. While the near-term benefits of these accomplishments are obvious, the longer-term positive impact of this quarter will be realized for many years to come and significantly enhances our ability to focus on our core business. As the back-to-school season approaches, I’d like to take a moment to address the significance of this selling season, the impact it has on our retailers and the trends we are following in the market. Back-to-school was the second retail season of the year and a time when retailers are highly invested in their inventory level as goods have been purchased for both back-to-school and the Christmas Holiday by this point in time. Over the past few weeks we have seen a steady increase in retail sales due to improve weather, pent-up demand and those increased inventory levels at each of our retailers. As a result, retailers are beginning back to school sales earlier than in past years to further incentivize consumers to shop and realize gains and market share. Not all sales and promotional activity however should be viewed as an indicator that retail sales are in a slump and tenants are getting anxious to simply move product. In fact, most early promotions are well-planned and margins will be maintained for those retailers. With the highly promotional 2013 holiday season still linger, the consumer’s unwillingness to pay full price and the necessity of offering verifiable value, retailers are carefully planning their sales and product offerings as promotions remain the primary motivation for consumer spending. In regard to merchandising trends, we continue to observer strong demand for branded goods at discount prices further demonstrating our preference for merchants offering this product type. For example, we are witnessing value-oriented retailers such as Coles offering a much broader assortment of branded goods this back-to-school season. The back-to-school season is indicative of the coming holiday season and it will be very important to identify which retails won consumer dollars and which lost market share. After a long winter and spring and the slow transition into summer, the next few months will surely be an exciting time to study retail trends and follow merchandising strategies. Rest assured we will be spending a lot of time surveying the tenant universe through a variety of store visits. As we focus on the delivery of goods to the consumer, it is impossible and imprudent not to consider the impact of technology and the disruption it has had on the retail landscape over the past several years. Technology and retail has been and continues to be a significant topic of discussion and I’d like to take a few minutes to address the confluence of technology in the brick-and-mortar retail operations. As we continue to observe the lines of distinction between the physical store the virtual world blur, the retail industry is steadily undergoing a progressive transformation that is providing consumers with more convenience in value than ever before. From innovative mobile technology that continues to drive foot traffic and sales at bricks-and-mortar locations to buy online, pick in store and ship from store initiatives, brick-and-mortar retailers are continuously evolving their operational capacity. To date, retail efforts show real promise as they not only translate to enhanced operational efficiencies but also progressively fulfilling shopping expectations of the consumer. Overall, the impact of technology on our universe of retailers has been exceedingly positive. As the most successful and profitable retails of the industry continue to be those that have established both a strong physical and online presence and are striving to achieve an integrated omnichannel operating platform. One concept we continue to observe growth and expansion is that of buy online, pick up in store. Examples of tenants within our portfolio offering and continuing to roll out the convenience of buy online, pick up in store include Wal-Mart, Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond, PetSmart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe’s, DSW, Nordstrom Rack and Whole Fruits. We are also seeing our retail partners growing their ship-from-store initiatives which will allow stores to double as distribution facilities and offer retailers operational efficiencies that were previously unrecognized. Even fast casual restaurant tenants are realizing the advantages of investing in technology for the benefit of their brick-and-mortar operations, offering consumers the ability to place online and mobile orders for convenient pick up, Panera Bread and Chipotle represent two innovative fast casual operators leading the transformation with the restaurant sector. We continue to see significant investment activity from retailers and restaurant operators as they aim to provide consumers with desirable experiences associated with both the physical and the virtual realms. It is important to note that in the vast majority of cases, technology integration in the retail industry is focused on enhancing the bricks-and-mortar experience, whether synchronizing a website with local store inventory for successful buy online, pick up in store fulfillment, investing in an algorithm to launch an efficient ship from store program or developing a mobile application with an array of in-store capabilities, retailers investing in technology are directly investing in their physical presence. As our tenants in the retail industry as a whole continues to adapt and evolve in an ever changing environment, so too has our portfolio of prime power centers. As previously announced, we formed our third joint venture with Blackstone to acquire 76 shopping centers from ARCP for $1.975 billion. The 16.4 million square foot portfolio primarily consist of prime power centers located in large markets like Los Angeles, Houston, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington DC and Phoenix and is occupied by high-quality retailers including Whole Fruits, Trader Joe’s, The Fresh Market, Costco, Target, Wal-Mart, Coles, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and the TJX Companies. Within an expected closing of mid-September, this transaction further enhances our partnership with a best-of-breed capital partner as we again team up to create value in ways that align with our respective investment philosophies. This transformation showcases our continued ability to efficiently recycle capital and further advance our portfolio transformation. Having an underwriting history that dates back to several months prior to deal announcement, we have identified significant opportunities to enhance the value of the portfolio through active portfolio management. We are confident in our ability to generate outsized asset level growth by leveraging our proven operating platform and have appropriately structured our investment to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns while securing access to acquisition opportunities in the future. We look forward to maximizing value for our shareholders as we capitalize on the many opportunities available to us through the newly announced portfolio, our existing portfolio and the future opportunities that we are currently pursuing in the market. At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks, Dan. Strong leasing momentum continued in the second quarter resulting in 364 new deals and renewals for 3.1 million square feet matching the highest quarterly deal volume in company history. Similarly, spreads were also indicative of the strong leasing environment with an 18.8% pro rata new deal spread and 7.5% pro rata renewal spread. Our 2.4 million square feet of renewals represents that highest quarterly volume in company history and is further evidence that retailers are focused on securing high-quality locations in prime power centers. While I typically spend some time addressing the supply-and-demand dynamics, we all know that it remains heavily in the landlords favor as demonstrated by our quarterly results. Instead, I’d like to focus on how we’re taking advantage of this environment to continue to grow NOI and improve portfolio quality through our previously announced Project Accelerate initiative as well as ground up development. As we announced in late May and discussed with many of you at Nayreed [ph] Project Accelerate is allowing us to collaborate with retailers in the books, electronics, toys, office and traditional department store categories to regain control of locations in advance of natural lease expirations where we can then re-merchandise our assets with market share winning tenants and recognize rental upside of 30% to 40%. As we have discussed before, this is an ongoing multi-year initiative and we continue to work with these retailers on a regular basis to right-size their real-estate footprints. As such, in addition to the 21 previously announced recaptured boxes representing 550,000 square feet of prime power center space, we have finalized deals to recapture an additional five boxes totaling 160,000 square feet in prime assets in Boston, Miami, Charleston and Rowley [ph]. It’s important to remember that while we’re finalizing deals in 2014 to proactively recapture space, the benefits of the remerchandising and the mark-to-market opportunities will commence in the second half of 2015. Additionally, with the ability to know for certain which spaces we are recapturing, we have the ability to sign leases in advance of store closings, limiting the impact to our lease rate and resulting in minimal downtime. While we are certainly sensitive to our retail partners who have not yet informed their employees of specific store closing, I would like to provide a few examples of our success with this initiative. In the books category, we have several great examples underway. In one instance at a 530,000 square foot prime power center we’re backfilling a 24,000 square foot Barnes & Noble with Ulta and GAP Factory Outlet at a blended comp of 100%. This will enhance the center’s overall merchandise mix with two best-in-class retailers, drive NAV and provide enhanced credit quality of cash flow. In a separate 165,000 square foot prime power center, we are replacing a 23,000 square foot barns with a new Fresh Market at a 20% positive rent comp and introducing a grocery component to the center driving daily traffic. This will result in further upside in adjacent space as those leases come up for renewal and reduce the overall cap rate of the asset due to the market’s infatuation with grocers. In our final example, which takes place in a 1 million square foot prime power center we are splitting the 28,000 square foot barns box into several units featuring White House Black Market, Five Below and Carter’s resulting in a significant positive rent comp of over 130%, adding exciting new retailers to the mix and outperforming the original underwriting assumed at acquisition in 2013. In the office category, we have been strategically partnering with Office Depot as they right size their footprint. One example is the recapturing of a 23,000 square foot office max box at a 220,000 square foot prime power center acquired in 2013 providing the spark for a larger redevelopment. After recapturing this box, we will proceed with the downsizing of the adjacent and oversized DSW. With the office max recaptured and DSW downsized, we can then accommodate a Nordstrom Rack, dramatically improving the merchandise mix, credit quality and traffic at our center. Additionally, the new Nordstrom Rack deal represents an 80% rent comp on the office max space and 40% positive comp on DSW space. A second example is in a 435,000 square foot prime power center acquired in 2012 where we will recapture and split an Office Depot box for Ulta and Carter’s achieving a blended comp of 100% and driving both stability and growth well beyond our initial underwriting of this asset. While these are just a few examples of the types of deals we are making, they demonstrate that by recapturing below-market leases we are driving incremental growth, improving the credit quality of cash flow, further positioning our asset as dominant shopping centers, enhancing the merchandize mix offerings and eliminating potential risk with certain retailers. The list of retailers we are dealing with to back fill the recaptured space goes well beyond those named above and include Shoe Carnival, Cost Plus World Market, Total Wine, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Academy Sports, Ross, Marshalls, HomeGoods and many more. The concept of incentivizing our leasing team to create vacancy in highly unusual in our business, but it speaks to the opportunities presented by the current supply-demand dynamic and the dramatic transformation of our portfolio quality over the past several years. Also directly related to strong retail demand, one of the key takeaways from our 1,000 plus meetings at this year’s ICFD [ph] in Las Vegas, but that retailers are now willing to commit to new develop projects without requiring a major tenant. As a result, we’ve made exciting steps towards effectively monetizing our existing land bank through ground-up development and I’d like to take a moment to update you on that progress. For those in attendance at our Charlotte Investor Day this past October, you will recall Belgate Shopping Center which represented our first ground-up development in over four years. Belgate opened ahead of schedule in May of 2013 and is a 100% lease, 900,000 square foot power center located in Charlotte anchored by IKEA and a complimentary line up of junior anchors including Marshalls, Ulta, Old Navy, PetSmart, Cost Plus World Market, Hobby Lobby, Shoe Carnival. Given the project’s success, we are now finalizing a second phase of this project which will represent 75,000 square feet of space occupied with other best-in-class junior anchors while continuing to achieve an unlevered cash on cost return in excess of 10%. As you saw earlier this month, we announced the grand opening of Seabrook Commons, our most recent ground-up development project located Seabrook New Hampshire, a northern suburb of Boston. Seabrook Commons is a 96% lease, 380,000 square foot power center anchored by Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, PetSmart, Michael’s, Ulta, Famous Footwear and Five Below and includes a complementary restaurant line of consisting of Panera, Outback Steakhouse and Noodles & Company. The opening of Seabrook Commons which achieved an 8% unlevered return on incremental capital results in the second consecutive year that we have added a fully stabilized prime power center to the portfolio through ground-up development. In a few weeks, we will officially break ground on Gilford Commons, a 130,000 square foot power center consisting of three junior anchors including a specialty grocer and 40,000 square feet of shop and specialty space located just east of New Haven, Connecticut. With a planned opening in the second half of 2015 and projected unlevered incremental yield of 8%, this project will represent our third consecutive year of delivering a new ground-up development project. Lastly, we will be breaking ground on a multi-phase development project in Orlando, Florida later this fall with an expected opening of the first phase in fall of 2015. Once complete Lee Vista will span 450,000 square feet and will be anchored by theater or for a lineup of best-in-class junior anchor retailers and consist of an array of high-quality restaurant operators. This mix will take advantage of an abundance of surrounding office space, dense hotel offerings at close proximity to Orlando International Airport. Lee Vista will represent our fourth consecutive year of delivering a new group-up development project and we’re projecting an 8.5% yield on incremental invested capital. These strategic development projects enable us to assist the external growth aspirations of our retail partners, monetize our land bank and achieve attractive returns on incremental invested capital. As the supply-and-demand dynamic continues to heavily favor the landlord community, we are accelerating our efforts to take advantage by being extremely aware that our industry is cyclical and opportunities are often fleeting. As highlighted by Project Accelerate, our recent ability to generate new NOI through ground-up development and our previously discussed $1 billion redevelopment pipeline, we are continuing to find creative ways to grow NOI, improve merchandise mix, enhance credit quality of cash flow and expand the overall market share of our portfolio, all in an effort to not only benefit from the current landlord favorable environment but also to deliver long-term stability in any economic environment. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $101.3 million or $0.28 per share for the second quarter including non-operating items. FFO for the quarter was $82.1 million or $0.23 per share. Non-operating items primarily consisted of impairments related to land held for development that is currently being sold. The second quarter was again representative of DDR’s execution of its strategic transactional and balance sheet objectives. First, we closed on the acquisition of four prime power centers, three of which were sourced off market for $265 million. These acquisitions were focused in the top-30 MSAs and included anchors such as Target, Costco and Whole Fruits. The most significant acquisition was the Maxwell, a 240,000 square foot prime plus power center locate Chicago South Loop. The Maxwell features an impressive lineup of junior anchors including Nordstrom Rack, Dick’s Sporting Goods and T.J. Maxx sits directly adjacent to Whole Foods and offers a demographic profile of household incomes on $105,000 and population of 681,000 people in the trade area. DDR previously made a $21 million mezzanine loan on the project that was accompanied by advantageous acquisition rights allowing for a seamless acquisition prior to completion and stabilization, with additional upside for DDR given the 90% lease rate. We closed on the acquisition in May for $118 million and we expect the majority of the NOI to come online in the fourth quarter of 2014. The acquisition was partially financed by the issuance of 1 million OP units in order to provide tax efficiency and the remainder of the acquisition was financed through asset sale proceeds. Another acquisition that I would like to highlight is Waterstone Crossing [ph], a 425,000 square foot prime power center in Cincinnati that is anchored by Target and Costco. DDR sourced the acquisition off market as a result of a strong local relationship which allowed us to achieve much more attractive pricing than a marketed sale for a class A center in a large market, providing for significant net asset value creation before we even plug the center into our platform. DDR not only achieved favorable pricing but we will look to increase the yields by bringing in top-tier organic grocer to the asset in the coming months to replace a weaker merchant. We also announced that we have formed a 95-5 joint venture with Blackstone to acquire 76 assets from American Reality Capital Partners for $1.975 billion. The acquisition is scheduled to close in late 3Q, subject to loan assumptions. Consistent with previous acquisitions and joint-venture with Blackstone, DDR secured acquisition rights to the top-tier assets which represent 10 of the 76 assets with over 40% of the total value. As Dan mentioned, this transaction continues to build on our deep relationship with Blackstone and highlights the partnership’s ability to source off-market opportunities below market pricing. On the domestic disposition side we sold 11 operating assets and six land parcels or $51 million at DDR share and we currently have $335 million of operating and non-producing assets under contract for sale. Additionally, we also completed the sale of our Brazilian investment for net proceeds of $344 million, a transaction that dramatically simplifies our company and decreases our risk profile. The remaining wholly-owned non-prime assets now consist of only 32 assets, down from nearly 200 shopping centers at the end of 2009, and all of which are either being marketed for sale or a subject to either pending leases or anchor rollover in the short term. Regarding disposition pricing, for the full year 2014, we estimate a blended cap rate in the low 7% range comprised of mid-7% pricing on operating assets that we are selling into a strong market as well non-producing land. On the capital market side, DDR also notes the closing of a $75 million nonrecourse mortgage loan secured by Plaza Escorial and 636,000 square foot shopping center in Puerto Rico. The loan was completed with a leading life insurance company and included a 7-year term and a fixed interest rate of under 3.6%. The financing highlights the strong property level supply-demand fundamentals and the attractive financing environment that continues to exist on the island despite the macroeconomic headwinds. In July, DDR paid off a $304 million balance of the [indiscernible] and previously secured 27 prime assets and a loaned value in the 30% range further reinforcing our desire to grow the sides of our unencumbered tool, which now stands at $6.5 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2009. Disposition proceeds and plus the carry on [ph] loan were immediately utilized to repay the [indiscernible]. However, we will look to issue long duration on secured bottom [ph] in the second half of 2014 to replace the CMBS debt at a comparable rate. Finally, as a result of the significant transaction and capital markets activity, I would like to address DDR’s sources and uses of capital for the remainder of 2014 and the subsequent impact on operating FFO guidance. As we currently stand, we are on target to exceed our current guidance for both acquisitions and disposition activity. Year-to-date, we are closer on a contract to acquire $296 million of one off acquisition plus $384 million associated with DDR share on the ARCP acquisition totaling $680 million. Disposition activity including assets under contract includes $548 million domestically and $344 million in net proceeds associated with the sale of our Brazilian investment totaling $892 million. The transaction activity highlights DDR’s desire to be a net seller in 2014 given a strong pricing environment and further reinforces the lack of need for equity issue in trade or transactional activity or debt repayment for the remainder of the year. For some recent commentaries that encourages us to remind analysts and investors that neither investment nor refinancing activity will be funded from our line of credit for a long period of time. So it is much more appropriate that we might have a long-term debt issuance in the next several quarters. At this point, I’ll stop and turn the call over to Dan for closing remarks.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thanks, David. Before turning the call over to questions, I would like to let you know that we are planning to host a property tour in Atlanta on November 4th in conjunction with Navy [ph]. As many of you know, Atlanta represents our largest market by square footage and second largest market by base strength and highlights numerous assets that clearly illustrate our investment thesis. Following the tour, we will host a dinner during which you will have unlimited access to ask senior management team as well as our local management team from our Atlanta office which is responsible for 116 assets totaling more than 30 million square feet in Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia. We look forward to our productive day and exchanging thoughts with those of you who can make the trip to Atlanta that would like to join us. Again, thank you for joining us today. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first questions come to you from Christy McElroy with Citi.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Daniel Hurwitz: Good morning.
Christy McElroy: As recourse is built out there by online and pick up in a store and other initiatives, the high eCommerce, the bricks and mortar, Dan, as you talked about, are you finding any changes in retail or space needs at the center level or any differences in the way even with retailers are kind of looking at their space needs in a specific market as stores become increasingly a method for distribution?
Daniel Hurwitz: That’s a great question, Christy, because it is something we discussed with a number of our retail partners now. And it’s really not a function of space needs. It’s how they’re going to configure the space to make the experience pleasant for the customer. Right now, as many of you know, in order to pick up goods or to experience the shop online pick up in store program, you either have to go into the store specifically and then in which point there’s someone to assist you to your car with whatever good it is which is not really convenient or you have to go to the back of the store where the dock is and unpleasant things like dumpster and bailers and things of that nature. So natural physical presence of the store is in question and how they layout the store and how they make a customer pick up experience pleasant is a topic of conversation for sure. And there’s no great answer yet to how to do that, although, one of the things that we are seeing is for those of you who are old enough to remember the Sears catalog and JC Penny catalog and Montgomery Ward catalog, et cetera, where they had specific areas for catalog people to pick up goods at the store, that does give you a clue as to probably we’re going back to the future if you will in a lot of those types of environment. So I do think that we’re going to continue dialog with retailers on this. I don’t think there’s an easy answer to it. But I think there will be not necessarily square-footage reductions or expansions, but there will be different space layout to try to create an environment that is exceedingly convenient for the consumer to come to the site, go to the store, pick up the goods, get in and get out quickly with the merchandise. And I think it will require us to make physical changes to some of our shopping centers and physical changes to the overall experience in the near future.
Christy McElroy: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes to you from Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning. Jeremy Metz with Ross. You guys talked about a number of developments you have going on. Can you just talk about what sort of spreads versus acquisitions you are underwriting today? Is that higher than say a year ago? And then just more broadly where institutional assets are trading on a cap rate basis today and if that’s compressed further?
David Oakes: Sure. As we referenced a little bit in the opening commentary and certainly it hopefully shows up in our actual transaction activity, the private market for quality shopping centers is extremely hot, it’s extremely competitive. There is a reasonable amount of product being listed, but it’s being overwhelmed by the amount of capital that’s looking at the space. And so the acquisition environment is very competitive, very challenging, that’s why you saw our activity for this quarter dramatically more focused on off market opportunities, more opportunities where we had some sort of advantage on the deal and that’s why we were pleased with the acquisitions that we created that we were able to complete this quarter. But that’s why you don’t see us out actively winning a great majority of the deals that we looked at. We’d say at this point, quality power centers are clearly trading no higher than the low six cap range and seeing many, many more deals not just in the beloved coastal markets but in a broader list of markets and not trading below 6% cap rate. And so an extremely competitive environment for acquisitions. We had sought other places to invest our capital. In some cases, it just means a timing issue where we’re patient and we’re disciplined and we’ll wait to put that capital out where we do find opportunities. In other cases it means that capital gets redeployed in a redevelopment activity which we’ve talked about quite a bit or some of the new development activity that Paul referenced to where I think consistently we are talking about getting 250 basis points or more of expected return beyond where we think those assets would trade in the private market. Obviously, there are some development risk in the projects we’re talking about, but we’re more discussing projects where we already own the land, is already entitled land, we think you’re talking about a considerable development spread there where you’re only taking a fraction of the traditional development risk if we were to be going out and buying unentitled land to work that to the process where we would need an even wider spread for that sort of activity.
Jeremy Metz: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning out there. Just a question, if you look at a number of the expanding concept like store [ph] cycle and the ballet concept and yoga, et cetera. And then you also see that expanding dental chains and things of that sort. Are retailers more accepting of those sorts of contract, co-locating it as the showing centers or are they still resistant because of legacy parking concerns or rather issues like that.
Paul Freddo: It’s gotten better Alex in terms of the retailer’s acceptance. I believe you mentioned a couple of different concepts. So I would have a separate dental from fitness especially some of the smaller fitness users like life cycle. The retailers have gotten to accept the L.A. Fitness of the world certainly not so of the huge, lifetime fitness type units. [Indiscernible] has become very common in a lot of shopping centers, well-planned and well-positioned is the key. That’s the comment we get back a lot of the time when we’re asking for consent for some of the ready to wear merchants or other anchors in our centers. So to position properly, it seemed they have their own parking, a terrible influence on the parking lane from the store, they’re accepting. Dental, medical, that’ a different thing you’re going to have some centers where there is some small shops base, or some outline space that makes sense for. But we’re not excited about putting that in line with our traditional retail centers anywhere and then we’d like to keep it in an off location if you will. And again, I don’t think you can compare the two uses.
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, I think the short answer, Alex, is yes. People are more – the retailers are more accepting. But particularly for the medical use, we’re not more accepting. And while certainly there are certain centers where that maybe appropriate, in most cases we’ve determined that those are centers that are non-prime and those are centers that we should shell. And so we are not actively in that market because once you go non-retail for a shopping center – and there are obviously certain services – fitness is one and there’s other spaces that are difficult to lease that may be appropriate. But once you go to the medical field and that becomes a major priority for a shopping center, it’s going to be very difficult to maintain the retail presence in the market share gains and achieve market share gains that you like. And we typically put those centers on the sale list and we’ve had success obviously selling them. And as you can tell where our leasing numbers without doing those deals, we’re doing just fine. Leasing to the people that we want to lease to. So we really haven’t needed to go to that level. And I don’t suspect that we will anytime soon.
Operator: And our next question comes to you from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: Thank you and good morning.
Daniel Hurwitz: Good morning.
Craig Schmidt: The top national retailers continue to grow its market share of the total shares, I’m just wondering what this means by shopping center format and particularly what that might mean for small shops in shopping centers.
Daniel Hurwitz: Well, you want to see in our case anyway, Craig, where the small shops are becoming less relevant. The power center format, let me start with that, we don’t have a lot of small shops space. We think about it in small grocery and the local community centers. So we’ve been very focused on taking it to the point you’re talking about where we’re consolidating shops space, bringing in some of the national anchors, converting 3,000-foot units to one 9,000-foot unit. So you will see a reduction in it. I think the key in our business and certainly the way I look at it is, how much office space should any center have, right? And it’s not going to be a big component when you talk about the power center format. So we’re going to focus on the national retailers. We’re going to focus on the large 10,000 and up primarily. Certainly there’ll be some smaller that complement the mix. But we will see less and less shop space. And that is a little bit of a function of what’s happening with the business. There’s always going to be room for service and food, fast food particularly, some of the cell phone operators. So you will see shop space in all sort of categories. But in what we’re doing and what we’re focused on, we’re not going to see a heavy concentration of how to build the shop space as we used to know it.
Operator: Next question is from Kalan Beril [ph] with Goldman Sachs.
Kalan Beril: Hi, good morning. Is Dollar Tree on your list of largest tenants? And I’m sure you also have exposure to Family Dollar. Could you talk about any impact you expect the merge of those two companies to have on their square-footage plans?
David Oakes: Yes, Dollar Tree is quite a large player on our portfolio. But there is only one Family Dollar, so impact in terms of the merger. And we think it’s a great idea. I think that we’d like to see this growth exposure in some of our markets. Eighty-six is the number of Dollar Trees we have today. So again, just with one Family Dollar, we’re up to 87. And again, no impact on the merger in terms of growth
Daniel Hurwitz: And we think the merger is a positive thing. When you have multiple retailers in the similar category with a similar pricing strategy, it makes sense for them to join forces. We’ve seen it with Office Max and Office Depot. We thought that was a good idea. And we certainly think that this is a good idea as well. We think that in general, though, one of the reasons why these events occur is because if you look at the companies individually, both of them had very, very high aspirational new store GLA growth strategies. Both of which were going to be extremely difficult to achieve on an independent basis particularly as we have rising occupancy rates. We have nothing new being built. And finding the square footage necessary to sustain those growth aspirations was going to be very, very difficult and I think near impossible. So I think as the combined chain looks for its growth opportunities, it is more likely to succeed in the guided square footage that they have planned than they would individually. And I think that was a big part of the conversation that leads to the merger because retailers as you know have to grow internally or externally. But internally is tough. Internally is tough in a non-inflationary environment. So external growth is actually critical for a successful retailer and growing market shares is absolutely critical. And independently when very little is being built and the supply-demand dynamic is they heavily favor the landlord, joining of the forces in that effort makes a lot of sense.
Operator: Next is Jonathan Pong with Robert Baird.
Jonathan Pong: Hey, good morning, guys. Dave, S&P has a positive outlook on your credit rating. Can you share anything about how those discussions are going [indiscernible] it will be and then what’s the biggest hurdle to getting that done?
David Oakes: Yes, I mean the outlook is obviously very important to where their headed that in terms of their bent to continue to have the rating more positively reflect our credit. They do very critically their own research. We try to be as open in front of them as possible with our disclosure that we share with everyone as well as with specific rating agency, business and disclosures. So we have no secret intel as to what their plans are, but obviously I think we keep making considerable progress, de-risking the company. That includes lowering debt to EBITDA, but a much broader list of de-risking activities like the Brazilian exit. And so we think as we continue to make progress, the rating agencies have recognized that we think they’ll continue to recognize that maybe even more importantly, I think if you look at where our bonds [indiscernible] the fixed income investment community has certainly been supported of our name that I think positions as well when we choose to return to the bond market.
Operator: Next comes through from Albert Lin with Morgan Stanley.
Albert Lin: Hey, good morning guys. Year-to-date, I think you guys are attracting around 3.2% same stores NOI growth which is slightly towards the higher end of your full year guidance, 2.5% to 3.5%. I’m curious what your thoughts are for the back half of the year. And how long do you think you can sustain this level of plus 3% NOI growth?
David Oakes: We’re please with that activity for the first half of the year. I would call it very consistent to modestly ahead of that guidance range. And we think it continues to be achievable for the second half of the year. I think everything we talked about for use of the upgrade of the portfolio quality with the upgrade of the underlying tenant base was meant to create a portfolio that could deliver this. And while there is much debate in the past as to whether our portfolio quality warranted pricing on par with the other shopping center companies, I think as result show up, it becomes harder and harder to justify the discounted which we trade. When you see that the underlying cash flow does not only grow on part and better than peers, but also I think represented the sort of consistency that is important to us and we think important to what stocks get attracted multiples or NAV premiums or small NAV discounts over time. And so we’re pleased with the activity to date. We think everything that we put in place with the portfolio as well as the leasing team not only the caliber of the people we have but the mandate that they very clearly have from all of us to continue to drive growth that focus on project to accelerate, to find those opportunities where we can create additional rental spreads, creating year [indiscernible] over and prove the quality and value of the portfolio, but also absolutely push things to NOI. Now counter intuitively, it may have a slight negative impact in 2014 where we’re creating vacancy or at least in the first half of 2015. But we think even with that, we can maintain very attractive same store NOI growth on an absolute basis in this 2.5% to 3.5% range and I think very attractive same store NOI growth relative to the peer group.
Operator: Next question comes from Jason White with Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: Hi, guys. Just a follow up on the previous discussion over [indiscernible] some of the [indiscernible] and some of those hands in your centers. How will you be able to add the specialty grocers and with the parking they demand, is it hope to find the place to fit them in your centers or is it pretty easy to restructure some of the other retailer’s expectation?
Paul Freddo: It’s actually been quite easy Jason. I mean, most of the specialty grocers [ph] we’ve done have been takeovers of existing space. Like the one example I gave with a fresh market where we’d be taking a Barnes location, fit into the exact footprint, no expansion, no reduction necessary. And Barnes and some of the other spaces we have recaptured, they were very demanding in the amount of parking in front of their stores initially. So we’ve got plenty of parking and then we’re [indiscernible] to fill those folks like the specialty grocers. But we don’t see any issue in terms of the parking demand at all. In fact, many of the centers we’ve built, we’re probably over-parked and now coming in with somebody who’s going to use up a little bit of that parking is a great add to the center.
Operator: Next we have Todd Thomas with Keybanc.
Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks, good morning. Dan, in light of your comments around the retail environment, you noted that you’re spending a lot of time analyzing retailers promotional campaigns and inventory levels and merchandising. And we’ve seen a modest uptick in bankruptcies and closures this year relative to prior years. Your comment seems to be focused more on the importance of this back-to-school and holiday season. I was just wondering, do you feel that this season is more important than in recent years for many retailers, maybe a tipping point of sorts or a situation where things shake loose a bit with regard to closure or even bankruptcies. I was just curious if you could elaborate a bit on your comments.
Daniel Hurwitz: Sure. I don’t think this season is any more important than any other season from that perspective. Particularly because I think in general, if you look at the bulk of our cash flow and the credit quality of our cash flow, the tenants are going into this holiday season in good shape. Balance sheets are in good shape. I think they’ve figured out obviously, over the last several years, regardless of the news we heard yesterday, they figured out how to operate in a low GDP environment with modest wage growth and modest employment growth. And I think they’re well prepared for the holiday season and we’re all prepared for back to school. I think what’s interesting though and we did a property tour up to New England the last two days. And one of the things you are seeing is that inventory levels and promotional activity in retailers is early. It was early for back-to-school and I suspect we’ll see the same thing now for the holiday season. We’ve always waited sort of for after Thanksgiving and then everything moved to before Thanksgiving and I think everything is accelerating a week early or two early. And I think that’s a result of the inventory levels. I think it’s a result of the cooperation between the vendor and the retailer and the fact that the consumer isn’t skittish. The consumer smart and the consumer doesn’t like to pay full price and they need to be incentivized to shop and the retailers are figuring out how to do that. So I don’t really think this is any more important than any other important selling season. But I do think that you will see some changes in inventory levels. You will see some changes in promotional activity. I also think that we saw some changes in merchandise mix because of the importance of branded good off price. And that’s just something to watch, to see if it works quite frankly. To see if it’s the right move and to see if that’s what the consumer is looking for as we head into the two most important shopping seasons which obviously are back to school and holiday.
Operator: The next question is [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning everyone. I just want to go back to follow your comments about project accelerate. I appreciate the details and some of the examples you shared. I was just curious though, if we take a step back and think about 21 recaptured boxes and the five that are being recaptured. Of those, how many are released at this point and how many have you actually taken back at this point.
Paul Freddo: Basically, we’ve only taken back one but they’re happening – they’d staggered [indiscernible] and that’s part of the beauty of this. Part of our deals on the 26th now are controlling exactly when we will we get the space back and made the point that we want to be in a position where we’re signing leases with the replacement tenant prior to physically getting the space back. There will be a few more in the third quarter, several more by the end of this year. Pretty decent wave of recaptures early in 2015. And David mentioned, obviously, there will be a little bit of a hit with that. The stuff we haven’t captured, we have certainly concrete ideas on every one. Deals are not done with all 26 but we’re recapturing for a reason. We want that space. And so in many cases – and if I just had to give a percentage I’ll tell you 50%. We’ve got deals soon to be executed and the others are in LOI and negotiation stages but very comfortable with the space.
Daniel Hurwitz: I think it’s very important to note to Paul’s point though is that we will stagger the take-backs. And in most cases, we will have signed leases before we actually take back the space because our agreements with these retailers give us the optionality of when we can take it back, obviously giving consideration to their peak sales times et cetera. So we will stagger it out to minimize the downtime as much as possible or maximize the cash flow as much as possible. But we’re in a good shape from a documents standpoint. So there are optionality on these spaces is what’s really creating enormous value. So as we announce these deals and as these deals come through, you will actually see deals that are signed, ready to go but might not have taken back the space yet. And we still have some time before we do that.
Operator: Next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. Along that similar lines. I feel like [indiscernible] there’s still maybe 25% of space that’s not owned by you. What are your plans on those types of spaces. And does that make sense for you to take some of those back into the own portfolio.
Daniel Hurwitz: The one you’re looking at is typically where you have a shadow anchor whether it’s a Target or a Lowe’s or Wal-Mart. And we have looked in certain cases where it makes sense to convert to lease. But that’s not typically the preference of those larger retailers.
Paul Freddo: Yeah. You think about some of the costly capital standpoint as much as our positioning has dramatically improved in capital, the decrease, it’s a real struggle to say that are our cost of capital could compete with the Costco or a Wal-Mart who have consistently wanted to own a larger portion of their store base. At least for Wal-Mart’s large format stores.
Operator: Next question is from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan.
Michael Mueller: Hi. I was wondering for the Blackstone [ph] JV, did you consider taking, I guess, a higher ownership stake initially or not really because you have access to the top 10 centers that you wanted anyway.
Daniel Hurwitz: I think the importance for us is the risk-adjusted return. And so to be able to get a very low-risk return on a preferred equity piece for a period of time during which we’ll be doing the extremely detailed underwriting above and beyond what you do in an acquisition process but what you do when you truly own and manage a center to see what would make sense. Assuming we can figure out another transaction with Blackstone to take several of those assets on a wholly owned basis. I think it speaks to our focus on risk overall. Our focus on portfolio quality overall where we didn’t have an interest to take on 100% of these 76 assets. But we think we have a very attractive structure here where we absolutely expect to help our good partners at Blackstone on this transaction and end up at the day with something that works extremely well for them and very well for us when we can achieve a good return and a consistent return up front. And potentially, an ownership interest of 100% of the smaller pool of highest quality prime assets. Do we want longer term? So there’s a structure that’s worked well. They are a partner that has worked extremely well, and so we’re excited to another one with them. And hopefully, we see it progress over the next several years the way that the first one has.
Operator: Next we have Christopher Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Christopher Lucas: Hi. Good morning everyone. I just wanted to [indiscernible] on the last question which is David, maybe you could give us a sense of the aspirates between [indiscernible] in that ARCP portfolio.
David Oakes: I think there is a relatively widespread when you simply say there are 76 assets. When you truly look at where the value is focused, I think it’s pretty tightly focused on high quality shopping centers in major market. But to answer the most extreme thought of your question, I think there are high quality, major, major market asset that recent transactional activity would tell us our five caps or some five cap sort of assets in the Los Angeles area. And on the other end, there are some smaller market, single time in assets with less attractive demographics are underlying tenancy. They would probably be in the mid-eights. And so I think you do have a wide range of cap rates by that broadest definition of thinking about each one of the 76 assets. But when you truly look at where the value is, it is highly concentrated in the high quality major market prime, large scale power centers.
Operator: Next we have Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Hi guys. Good morning. Hey, I’m curious, now that development seems to be making its way back into the conversation not just with you guys but with others as well, where you are in terms of your development platform, in terms of your staff, your expertise, say, which of course you’ve had before. And I’m wondering where that is today post recession from a development standpoint.
Daniel Hurwitz: We’re in good shape, Rich. And we had the redevelopment platform and we were very careful as we went in to the recession and during the recession. We knew we needed the development folks in the department and we kept a couple of key ones and we’ve added since. And we continue to look by the way. We’re always looking for quality people in that area, construction and development but we’ve kept enough of a pool of activity, if you will, going with the redevelopment pipeline and the occasional development that we feel good about where we are. We continue to look. We certainly don’t feel that we’re in a position where we’re short on quality staff for the extent of the pipeline we played out for you.
Operator: And it looks like we have some follow-up coming through from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust Robinson.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a quick question, a follow up on Rich’s. What do you think – have you guys looked at your total portfolio and just maybe put some parameters around what you think the total redevelopment opportunity is, maybe within the next three years or so?
Daniel Hurwitz: Yes, we have. I mean, there’s quite a bit that’s active today. I will tell you that we’ll be north for bringing about $100 million plus online in ‘14. And that number should be right around 150.15 million. That’s kind of the run rate we’re looking at. It could obviously bury it from year to year based upon when projects are brought into service. So we’ve got several hundred million in progress right now, different stages. That just means we’re not just thinking about it. We’re actually doing something about it whether it’s entitlements or consents or working deals. But a good run rate would be about 150 million to 200 million a year of activity and probably bringing in around 150 million a year for the next few years.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue, so I’ll pass it back to DDR CEO Dan Hurwitz for any final remarks.
Daniel Hurwitz: I just want to thank you all once again for joining us for our update on what was a busy second quarter. And hope that you will be able to join us in Atlanta on November 4th in conjunction with Navy. So thanks again. Have a good day.
Operator: Wonderful. Thank you very much for your time. [Indiscernible] and have a great rest of the day."
26,SITC,3,2014,2014-10-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 DDR Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mark and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today Meghan Finneran, Financial Analyst. Please proceed.
Meghan Finneran: Thanks Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us.

Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it’s my pleasure to introduce our CEO, Dan Hurwitz.
Daniel Hurwitz: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Before I address the very successful quarter and the market we are seeing going forward, I’d like to share my thoughts with you in regard to this particular form and thank each of you for your many contributions to DDR over the years. While this is certainly not an official goodbye I thought it appropriate and want to make sure that I have the opportunity to properly recognize this process which has been essential to our Company’s evolution. When I was named CEO I felt it was important to personally reach out to the various constituents of the public markets, including investors, analysts and rating agencies to begin a dialogue that focused on our management team’s renewed vision for the future of the Company, while simultaneously ascertaining your respected view of that vision. My goal was to engage with the market, not quite the market, while listening and expecting your intellect and opinions. But still holding firm to what history taught this management team over the years. Most importantly as a leader of this team, I believed it critical that we build a culture that emphasize delivery of what was promised and in so doing earned back the respect of those whom we disappointed in the past. While I certainly, won’t go through the various successes and failures over the past several years. I think it’s very important that each of you on this call understand the quintessential role that you played in our success. You’ve challenged us, doubted us, criticized us, praised us and most importantly educated us on what it would take to bring this Company not only back from the brink, but importantly enhance our reputation market perception and credibility. Whether it was through the 100s of meetings with investors and analysts annually, or through your generous commitment of time to participate in perception studies whatever success we attained it is directly attributable to our partnership with you and for that we are all extremely appreciative and we’ll be forever grateful. While we may not have always agreed on all matters, direction or message, the respect level was evident and our conversations were meaningfully constructive. I believe DDR is an excellent example of how a transitional company and public market constituents can work together to save an institution, preserve several 100 job and set a path for future stability and prosperity for all involved. So as my time to address you in this form becomes somewhat limited, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to thank you for being the professionals that you are. Thank you for helping a first-time CEO, find success under difficult circumstance and thank you for enabling me to leave this company to my successor in infinitely better shape than I found it, which should be the ultimate goal of every CEO. Most importantly thank you for your support of the entire management team at DDR, who remained laser-focused on ensuring that this Company’s best days are yet to come. As we move forward with the call, I ask that you respect the fact that none of us here in the room today are part of the selection process for my successor. So please let’s spend our remaining time today talking about the business and the continued excellence and consistency produced by our team. As you saw on our earnings release last night we had another outstanding quarter. Our portfolio continues to be in high demand from retailers resulting a consistently strong same-store NOI growth, pre-recession leasing spreads and incremental gains in portfolio occupancy. Our retail partners continue to aggressively pursue and win market share through disciplined and thoughtful new store growth, coupled with complementary omni-channel investments making the power center assets class the most desired format for retail growth across the country. The supply demand dynamic has never been more in our favor and our capital recycling program and portfolio transformation has left us with a portfolio of power centers that are in high demand from many of the best and most successful retailers. From specialty grocers to fast fashion to beauty and cosmetics, the power center format continues to evolve with the convergence of concepts and merchandise, while offering retailers the greatest access to the consumer and simultaneously protecting their margins due to the advantageous cost structure of our asset class relative to other retail formats. In an era of cost conscious and margin focused retailers, power centers continue to gain in popularity with growth conscious retailers as was recently reiterated during Ulta's Investor Day just a few weeks ago. These dynamics have resulted in a dramatic increase in the credit quality of our cash flow, coupled with a simplified structure and streamline business model, our portfolio is positioned to withstand any economic environment and provide durability, consistency of earnings and strong dividend growth for our shareholders. Looking across the retail real-estate industry more specifically, it is highly fragmented particularly in the power center space. Our portfolio management team recently completed a study of the ownership of the entire power center universe. There were nearly 115,000 retail properties in the domestic U.S. totaling 9.6 billion square feet. Looking at the power centers specifically, there are approximately 7,000 power centers representing nearly 2.4 billion square feet or 25% of the entire retail real-estate universe. That makes DDR share of the power center market only 4% by square footage. If you would add together all the power center portfolios of the largest public shopping center REITs in our sector collectively we own only 12% of the power center universe based on square footage. The fragmentation in the power center space creates enormous opportunity for consolidation and one should expect those potential acquisitions to be aggressively pursued by our team. So, for these reasons and many others, I remain very optimistic about the future of the power center business and of course DDR in particular. We've built an outstanding team, our portfolio and balance sheet had never been stronger and our retail partners continue to win market share. As I think about my transition, I can't help but recall a quote about leadership and team building from one of the greatest business leaders of our generation Jack Welch. Welch stated, “Before you're a leader success is all about growing yourself, when you become a leader success is all about growing others”. With that goal in mind culturally we've worked hard to create a meritocracy populated with outstanding leaders, sharp real-estate minds and an organizational structure and platform that is built for continued success and industry leadership. That is why I can comfortably attest that DDR's best days lie ahead. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul to commence addressing what's really important and significant and that's the continued execution of our strategic plan that has led to another consistent and outstanding quarter.
Paul Freddo: Thank you, Dan. As reflected by our strong results, momentum continued into the third quarter resulting in 342 new deals and renewals for 2.7 million square feet. Our leased rate improved by 30 basis points sequentially to 95.6%, our highest leased rate in 26 quarters or since the first quarter of 2008. We achieved a positive pro rata new deal spread of 23.6%, a positive pro rata renewal spread of 8.2% and a combined spread of 11%. These spreads represent our highest spreads in 26 quarters. It's worth noting that this deal volume and these spreads were achieved with a level of CapEx that compares favorably with prior quarters. As you can see from our net effective rent disclosure, the total cost of new deals as a percentage of starting base rent declined to 15.5% below our historical average cost of 20%. We see no concerning trends in the cost of new deals or renewals and remain focused on controlling these capital expenditures. As the demand for prime power center space continues, these results demonstrate our ability to unlock organic growth opportunities while continuing to improve the merchandise mix and credit quality of cash flow even in the face of a high leased rate environment. As such, our Project Accelerate initiative continues to be a focus of our leasing team, as they drive value by further improving the tenant base, growth profile and credit quality of our assets through the recapturing of high demand box space and releasing those units to market share winning retailers paying today's higher market rents. Of the previously announced 26 boxes representing 710,000 square feet which we now control, I'm pleased to inform you that we've either signed or are finalizing 19 leases with another three at LOI. The average rental spread achieved to-date, are between 30% and 40% and we're achieving unlevered cash on cost returns from the low double-digits to the mid-teens. Recently, we secured control of another four locations representing 165,000 square feet. It is important to keep in mind that for many of these deals we have an ongoing option or right-to-recapture allowing us to control the timing and providing us with tremendous flexibility and limited downtime. While I offered a handful of examples during our second quarter call, I'd like to provide a couple of additional examples to highlight the continued success we're having with this initiative. First we recaptured 31,000 square feet at our shops at Midtown Miami, a 98% leased 645,000 square foot prime power center featuring the largest concentration of value-oriented retailers in the city of Miami. With an underperforming tenant occupying well positioned space within the center, we proactively recaptured the space in advance of its natural lease expiration. We are back filling the recaptured space with Nordstrom Rack, which will significantly improve the center’s overall merchandize mix, credit quality and traffic. With minimal downtime and CapEx, we dramatically improved Midtown Miami’s regional draw, NOI growth profile and NAV by proactively indentifying an opportunity and adding a premier tenant Nordstrom Rack which will open in the spring of 2015. Separately, we negotiated a recapture of a 28,000 square foot square-foot Barnes & Noble box at a 1.1 million square foot prime power center in Orlando which was acquired in 2013. We will be backfilling the Barnes box by splitting it into two units for Forever 21s new F21 Red concept, as well as a Carters and OshKosh combo store, improving the merchandise mix and credit quality of the overall center in addition to significantly beating our initial underwriting for this wholly-owned asset. This two examples are typical of the many project accelerate success stories that have enabled us to generate the double-digit returns previously mentioned. We recognize the unique current supply and demand environment and believe that it will not last forever and we remain focused on aggressively capitalizing on the opportunity at hand. During our last call, I mentioned that we are proceeding with select ground up development projects and continued to add fully stabilized prime power centers to our portfolio through this initiative. I would like to take a few moments to provide an update on development activity for the third quarter. For those following DDR on Twitter you may have noticed the grand opening of the Maxwell on October 6th. A 240,000 square foot urban multi-storey prime power center located in Chicago, South Loop, the Maxwell is anchored by Nordstrom Rack, T.J. Maxx, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Pier 1, and Burlington Coat Factory. The Maxwell boasts a trade area population of 744,000 people with average household incomes of $91,000 all tenants opened on-time and on-budget traffic and sales are strong and we are excited about the future growth prospects of this asset. Additionally, we officially broke ground on Guilford Commons in August, which will open in the back half of 2015. Located just east of New Haven Connecticut, Guilford Commons will stand 130,000 square feet and consists of three junior anchors including a specialty grocer and 40,000 square feet of shop and specialty space. Lastly, we are on-track to break ground in December on Lee Vista Promenade, which is a 450,000 square feet multi-phased development project in Orlando that will be anchored by a theater and offer a best-in-class line up of junior anchor tenants and restaurant operators. The first phase of this project will open in the fall of 2015. We are excited about our ability to successfully capitalize on current organic growth opportunities as demonstrated by our leasing results, despite a high leased rate of 95.6%. Initiatives such as Project Accelerate, the strategic monetization of our land bank and the ongoing redevelopment program remain key contributors to this success and will continue to be drivers of growth well into the future. And I will now turn the call over to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. Operating FFO was $106.2 million or $0.29 per share for the third quarter, including non-operating items FFO for the quarter was $110.8 million or $0.31 per share. Non-operating items primarily consisted of non-cash gains on sales. The third quarter marked another period of robust transactional activity on both the acquisition and disposition front. As this management team has articulated and executed on for the past five years upgrading the quality of DDR portfolio through active portfolio management as a top priority and was again on display. We closed on the acquisition of seven power centers from existing joint-venture with Blackstone for $377 million. The portfolio consists primarily of power centers with a grocery component located in Los Angeles, San Diego, Portland, Washing D.C., Cincinnati and Harrisburg and is representative of our continued ability the source high quality assets off-market that meets our investment criteria in terms of the NOI growth profile. Significant opportunity within the seven asset portfolio remains as the currently lease rate is 100 basis points below our company average for the majority the vacancy contains three junior anchor boxes in prime assets that we are in advance discussions to fill. Our relationship with our partners Blackstone remains very strong and the seamless execution and favorable outcome for both parties is evident in the execution of the buyout of our second joint-venture including the redemption of our $30 million of preferred equity. The transaction represents the culmination of BRE DDR Retail Holdings’ two joint venture and we are pleased with the progress thus far on the sale progress of 22 other properties that represent the entirety of two lower quality joint-ventures that we expect to close on by year-end. As we’ve mentioned at length, we remained focused on reducing the number of joint-inventers in an effort to simplify our structure and continue to upgrade the quality of our portfolio. The acquisition activity this quarter was primarily financed through asset sale proceeds, most notably from the disposition of a three asset portfolio in Salt Lake City for $223 million. Our decision at Salt Lake City with the result of our determination that the pricing environment yielded an attractive opportunity to exit a market deemed non-core by DDR. Also in the third quarter, we closed on the sale of our final land parcel in Russia for $90 million, further simplifying DDR story by completing the exit of all markets outside of North America. Year-to-date and inclusive of the recently announced closing of the 71 assets with Blackstone from ARCP, DDR has sold or is under contract to sell approximately $1.3 billion of assets while reinvesting in approximately $1.1 billion of acquisitions in preferred equity. The 2014 activity thus far positions us in line with our most recent transactional guidance, the forecasted DDR as a net seller of assets for the year although with much higher volume of activity than originally forecasted. I'd also like to address this quarter's debt-to-EBITDA calculation as well as our broader view on risk management. Third quarter debt-to-EBITDA was 7.3 times on a consolidated basis of 7.7 times on a pro rata basis, up from last year and our first increase in many years. While that statement alone is inconsistent with our message of leverage and risk reduction it is important to note that $377 million acquisition from Blackstone closed on September 30th adding the full debt load to our calculation but with no EBITDA contribution for the quarter. This is simply a timing issue that will be remedied in the fourth quarter calculation when the EBITDA shows up. More broadly, we continue to expect to reduce debt-to-EBITDA but our primary focus is on the Company's overall risk profile and so transactions such as this quarter's attractively priced acquisition of prime centers or last quarter's sale of Sonae Sierra Brazil can continue to be pursued for their contribution to risk reduction rather than the slight setback to a continued debt-to-EBITDA reduction. As we head in the fourth quarter we would like to take this time to update 2014 guidance by tightening the operating FFO range from a $1.14 to a $1.18 per share to $1.15 to $1.17 per share consistent with our normal practice we'll provide 2015 guidance at the beginning of January. Finally, we'd like to remind everyone of our property tour and dinner in Atlanta on Tuesday November 4th the day prior to NAREIT. Thank you to everyone who has RSVP'd thus far. At this point I'll stop and turn the call back to Dan for closing remarks.
Dan Hurwitz: Thanks David and before turning the call over to the operator I'd like to briefly reiterate the strength and consistency of our operating results for the third quarter. For the 22nd consecutive quarter we leased over 2 million square feet, resulting in a steady increase in our portfolio leased rate for each of those 22 quarters. And for the 10th consecutive quarter we generated same-store NOI growth of greater than 3%. Our leasing spreads this quarter were the highest we've seen since pre-recession and the current supply demand dynamic indicates a continued favorable operating environment for retail landlords with high quality power centers and a platform that is equipped to take advantage of the opportunities present in today's market. Our Project Accelerate initiative is generating exciting results, and we're optimistic about the prospects for continued growth and success of that program. At this point Mark, we'll begin to take -- we'll take questions from our callers, thank you. Question-and-Answer session
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please proceed. Craig Schmidt - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you, I just wanted to get possibly an update on The Pike and Paseo Colorado and possibly may be some understanding -- are there special people to lease what is a little bit different audience at those projects versus your power center lineups?
Paul Freddo: Yes Craig this is Paul. Let me answer the latter part first. We have our leasing team a couple of people devoted to these two projects entirely obviously they're massive projects unique in our portfolio, as well as consultants who are best-in-class and well-known in the business in the type of retailers we'll be looking to attract. As we've announced in The Pike we're going to formally rename it the Outlets at The Pike and it will be an outlet center so we're dealing with an outlet consultant which is very typical of the outlet business. We're making great progress in both projects in The Pike we've recently signed a Nike outlet and H&M and we've got some other big signings in the near future that we'll be announcing. We opened a restoration outlet, restoration hardware outlet last fall and have just signed an expansion of that unit, business is through the roof for those guys, so making great progress and we'll be keeping up everybody up-to-date with press releases and other disclosures on that one. Paseo same story we are making great progress we acquired the Macy department store building a couple of years ago which was a big first step they were underperforming holding back the project a great location, great asset in Downtown Pasadena and we're proceeding with a hotel deal and some other deals again can't announce all of them because we haven't signed tenants, but the progress is significant and again we've got people focused on those two projects exclusively.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed. Alex Goldfarb - Sandler O'Neill Just a question on fast fashion, obviously, a hot topic, if you will -- no pun intended, obviously, but a hot topic with the Primark/Sears deal. Do you think that we should -- the malls have certainly gotten a lot of attention out of this, especially because Sears seems to be getting the headlines, but should we expect more fast fashion, Primark's and those folks to show up at the power centers? It would seem if some of these retailers want large GLA footprints that the malls is a little tough in the sense that you need a productive mall but with a sort of underperforming anchor versus the power centers the drive huge amount of sales and would seem to have the optionality and the square footage that some of these guys want. So if you could just tell us what you guys are seeing?
Dan Hurwitz: Well I think it's pretty clear that the interest in power centers from fast fashion is there. One of the problems we have obviously is we've a very high occupancy rate just like the A-mall business has a very high occupancy rate, so the opportunities for fast fashion to penetrate either one of those has to be extraordinarily creative which is whether it be through Primark-Sears or whether it be through our Project Accelerate and things of that nature. I think overall you're going to see the growth of retail is going to go where there is opportunity and where there is availability, as we focus on the future of some of the boxes not just in our centers but in the mall business as well, I think the fast fashion retailers are going to have to be very nimble and they're going to have to adapt to whatever opportunities available to them if they're going to grow market share particularly since new product is not being built. So, as a practical matter we have conversations with these folks on a regular basis we've done deals, Paul just mentioned we just did the Forever 21 Red deal at The Pike and we will continue to pursue fast fashion retailers where opportunities present, but they're having to be much more nimble and much more agile than simply resting on the laurels of a prototype that they think is easily deliverable across the country because nothing is easily deliverable today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citi. Please proceed. Christy McElroy - Citigroup Dan thanks for your opening comments. We wish you well on your next step. And while we recognize that you're not running the process, what are you doing as the CEO to keep the organization and your people laser focused during this period of uncertainty. And what are your expectations for timing of a replacement announcement?
Dan Hurwitz: Thank you for your comments Christy, I can assure you that what I'm doing and what we're all doing is the same thing we've done for the last 15 years I've been here which is we come to work every day and we work hard and we run the company the way we think we ought to run it in order to meet the -- fulfill the obligations and the expectations of our investors and our employees. While there is uncertainty for sure in the market and there is a lot more chatter about it in the market than even there is here at corporate. People are coming to work they're working hard as you can see by the results in the quarter and the momentum the company has no one's taking time off and no one's certainly feeling sorry for themselves one way or the other, everyone's coming to work and working very hard. As CEO it's my job to make sure that everyone does that for as long as I'm here. In regard to the timing expectations that's very much up in the air, I'm very committed to making sure we've a smooth transition with the next leader of this company and that's something that's extraordinarily important I think and an obligation I had not just to our shareholders but to the employees of this company and I fulfilled that, so the timing of the search is unknown to me but I'm committed to running the company for as long as I'm in the seat and I'm also committed to helping with a smooth transition at the appropriate time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. Todd Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets Hi thanks good morning. Question in terms of acquisitions Dan, it sounds like there are a lot of consolidation opportunities out there and you said that they should be pursued aggressively, what's DDR's appetite today based on what you're seeing out in the market and with where pricing is and sort of the level of competition for higher quality product and then as we think about DDR's investments going forward should we expect to see more joint venture partnerships like the ARCP portfolio deal or more one-offs, what's the preference?
Dan Hurwitz: Well as a practical matter, you should assume that we'll be aggressive in pursuing a number of the opportunities that we've identified, but a number of those aren't for sale, people aren't selling the assets it's incredibly fragmented there is a lot of private owners these are not in the hands of institutions or even other public companies for that matter. And the competition can be stiff when there is a bid or an auction and very often particularly when we bid up against non-traded REITs we'll lose for obvious reasons but we're able to strength relationships with owners of assets that we have interest in, we're able to provide tax efficient transactions which some other folks cannot do obviously which the REIT structure enables us to do, we are a very viable and I think attractive buyer for those that are interested in selling. So our folks are very focused on it. Our acquisition team knows exactly which assets we're interested in and the markets that we want to do business in and we are reaching out to those for the owners of those assets on a regular basis. Pricing is tough and one of the reasons why we're going direct to these folks is because we're trying not to be in an auction process. An auction process does not serve this company well and I think our success and our hit rate will be very low if we get into an auction process given our cost of capital and our discipline compared to the cost of capital and others and their discipline. In regard to…
David Oakes: Final point about that is the ARCP transaction. I think that was the unique one, both in its size and the way it came about and so I think was one that we made sense to do in joint venture because of the nature of the portfolio, the size of the portfolio in the way that the deal came together. But I think in general for what Dan is talking about in terms of the detailed work we’re doing to figure out what we would want to target over the next many years. I think our general focus would be owning the majority of those on balance sheet in a fully owned fashion. In certain circumstances where we can get that level of involvement -- initially I think you’ve seen us work very well with Blackstone to step into 100% ownership of the highly attractive centers, even if it takes a multiyear process, in some circumstances and so I think the ultimate goal is wholly owned but selectively you will see use very carefully certain high quality joint venture partners.
Operator: Paul Morgan from MLV. Please proceed.
Paul Morgan: Hi good morning. You’ve talked in the past about how when people ask about the cap rate spread between your acquisitions and your dispositions that it might be narrower than because of land sales and on the acquisition side may be a preferred equity deals at higher yields. All of that's kind a happen in the past quarter. So maybe just have an update on, if you look back on the year to date, how do we think about the spread between the investment yield and the disposition cap rate and whether -- how we think about that going forward?
David Oakes: Sure I mean and it has been a significant change over the past few years from that extreme time during the downturn of selling pen cap assets and repaying the line of credit 1% or 2% percent in a massive spread there. Today we're at a very, very different point where we can execute on a continued portfolio improvement and a continued portfolio and capital recycling plan without about near term dilution. So we think it’s certainly the right long term decision, but the drawback at times -- the near term dilution associated with that today, with the quality of the assets we're selling, where it's no longer primarily non-prime asset, it’s prime assets that we either think have greater risk in some circumstances or lower growth in other circumstances. But we’re selling to a much more institutional crowd of buyers at a much more institutional sort of pricing. And so where the most significant change has happened is on the cap rates on our sales that have gotten significantly lower over the past few years and today we're consistently executing in the 7% or low 7% cap rate range for sales. And while the option market for acquisitions is not affording deals any more close to that pricing and I think our careful focus on off market acquisitions has gotten us to a point where we’ve been able to execute on very -- on the acquisition of very high quality centers, anywhere from the low sixes to the mid to high sevens in some cases, with a blended average probably in the mid-sixes, maybe 6.5% to 6.75%. And so I think with that you look at an extremely small spread between disposition cap rates of assets that we don’t want to own and acquisition cap rates that represent exactly where we want to put capital. You layer in a couple of land sales. We mentioned $9 million out of Russia, couple of other middle land sales and all of sudden you're at a point where you're fully funding your acquisition activity in a fashion that is completely neutral to near term earnings and we think very helpful to the long term growth rate of NOI for this portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Rich Moore: First of all Dan, we’re certainly going to miss you and good luck in your next phase, whenever that actually starts. You guys are picking up a lot of developments, a lot of acquisitions. At least you had mentioned on the last call dispositions would probably wind down by the end of next year and I’m curious, are you going to stall out here on the progress on the balance sheet as you have more investment opportunities and maybe fewer ways to fund those.
David Oakes: Absolutely not. There is a continued extreme focus on overall risk reduction at the company and that certainly includes further deleveraging. I think as noted in the comments that I made earlier regarding that specific that debt to EBITDA calculation, I think we certainly saw numbers that could indicate a stall out on that process for this quarter. But we need to think closing the nearly $400 million transaction at the very end of the quarter when its funded with dispositions earlier in the quarter and you put yourself in a position where at least a quarter point of debt-to-EBITA was shown higher than what's a normal run rate pro forma for a full quarter of that activity would have shown. And so I think we’re cognizant of the fact that the EBITA result for the quarter showed a stall out but I think that absolutely will be improved. In the fourth quarter and beyond, we continue to be a net seller of assets, which provides additional capital, even with development and redevelopment pipeline that continues to find several attractive projects a year and would not say that we're done with the disposition process. I think we are done with the disposition process for non-prime asset, but at this point either reset the bar or you just think about it more from a portfolio management standpoint of there's always going to be a bottom 5% to 10% in the portfolio and so I think there continues to be a new and an in fact higher quality pool of disposition candidates to fund all of our acquisition activity and other investment activity. And so I think we've positioned ourselves, we're very comfortable with funding our investment activity over the next couple of years, and in addition to that we continue to have one of the absolute lowest payout ratios in the sector and so the amount of free cash flow that we have access to on an annual basis is much more significant than peers to fund an additional portion of that activity or an additional amount of deleveraging on an annual basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Haendel St. Juste: So, we saw an article a few weeks back noting how Wal-Mart is shifting its incremental development spend, new stores away from big stores and will invest more in e-commerce as fewer shoppers head to their physical stores. A strategic shift, not too different than what Target, I believe, is doing. I'd love to hear thoughts about the future space demand implications for power center landlords like yourself. And do you think Wal-Mart and Target are early adopters of the format that other large box operators will eventually adopt as well?
Dan Hurwitz: Well I wouldn't start by saying that Wal-Mart and Target are stopping with any kind of growth plans in the bigger space. A couple of different stories there. One, Target has some things to figure out right, whether it's Canada and then their overall business and they are a creature of power centers, shopping centers and there haven't been a lot built as we've talked about for the past six years and they were driving that growth and hence they're not a part of what's being built today. Wal-Mart is still aggressively going after physical space, in terms of the neighborhood markets which they've upped the count and every time they talk about it, they increase demand of neighborhood markets they're looking to deliver as well as some of their convenience stores and more urban environment stores, which obviously you need to build smaller to get some of the urban markets. You also have to remember that both of these have large store counts in the super centers or the super Targets already. So where they're going to go with that new program is difficult and hence the move to a smaller format. The good news as we talk about everybody moving to more of an omni-channel approach is these guys have a lot of capital. Target is a great example of a company that's got a tremendous amount of capital to spend on that approach, since they're not building the 100, 120 new stores they were five or six years ago. All good for their business and all good for our shopping centers.
David Oakes: I think the other thing to add here and it's important to keep in mind is that as landlords, we benefit greatly by tenants taking less square footage. We talked about it many times on this call and we've encouraged many of our tenants to take less square footage, because sales per square foot inventory turn and profit per square foot all go up when you have less square footage and from a practical standpoint when we're dealing with tenants on new concepts, whether it be Kohl's with their 35,000 square foot concept or whether it'd be Wal-Mart with neighborhood market or the CityTarget concepts, it's all good news for bricks and mortar retail, because retailers are being smarter I think about how they use their square footage, what their production should be on a per square foot basis and that will lead to a healthier company altogether. There is nothing really worse than dead space in the store and we can through stores today and I'm sure we've all done that, where we see a lack of inventory, but we see inventory spread out in a way that's really unattractive to the consumer because it's just simply too much square footage. So we're encouraging our folks to take less square footage, primarily because we have lots of users for that square footage. So I don't think our shopping centers will get smaller even if our anchor tenants take less square footage, because we have more concepts coming into the power center universe than we would like to accommodate, which will lead to a much more diverse merchandise mix, which will help grow market share. So we're encouraged by the dialog about space. It's an important dialogue that should be had. E-commerce or not it's an important dialogue that retailers need to have on a regular basis and we think it's very positive that that dialogue is occurring.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Ki Bin Kim: So just a quick question on leasing. If I look at your end of 2013 supplemental heading into 2014, it seems like the small shop rent per square foot was close -- expiring, small shop rents per square foot was close to $28. And now if I look at your supp looking -- heading into 2015, your expiring rents are around $21.80 or so. And I know you just can't draw that line from point A to point B, but I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on how much -- what we can expect from lease spreads going into 2015 and is this delta -- how much of it is a mix issue versus a favorable vintage issue?
Dan Hurwitz: The biggest issue in the difference between '13 and today’s disclosure is simply the exclusion of Brazil in today’s numbers. I don’t know the exact impact but it’s significant and we certainly have not gone backwards on the base -- average base rents in any size. Our smallest size of less than 5000 is really average over $30 of foot and if you look at under 10,000, every category is growing when we continue to see it. Additionally, you have to look at a change in the asset but there're always going be sales and dispositions and acquisitions. So that going change it slight. But again I think the biggest thing to look at was Brazil came out. That drove that number down. But you will see that grow consistently on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Vincent Chao: Just wanted to go back to the sort of the investment environment to your comments about the strong demand from new concepts and some of the fast fashion. You've got a couple of new developments the pipeline here that I know you had talked about for a little while. Just curious what we should expect in '15. Can we see some additional starts coming on? It looks like Chicago you've got a fair amount of space. I know you've got the project there already, but it looks like that's close to being completed here.
David Oakes: Yes we, that’s quite a bit on our plate. Vince, as you know other than projects we just announced as completing or bringing to a close Seabrook; Marion, Kansas; The Maxwell and we're going commence a second phase of Bill Gate either next year or early '16 with month. We've got the ones we're kicking off in Connecticut and Florida, Guilford and Lee Vista. So that's quite a bit on our plate. All good news. Most of those -- other than Bill Gate and the Maxwell, these were on the site plan that we’ve been holding. For some time market conditions are right, tenant demand is right. So we’re proceeding with them. There's been a great level of activity, as I see it over the past two years and over the next year and a half, two years. We’ve been very consistent and disciplined with our approach on the new ground up development as Dan has stated many times. We’re not going to go out and control site by site that need to be entitled. They're going take several years to accomplish that process, accomplish the -- ascertaining the level of retailer interest. We get a lot of opportunities thrown at us every day and we look at them carefully but again very selective. So I think you can feel good about what we have in our immediate pipeline and that we will continue to serve other opportunities but it’s going to be the right ones and its going be where we can step in, use our leasing and development expertise and execute quickly.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from ISI Group. Please proceed. Steve Sakwa - ISI Group I guess I wanted to follow up on the question about just kind of releasing spreads. And Paul as you sort of look at into next year, I don’t know what percentage of your 2015 leasing would have been put to bed today, but just how do you feel about kind of where are market rents are versus the expiring rents and do you think that that number is similar or perhaps even higher in '15 versus '14?
Paul Freddo: Two different categories Steve, right. On the renewals, listen I'm with [indiscernible] 8.2% pro rata spread for this quarter. That's again the largest in 26 quarters. That won’t move a lot. If we keep that north of eight, get it approaching -- 10 has been the goal. That’s a great accomplishment. On a new deal spread I feel great. 23% in the quarter is a big number and there is no automatic that it just continue to grow from there but if we can achieve somewhere in that mid-teens to mid-twenties, obviously there's going to be out lies in terms of quarter by quarter performance, but I see no reason why we shouldn’t continue to see these outsized new deal spreads and renewal spreads in the high single digits. I know we pound this one every time we’ve talk, but that supply and demand dynamic is working well for us we continue through initiatives like the Project Accelerate to encourage and motivate our team to create vacancy, because that’s what we’re seeing. A lot of those deals in this quarter by the way that drove that 23% new deal spread were within the Project Accelerate initiatives.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please proceed.
Tayo Okusanya: Dan, I just wanted to add my own comments about how you will be missed. And I guess just going back to the whole change in management, the press release did come out, some of us have had the opportunity to have private conversations. But I guess for those investors that have not really had a chance yet to fully understand this or are struggling with it, Dan, could you just kind of let us know once and for all exactly why this was the right time for this decision to be made in regards to a management transition at DDR, and what that process involved to come up with a mutual decision?
Dan Hurwitz: Well I think as every big company we’ve been talking at DDR about succession planning for quite some time. That’s been no secret. It fits in the market and the board has done an excellent job in making sure that management is very focused on it and that’s why we built the team that we built. The conversations between the management team in general and the board have been consistent. We feel that Company is in terrific shape. I don’t think there is a time that in the past five years I feel better about this Company than I do right now. I feel better about our asset class. I feel better about our management team, better about our balance sheet. This is a time where this Company is not only built for the current environment but I think it is also built to take a punch, if the market turns a little bit. So we just felt that this was a stable company, that is an industry leader in a lot of areas and the time was right for us to move on to other opportunities. And the five year plan that we put together has been pretty well accomplished. If you really look at -- those of you who were at our 2009 Investor Day and you heard about what we talked about doing and if you look at what we’ve accomplished, we’ve pretty well done that. So -- we haven’t been successful with everything, don’t get me wrong, but we've accomplished a lot and I think it’s time for new leadership and both the Board and I agree that it’s time for new leadership to take this Company through the next five year strategic plan. So that was the conversation. It was a good conversation. I think the process is a professional one and I will be very supportive throughout.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Metz from UBS Securities. Please proceed sir.
Jeremy Metz: Can you just talk a little bit more about how the process works with the deals you just bought from Blackstone this quarter? Did you go to them or they come to you, and just what the spread was between the yield you guys bought in and where you think the market for those assets is today?
Dan Hurwitz: Sure. This was originally a portfolio that actually Blackstone had tied up a year and half ago or so. It was in a not ideally structured joint venture and Blackstone was able to tie up the portfolio in a very attractive price. It would have something that at time we would have been happy to buy the entirety of but to their great credit and deal sourcing ability Blackstone was the one that brought us this transaction and so we entered into it; initially in joint venture with them, both ran it and underwrote it, during that first year of ownership made good progress on leasing but only a year later I think Blackstone was very pleased what they’ve achieved, returns that they were interested in recognizing. We were in a position where because of the lumpy nature of the Brazil sale, the lumpy nature of the Salt Lake City sale, as well as a heck of a lot of other dispositions on top of that that we had lined up, that we did have both the capital and the interest in acquiring high quality assets. These are generally sort of assets, especially the majority of the portfolio would represent coastal assets, Portland, San Diego, LA, Washington DC. We bid on this stuff all the time and don’t even make it to the second around. And so we were pleased for a portfolio that we knew well and we were certainly paying a premium relative to what the joint venture had purchased that a year prior by about 75 basis points, going from about seven in a quarter to 6.5. So certainly acknowledging -- we’re well aware that we’re paying a premium to what the venture could paid only a year and change prior, but also thought that sort of mid six pricing on a NOI, that we knew very well is quite attractive for a portfolio of asset, where I think the great coastal stuff would price comfortably inside of that and even the Cincinnati and Harrisburg assets are very attractive. So I think Blackstone did incredibly well during their year of ownership, a year in change of ownership but I think the pricing in which we’re getting these assets positions us very strongly to get a good initial yield to redeploy capital from non-prime asset sales and to position ourselves in a very low risk way to generate strong NOI growth from these assets over the next many years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason White from Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
Jason White: I was just wondering on your call last quarter you talked about the yields for your two new developments in Orlando and New Haven. I want to say between 8% and 8.5% was the range. Can you give us an idea of what those yields would be if you include the land costs and potentially if there were impairments taken perhaps on the original land cost?
Dan Hurwitz: Let me start with -- they’re both north of 8% on an incremental cost, Jason and they'd be close to 6% on an all-in. I'll turn to David.
David Oakes: Yes, you got around 20 million for development in original land cost. That’s what gets left out of that incremental investment side of it. They were not impairments taken on these projects, just the typical quarterly process we go through to think about impairment analysis and for wholly owned developments, the hurdle of the undiscounted future cash flows for a project that we expect to own for a very long period of time did not either force or allow us to take impairments on that land. And so you’ve -- in our total base of what will online late next year, you do have that land cost but for purposes of us thinking about returns, the numbers that we’ve offered are on a incremental basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Michael Mueller: Hi. On the operating side, wondering what do you see as ceiling at this point for the leased and the occupied rates for the portfolio.
David Oakes: At some point Michael they should both get to -- it's a similar number but I would tell you that we talk internally about 96.5% but I would never put the ceiling down. As we continue to improve the quality of the assets themselves, we could move that North of that. So again we talk internally near term goal if you will of 96.5%, which puts us at historical heights for full occupancy, but I honestly believe we think get north of that just based on the transformation of the quality as we disposed off some of the non-prime and buy some prime and prime clubbed assets. One of the other things you have watch as we talk about a strong volume of deals, a lot of that's not going to even move the needle because we're talking about space that is currently leased and we may be signing a lease with a new replacement tenant to accelerate being a great example of that scenario. So we can continue to improve the quality of the tenant mix and the credit quality of the tenants, as well not even moving the needle on the occupancy rate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christ Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please proceed.
Christ Lucas: Just a follow up kind a question on comments made earlier related to encouraging tenants to take less space. I guess I’m wondering about specifically in either Kmart, Sears, or in Office Depot, whether you are seeing variability to sort of execute on a rational real estate program? Are you seeing that happening now? Has there been any change over the last six months or so and their ability to sort of move forward with that plan?
David Oakes: Not so much in a downsizing. Sears in a mall, story is a little bit different than us. I guess we talked about Primark example earlier but we’ve seen some closings of Kmart or [indiscernible] accelerate where it makes sense for those guys to leave the market or reduce their store base at any multi store market. Depot was obviously a big part of Project Accelerate to date and we think they will continue to be in that rationalization is going to happen in terms of store count, not necessarily in downsizing. We would encourage downsizings with all of the Office Supply Depot and Staples. And there's other examples used over several quarters worth of calls where we talked about Best Buy and others that we were very anxious to get space back, worked closely with them. That never really happened. We had a couple of small examples, but on a large scale we haven’t been able to get these guys to downsize. That’s going to change though. Overtime, now we have the merger complete between Depot and Max, they are clearly in the midst of figuring out exactly where they need to be how big they need to. So there will be continued opportunity. I would tell you that in that category I would expect that would get more back in their entirely, again all good news for us rather than downsizing in place. The other thing to keep in mind in regard to downsizings is it's really not a real estate decision. Even though we sit and assume and all we talk about is real estate but it’s a merchandizing decision and what happens is as people like Depot and others try to figure what it is they are going to be going forward, how they're going to merchandize their store, what product are they going to carry, how are they going to present it, et cetera, that all has to be done first. And once that's done, you can then back into a size that makes sense. But the big mistake retailers would be making and a lot have made over the past and people more sensitive to it now is sizing there store and then filling it. You don’t want to size a store and then fill it. You want to figure out what you want to fill it with first and then back in to the size. So as you see lot of this retailers who are struggling and working hard to figure out what their merchandize mix is going to be going forward, that will ultimately dictate the size of the store and obviously we will be here ready, willing and able to work with those retailers, once they’ve decided, who they're going to be, how are they going be relevant and how they're going merchandize there stores.
Operator: Your next question come from Andrew Rosivach from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Caitlin Burrows: This is Caitlin Burrows. I just have one quick question on the redevelopment at San Juan, Plaza del Sol. It looks like the spend was significantly reduced between the second quarter and third quarter. So I was just wondering what was the reason for this? Is there any sign of retailer reticence to go to the Island, or is it just some has been completed so there's less to go still?
David Oakes: It’s a pretty simple answer. We have decided to break those down to two distinct phases and phase 1, which we are completing right now is the number you see in the supplement. When we commence with phase II, which still is our plan, we’ll just show that as an additional redevelopment. In terms of interest, even with a softness and sales on the Island, what we’re seeing in least rate was flat for the quarter. Base rent was up for the quarter and the list we’re seeing of U.S based national retailers who are interested in the Island, Dan mentioned also in the script, on their Investor Day they announced that they are aggressively looking at the Island for a major portfolio of stores, which fits well into our transformation down there and redevelopments down there. But the simple answer again for the lower number is that we split into a distinct phase I and phase II redevelopment.
Dan Hurwitz: And as we’ve talked about before, the trouble, the significant challenge to create new supply on the Island is something that did cause us to think about the two pieces of the projects separately; the first one being internal redevelopment that we had control of, the second one being the true expansion where we are more dependent on an entitlement process. That I think is one that advancing well but it’s one of the themes we consistently talk to you about, about why retail continues to be so good on the Island. They may get really hard to build new projects and so for us we separated the two phases of this; one that was underway and completely under our control and one that represents the expansion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim form SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed.
Ki Bin Kim: Just a quick one. And I just got this question a few times over the past month. So I just want to relay that to you and sorry to put you on the spot, Paul Freddo. But I think people have a lot of questions regarding what maybe your personal plans are following Dan's departure. Does that have any incremental impact on your thinking about DDR or what you want to do just going forward?
Paul Freddo: No the Dan’s departure has no bearing on that whatsoever right now. I'm under contract till ’15 and these are discussions we’ll have.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call over to CEO, Dan Hurwitz for final remarks. Please proceed.
Dan Hurwitz: Once again I just want to thank each of you for joining us this morning and we look forward to seeing you at NAREIT.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."
27,SITC,4,2014,2015-02-12 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 DDR Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ketene and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s call Ms. Meghan Finneran, Financial Analyst. Please, proceed.
Meghan Finneran: Thanks. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO, David Oakes and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 as amended. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Lastly, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and CEO, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start off by addressing the announcement released yesterday morning indicating that I will become the next Chief Executive Officer of this firm. There are few constituents that I would like to address prior to discussing the fourth quarter results. First and I am pleased that the Board’s decision and appreciate their confidence in me and this management team and the shareholder value that we can create. I would also like to thank the investors and analysts on this call, who have chosen the team and extraordinary amount of support in the past few months. Next, I would also like to thank our outgoing CEO, Dan Hurwitz for his significant contributions in positioning this company where it is today. Finally, I would like to thank the employees of DDR. While the past months of uncertainty had not always been easy, the people in this organization remain loyal and have continued to perform like the top-notch professionals that they are. I look forward to working with them and taking this company to next level in the coming years. I would now like to address the quarterly and annual results. For the fourth quarter, operating FFO was $112.2 million, or $0.31 per share including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $80.9 million or $0.22 per share. Non-operating items primarily consisted of non-cash impairment charges on non-operating assets. For the full year, operating FFO was $420.4 million, or $1.16 per share representing a 5% increase over the prior year. And in the past four years, we have grown FFO per share to compound annual rate of over 6% despite selling over $2 billion of low-quality assets and significantly lowering leverage. In January, we released information on a number of announcements that I would like to briefly mention. First, we closed on the sale of 41 shopping centers and seven land parcels in the fourth quarter for $258 million of DDR share bringing the full year total to 82 operating asset sale and 16 land parcels for over $1.2 billion of disposition at our share. During 2014, we also closed on the acquisition of 83 shopping centers from $1.1 billion of DDR share. As we previously outlined, we felt that the frothy transactional market signaled that we should accelerate the disposition of non-prime and the low-prime assets that attracted pricing which led us to be a net seller for the first time in four years. Our funds management platform also made significant progress in the fourth quarter. Consistent with our plan to wind down smaller lower asset quality joint ventures and expand relationships with fewer partners on higher quality assets, we wound down two joint ventures totaling 23 properties during the quarter while closing the 70 property, $1.9 billion acquisition of the ARCP portfolio with Blackstone. While we have formed three joint ventures over the past four years of Blackstone, we have concurrently wound down 12 joint ventures. As outlined in our investor presentation, our portfolio transformation has been the most dramatic in the sector over the past five years and we are nearing the end of the low-quality asset bucket. As we closed the books on 2014, we now have only 32 fully-owned non-prime assets, most of which we are the marketing for sale or that we intend to sell over the next two years. The portfolio is in its best shape in its history. Although that certainly does not mean that the improvement is done, our top 112 wholly-owned assets as defined by future growth profile locations, sales and credit comprise approximately 75% of our gross asset value and based on the recent transactional comps, for similar assets generally in the 5% and 6.5% cap rate range, our portfolio quality and company net asset value becomes much clear. Additionally, we continue to maintain proprietary pipeline of nearly $1 billion of potential acquisitions in our latest Blackstone joint venture which bodes some of the top coastal power centers in the country. On the capital markets side, we issued $500 million of 10 year unsecured notes in January at a 3.625% coupon. The proceeds will be used to pay down our $300 million and $50 million unsecured term loans currently at a floating rate in the low 3% range while the remainder will be used in May to retire the $153 million of 5.5% unsecured notes coming due. With over $425 million of mortgage debt and $350 million of convertible debentures, mature during the second half of 2015 we intend to opportunistically access the unsecured bond market again this year and we’ll also consider restructuring our unsecured term loans at a rate more attractive than those currently outstanding and with a longer duration. I would also like to spend a brief moment discussing our 1.75% convertible notes maturing in November of this year. Our current 2015 guidance range includes the impact of approximately 6 million common unrestricted shares to be issued on November 20. It is our current intention to settle the principal of the notes in cash and any premium attributed to the conversion in shares by giving notice to the bond holders on October 6. For modeling purposes, the GAAP interest expense on the notes is 5.25% which would also be eliminated on November 20. However, prior to November 2015 of our stock price closed at a value greater than the 125% of the conversion price for 20 less 30 trading days in a quarter, holders of these notes may exercise their conversion rates in the subsequent quarter. The current price trigger to holder’s rights is $18.56 per share and adjust downwards as we pay our common dividend. Therefore, we are now assuming the full diluted impact of the shares for the last three quarters of this year. And the final modeling item I would like to address is on snowfall expenses in the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter of 2015. The November snow storm in Western New York caused a number of properties to incur abnormally large expenses relating to removing snow from the roofs of shopping centers, as roof top snow removal is not considered common area by anchor tenants, we assume the recovery percentage of approximately 25%, or roughly $1 million of snow removal expenses related to that storm all of which was incurred in the fourth quarter. We believe that in January that impact at the New England region will also impact the recoveries in the first quarter. However, we estimate the total expense to be approximately $500,000 with a similar recovery percentage. With that, I will turn it over to Paul for his remarks on operations in the retail environment.
Paul Freddo: Thank you, David. Before I begin, I would like to take a moment to congratulate David and to mention the enthusiasm with which this announcement has been made here at DDR. As most of you know, I was personally very supportive of David throughout this process and I know I speak for my team as well as the entire organization saying that we are thrilled with the Board’s decision and anxious to support David as he leads DDR in this next phase. The momentum we experienced during the first three quarters of 2014 continued throughout the fourth quarter and we are extremely proud of our team for the strong results delivered in the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we completed 327 new deals and renewals for 1.8 million square feet. Our leased rate improved by 10 basis sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year to 95.7%. This is our highest leased rate in 27 quarters or since the first quarter of 2008. For the fourth quarter, we achieved a positive pro-rata new deal spread of 25%, a positive pro-rata renewal spread of 7.2% and a combined pro-rata spread of 11.9%. Our new deal spread of 25% represents the highest spread in 10 quarters or since the second quarter of 2012. When combined, new deal and renewal volume for 2014 represents the highest volume in DDR’s history for the US and Puerto Rico showing the continued strength and quality of our portfolio. We are confident that we will build on our recent successes and deliver a leased rate increase of 25 to 50 basis points in 2015 consistent with our guidance. More importantly, we projecting same-store NOI growth of 2.5% to 3% despite the leased rate of nearly 96%. We have consistently reached or exceeded 3% same-store NOI growth for the last 11 consecutive quarters, which is a testament to the quality of our portfolio and the strength of our operational team. One additional metric I would like to share with you is our renewal volume. Total renewal volume reached a historic high in 2014 at 7.8 million square feet. The renewal success we continue to have is directly attributable to the quality of our portfolio combined with the continued landlord-friendly supply and demand dynamic we are operating within. We have mentioned on several calls that we fully expected renewal rates to stabilize in the mid to high-single-digits and this continues to play out. As discussed in our supplement, renewals require minimal to no CapEx and require no downtime resulting in enhanced portfolio economics without significant investments. During the quarter, we achieved a renewal retention rate of 90% above our historical average of 80% to 85% and we expect renewal spreads to remain in the high single-digit range for the foreseeable future. It is worth noting that 31% of our total leases by GLA will expire by the end of 2017 with 18% of those leases being naked, included in this number are 572 leases on space greater than 10,000 square feet with 75% of those leases being naked. These naked leases provide with us tremendous opportunities to capitalize on the current leasing environment by growing rent at attractive spreads and improving tenant mix. I can assure you that our leasing team is laser-focused on making the most of the opportunity in front of us and we will continue to execute effectively. As you are all aware, last week RadioShack filed for bankruptcy and Staples announced that it would acquire Office Depot. From our perspective, both announcements were anticipated and good news. With regards to RadioShack, the company accounts for only 113,000 square feet of space throughout our portfolio, proactively preparing for this inevitable bankruptcy filing long before it actually happened, has put us in a great position to backfill the space with quality retailers or to utilize the space to accommodate expansions for existing tenants within our centers. Our leasing team has done a fantastic job of pre-marketing RadioShack’s space and we have found there to be significant interest from a number of retailers. We look forward to releasing RadioShack’s space to market share winning retailers in addition to enhancing the credit profile of our portfolio. Moving on to the Staples and Office Depot merger, with 36 Staples locations and 57 Office Depot locations in our portfolio, we were analyzing the potential impact of this merger long before any announcement was made. I am sure you are familiar with our project accelerate initiative and Office Depot has been one of the high priority tenants that we have had significant dialogue with over the last year regarding lease terminations and the recapture of space. Both Office Depot and Staples occupied quality space within our prime shopping center portfolio and gaining control of these locations will not only allow us to positively comp existing rents and enhance the merchandize mix of our centers but we will also be in a position to collect termination fees for high demand space that we are anxious to get back. Similar to the initial merger between Office Depot and Office Max, this process will take some time to finalize and we again expect this merger if approved to have a positive impact on our portfolio, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The bottom-line is that market share-winning retailers like Nordstrom Rack CJ Max, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ross, Sprouts Ulta, and Five Below continue to grow aggressively. New supply of power centers remain constrained and we view these and similar situations as great opportunities to generate growth. And I’ll now turn the call back over David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Paul. I would like to conclude by walking you through our previously announced 2015 operating FFO guidance. The midpoint of the outline range of $1.20 to $1.25 per share represents a growth rate of 6%, above the pure average and inline with our average growth rate over the past four years. The OFFO range in conjunction with the recently announced 11% dividend increase to an annualized $0.69 per share should provide for a total shareholder return profile of between 7% and 11% at the current pricing. On the operational front, we are forecasting same-store NOI growth of 2.5% to 3%, a midpoint below we achieved in 2014 but reflective of the high quality portfolio of power centers that is approaching full occupancy of approximately 97% in the next 18 to 24 months. Growth components include approximately 125 basis points from rent bumps, 75 basis points from renewal spreads and 50 to 100 basis points positive net absorption from new leasing. Given the extremely favorable supply and demand dynamic in our sector and our dramatically improved portfolio quality, leasing spreads should continue in line or slightly above what DDR achieved in 2014. We also expect to bring online approximately $200 million of ground up development and redevelopment including approximately $100 million from legacy developments, notably in Gilford Connecticut, Orlando Florida and Seabrook New Hampshire just north of Boston. The vast majority of what would be placed in service will be in the fourth quarter at incremental yields in the mid to high single-digits. We also intend to bring online over 30 redevelopment projects totaling over $100 million with the majority coming from our full-scale redevelopment projects in Long Beach California and in the eastern sub-market of Columbus, Ohio. Redevelopment LOI will also be back half weighted with yields of approximately 10% on a stabilized basis. Finally, on the transaction front, we are coming off a very robust 2014 and intend to continue the dramatic portfolio optimization as we reach the final steps of eliminating non-prime assets. We are budgeting for a net neutral transaction activity to include the continued sale of non-prime line of assets at the mid 7% cap rate and a comparable amount of acquisitions at a total spread of approximately 100 basis points. While we currently have $159 million of dispositions closed or under contract, thus far in the first quarter, the acquisitions environment remains incredibly competitive and we will not compromise on our return or asset quality’s thresholds for purposes of FFO and to that end forecasted bulk of the acquisition activity will be back-end weighted. At this point, I will turn the call over to the operator and we will begin to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing Citi. Please proceed.
Christy McElroy: Thank you. David, can you comment on what if any changes you plan to make internally a CEO whether relating to strategy, operations, G&A, et cetera, and I am wondering if you’ve already begun the process of backfilling the CFO role and whether you are looking internally, externally or both?
David Oakes: Sure, the mandate is CFO is - or a CEO is a very recent one. So I think, I can say a few things, but not overly inclined to go into too greater detail at this very early point. One, I think what we’ve accomplished at DDR over the past several years has been very significant and has worked very well. I think the portfolio upgrade, the balance sheet upgrade, the management team changes and upgrades, have all been very significant and I think that that has positioned us well for everything that we can accomplish going forward. I’d obviously work closely with Dan on strategic matters for a number of years and certainly support very significantly the direction we’ve gone. So I think, for us, it’s how do we take the next several steps in that direction to get to blue chip status and I think there are steps on the portfolio side that continue to be out there, dramatically less dilutive than what we’ve done in the past. But I do think there is continued progress to be made both on the portfolio and the balance sheet. I do think we have the opportunity to execute an even higher level than what we’ve executed at to-date and so excited as the new team gets together with the formal mandates to best position this company as we look out over the next several quarters and much more importantly over the next several years. I also think we are much more focused on showing you what we can do than telling you what we can do. I am so excited to put that on display is, again, as we look out over the next few quarters, to years, as for the CFO we have been incredibly strong finance and accounting team here and no concerns about the depth of that bench somewhat it was timing-related issues with the Board’s formal decision on the CEO and trying to make sure we can get that out. But for earnings and somewhat just the importance of that mandate wanting to make sure that it got its own attention and so, we do expect to fill that role internally in the very near term and we will be in touch in the next several weeks regarding that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum representing UBS. Please proceed.
Ross Nussbaum: Hey David. Good morning and congratulations.
David Oakes: Thank you, Ross.
Ross Nussbaum: Let me see if I can tackle Christy’s question slightly differently. I think, during the CEO search process, it kind of felt like there were a lot of whispers coming either true or false from around the DDR circle that perhaps the Board was looking for someone who would consider a change in strategic direction and that your predecessor was unwilling to be open to such a significant potential strategic change. So, I guess the question is, just that, which is, in you are being named the CEO of the company, is this the Board saying that they want you to take the company into a more diverse place, like grocery anchored shopping centers, urban retail, or stick with what the game plan has been in the past few years?
David Oakes: I will say a couple things, obviously cannot completely speak on behalf of the Board, but have had a great opportunity to spend considerable time with them through this process discussing aspects of that question. And I don’t think, at least that I experience there was any formal push that there needed to be a strategic change. I think the Board’s focus was on finding the right person to lead this organization and trusting that that person in that team would execute well on the right strategies in a formal push for change. But I think, very prudently during the time of transition of Board that took the time to go through comprehensive searching and think about all of the options to best position shareholders for the near-term but even more so the long-term. So, I am really was in a party to the overwhelming majority of those discussions. I think I heard the same rumors that you did, but I think we are past that at this point. The current team has the mandate more excited about what we can execute on with the great base of assets we have today, but also with some continued improvement in that asset base as we look forward over the next few years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Auerbach representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
George Auerbach: Thanks, good morning. David, last year you sold the $1 billion of assets and probably 700 million plus if we exclude Brazil. I know, lot of the heavy lifting is done in that portfolio refocus but, just given compressing cap rates for shopping centers across the country, how likely do you think it is that we’ll see a sale much, much more than $250 million included in the guidance?
David Oakes: Yes, I think it’s probably the greatest risk in - within that range, not outside of that range, but within that range and our guidance is that the transaction market does continue to be quite strong making dispositions easier and acquisitions more challenging. The good news is that when you are getting better pricing on those dispositions, the good news is that with the worst part of the portfolio gone, it often times means we are selling better assets, institutional quality assets that are still at the lowest tier than our portfolio, but also generally larger assets. And so, instead of selling a lot of $5 million assets to get up to $250 million, you do have some larger ones in there. So, with a $160 million roughly under contract or closed six weeks into the year, I think it feels likely if today’s pricing environment continues that we would probably exceed that $250 million level knock at the expense of our FFO guidance range. But I think as one mid again to getting to the high-end or above that just when we think about the opportunity to accelerate this portfolio optimization in an environment that is strong. On the other side of that, last year, we had a few unique opportunities particularly the ARCP portfolio where we could redeploy capital in an off-market transaction where we thought pricing was attractive and so even though we dramatically accelerated the disposition volume in 2014, we also found a few unique opportunities on the acquisition side. I don’t know that we can find those again, but at this point last year, I had no clue that we could find them last year. So you should be sure that there is a team here working very aggressively on finding ways to redeploy that capital but obviously keeping our discipline very high in terms of return thresholds and our discipline very high in terms of asset quality.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samir Khanal representing Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Samir Khanal: David, good morning and congratulations for your promotion as well.
David Oakes: Thanks, Samir.
Samir Khanal: I look at your lease spreads in the quarter and it looks like they are approaching 12% and as we think about kind of the next 12 months, are these double-digit spread sustainable or do you think at some point that you have to moderate the kind of the high-digit - single-digits? I guess, a lot of it will probably depend on kind of the new leases, but as renewals cap out at some point, just trying to get a sense of what the blend of spread would be on a run rate basis here?
Paul Freddo: Hi, Samir, this is Paul. I think those spreads are sustainable certainly for the 12 months period you are talking about and probably beyond that, they want to go too far out, but changes that can happen in the macro obviously. But, you hit it on the head, the renewal rates are strong, are going to stay in that, I think, 7 to 9 range and then we should be able to sustain that on at the run rate going forward. You are going to see more balance if you will in the new deal rate, we had a very, very strong quarter obviously with the 25% pro rata spread on the new deals. But, there is still going to be - they are going to be out there, I would expect they are going to be in the mid-teens to the mid-20s. We are going to have some outlier deals that are very strong, that they are help prompt that and so that blended spread of low double-digits is achievable for the foreseeable future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt representing Bank of America. Please proceed.
Craig Schmidt: Thanks. First, David, congratulations.
David Oakes: Thank you, Craig.
Craig Schmidt: My question is, how should we think about DDR’s relationship with Blackstone given the Radar Hill partnership?
David Oakes: I think you should think of DDR’s relationship with Blackstone is a very close one, Dan, was absolutely an important part of that as evidenced by his new firm’s partnership with Blackstone. But there is an extraordinarily deep relationship with Blackstone particularly through Luke Partridge, our Head of Capital Markets, he is also been leading the efforts with our recent transactional activity with Blackstone. So, we’ve obviously worked very, very closely with Dan over the years, we’ve obviously worked very, very closely with Blackstone over the years and so we wouldn’t expect any change to the very close nature of our relationship with them. Even forgetting personalities for a second, both sides of this partnership have made a considerable amount of money in the two transactions that we’ve entered into - that have been monetized at least from a Blackstone perspective and we are very encouraged by the early returns from our third venture together. And so, I think more important than anything financially, this has worked extremely well, but beyond that, the organizations have worked well together and I would expect that that would continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Steve Sakwa representing Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks good morning.
David Oakes: Hi, Steve.
Steve Sakwa: Hi, I guess, to go back to the disposition acquisition and kind of where to put the money and given the comment that you are going to be approaching 97% occupancy, I’m just wondering where development plays a role here and I know that many of the larger boxes that historically drove the development are not as active today, but I am just wondering as you look at the landscape, can development play a more meaningful role over the next two to four years?
David Oakes: Steve, I’ll start with the overall - my overall view and talking for the entire sector. I don’t think it’s going to play a very meaningful role over the next several years and you hit the key point, to call, the Khol’s, the Target, the Lowe’s, these are the guys driving new power centers, strip center developments and they are not making deals right now. And in terms of our portfolio, that’s pretty exciting, we’ve got several underway. We are finishing up Seabrook as you know, and really just getting going on a project in Orlando and it Gilford Connecticut, land we’ve held for sometime, we’ll be starting a second phase down in Belgate, which was one of our new acquisitions done in Charlotte a year-and-a half, two years ago. So we are going to continue to be opportunistic. We look most of our development has been focused on the legacy land, best way to monetize the land as we look at it and - but we will keep our eyes and ears open as we were presented with of lot of opportunities all the time, obviously, they are very difficult to make work meaning new ground-up developments and we are not going to go out and find a land which is going to have a long entitlement process or a long lead time in terms of soliciting retailer interest. So, we’ll continue to do it on a limited scale, best way to monetize the land and in terms of this entire sector, I will see it being a significant factor for at least three to four years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Todd Thomas representing Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed.
Todd Thomas: Yes, hi, good morning. David, you talked about the balance sheet a bit. Leverage has ticked up over the last couple of quarters as you’ve continued to recycle capital and assets. I was just curious what the current thinking here in terms of lowering leverages from here. Do you feel that this is sort of a comfortable level for the company to operate at longer-term?
David Oakes: Yes. I’ll address it in a couple ways. To the last point, I absolutely believe that it is a comfortable level in terms of a very acceptable risk profile and appropriate place to be even if the world got dramatically worst. That said, our leverage will go down as we look out over the next several quarters, the next several years. I think we had outlined targets in the past, I am in complete agreements that the delveraging was slower, even took a pause in 2014 and you will not see that happen again this year. So, while I have no discomforts where we sit today you will see additional progress on that front. I can’t talk about this without broadening the topic to what we really focus on internally which is risk, leverage is one component of risk and there are many others. And so, when I think of 2014, if you ask me the question, did we significantly lower the risk of this company, I would say, absolutely, even though we did not significantly lowered the leverage of this company. And so, I think that the exit of Brazil, particularly as we look at an exchange rate that is 20%, 25% wide of where we sold that, even for a very good company down there, but one that did contain other risks for DDR as a US dollar-denominated owner of that as we have eliminated a number of joint ventures as we’ve significantly extended debt duration with our recent bond issuance. As we’ve eliminated a number of joint ventures as we have eliminated over 80 non-prime or prime minus assets last year. I have a long list of reasons I feel good that we significantly lowered risk last year, even if we didn’t lower leverage on a go forward basis, you will see us lower risk and lower leverage.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan representing MLV. Please proceed.
Paul Morgan: Hi. It’s been a while since you came out with your prime asset definition and, David, you alluded the prime minus in terms of sales from there. I mean, as you look at 2014, the experience in terms of the performance of the assets within the buckets that you created, how - are you seeing any shifts? Are there more centers that are becoming prime minus or non-prime that would kind of be better viewed as sale candidates now or maybe there are centers going the other way because of improvements in market conditions? But is the centers with demarcation that you came up with a couple of years ago, few years ago now, I mean, is it the way you see it today or would you raise or lower the bars if you think about 2015?
David Oakes: Yes. It’s a good question and it is something we focus on a lot because, honestly, I think the mindset has worked well, the performance of the assets has validated our ranking and what’s been the toughest part is the nomenclature. So we originally created prime and non-prime, we’ve then expanded prime to prime plus prime and prime minus in addition to non-prime. And so, we’ve created more grades as we refined our portfolio management process effectively, the re-underwriting in great detail and long-term budgeting of every asset we owned through a department we created about two years ago. And so I think while the nomenclature has gotten tougher, our focus on it has gotten even more significant our ability to quantify in terms of a zero to 100 score for every asset has gotten dramatically more detailed and more significant and more important in driving our transaction activity, both on a buy side seen how new assets fit in and on the sell-side identifying exactly what the sale candidates are for this year and next year. In the past, it might have been as simple as just same, here is the pool of clearly non-prime, non-institutional assets that we have no business owning. I think today it’s a much more quantifiable exercise and thoughtful exercise as we’d have to more clearly define what makes sense either because the higher risk profile or lower growth profile to not own them going forward. And so, we haven’t rolled out the complete details with the exception of this new property to us we’ll show off the complete details of that analysis every once in a while. But obviously, a proprietary analysis that we do internally that continues to raise the bar for average DDR quality, raise the bar also then for - from what we are selling. And so, that’s why we struggle at times the question about the portfolio transformation done, yes. As we define the portfolio transformation four to five years ago, when we first outlined some of these turns that is absolutely done, in fact, we’ve meaningfully exceeded what we’ve planned. Are we done optimizing and improving this portfolio? Absolutely not and so I think you’ll continue to see activity there driven by this quantifiable portfolio management exercise that continues to identify the lowest tier assets in terms of our ranking system for disposition over the coming year and so that process will continue and intensify.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander David Goldfarb representing Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning and congratulations David.
David Oakes: Thank you, Alex.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just, a question on FFO, it’s come up on a few of the different conference calls this quarter. If you look at what the company has achieved in the past, since the downturn, huge strides that continue to sort of operating FFO sort of harkens back to the dark days when there was a lot of stuff going on the numbers. For the most part, you guys have cleaned up, the FFO has very little. These days, I mean, obviously, this quarter had one major item, but for the most part, the numbers have gotten substantially cleaner. So, do you think that DDR will start to just use the NAREIT definition and lead with that, guide with that and obviously point out the one-timers. But get back towards the NAREIT definition as a way of demonstrating the transition that the company has completed?
David Oakes: Yes, I think, number one, we have made massive strides in transparency over the past five years or so, and you’ll only see that continues as we go forward. The way we look at it is the small number of adjustments we make to get from NAREIT to defined FFO to operating FFO are justified by the fact that we truly believe that is the better way to understand the company, its earnings power and its growth over time. That said, we disclose NAREIT defined FFO, we talk about it, we think about it. There is clear reconciliation from EPS to NAREIT defined FFO and then from that FFO to operating FFO per share. And so, we leave to the analyst community and the investor community to pick what’s most useful for them. Definitely understand your points about not wanting companies manipulating numbers, wanting things apples-to-apples as often as possible. And so, I think we want the disclosure out there for that. But we do end up with one-off situation, whether it’s Dan separation payment that was expensed or whether it’s the write-down on a piece of Toronto lands because Target pulled their multi-billion dollar Canada program off the table. I do think those are unique one-time items that at minimum we will highlight and people can use NAREIT defined FFO or operating FFO and we are going to try to make it as clear as possible, how to get between the two and basically the way that we think is most useful to look at the company in terms of an appropriate number to ascribe a multiple to or associated growth rate with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim representing SunTrust. Please proceed.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Congrats David.
David Oakes: Thanks Ki Bin,
Ki Bin Kim: You are welcome. And so, I think you bring out little bit of a unique perspective, you’ve been in the buy-side, you’ve been in the CFO role, now in the CEO role. How do you internally think about balancing - I know, someone - and Steve touched on it, but balancing financial leverage versus NAV per share or FFO per share and I know you alluded to lowering leverage over time, but, should we expect that to come from asset repositioning, recycling, or is equity more in the table now than it has been in the past?
David Oakes: We think about all those concepts a lot, probably FFO per share, least of those I said, we absolutely understand the importance of growing that metric. Over time, probably not on a quarterly basis, but on a much longer term basis, the question is constantly asked how do we best position this company to grow FFO per share over a very long period of time and certainly how do we grow NAV per share on a regular basis. You mentioned aspects of my background, I think the most interesting part of it, that, me and a lot of other people here live through one of the most significant blow-ups in this industry in terms of what we live through in the late 2008 and early 2009. And that’s I think is what has impacted us the most, those scars are deep, those are not forgotten. And so, we will never lose sight of the risk profile of this company even if another financial crisis of that magnitude is extraordinarily unlikely, we will never lose sight of that. And so, I think that’s what continues to drive the significant focus on risk management here. I went through a lot of the ways that we significantly lowered risk last year. The one that’s obviously somewhat missing is leverage reduction and defining and debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. I still think you are more likely to see leverage reduction through EBITDA increases and simple debt reduction. I don’t think there is a massively different view towards capital raising, equity is a portion of that. We’ve used it over the past several years, many times. But we’ve obviously been sensitive to the price that hasn’t been equity issuance - any price by any means and so I think it’s constantly something that we’ll be evaluated as part of that plan. I’d also remind you, we have - because of our relatively low dividend payout ratio, more free cash flow per share than any of our competitors which we certainly think of is equity that is created every year. We obviously address the issue earlier of having more concern about dispositions being higher than acquisitions. And so I think we’ll not equity that is additional capital that comes in available for leverage reduction or any other purposes. And so, we continue to believe that there are considerable ways that we can lower leverage either by debt reduction or by EBITDA increase and equity issuance is one of those levers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Sullivan representing Cowen Group. Please proceed.
James Sullivan: Good morning. Thank you. Maybe, just to take another stab at the issue of external growth outside of acquisitions, I mean, Steve asked a question about this earlier and Ross implied a question I guess about grocery anchored centers. But, given that, power center ground-up power center development is not going to - you don’t expect it to be likely for another couple of years and I am assuming it’s not likely because potential anchor tenants are not willing the pay the rents that are required to generate an acceptable return. When you think about the external growth alternatives other than acquisitions, that leaves you with redevelopments, and you have some of those and potentially you are going to expand that menu. But, one of the possibilities of course is doing smaller infill centers or grocery anchored centers, some of your peers are ramping up that development pipeline. So, I am just curious what your appetite is to increase the redevelopment pipeline as a percentage of the total external spend as well as possibly doing some grocery anchored products?
Paul Freddo: Yes, lot of questions in it, Jim. First, on the development side, I don’t know that it’s so much - when I talk about some of the larger anchors, the discounters department stores, it’s not a function of not willing to pay the rents to make ground-up development, they are not doing deals. I mean, Target is going to fix their business domestically. That’s very clear. They are going to do a handful of deals, majority of those been express or urban and not going to be - not some fields we are going to play in and what they fit into one of our centers. I’ll touch on the grocery anchored concept and then David could follow-up. It’s just not something. We worked our way out of a lot of the grocery anchored centers heavily reliant on small shops base. We’ve talked about the shops base in the power center sector of our portfolio. It’s a much higher quality shop space. We still have some clean up to do through lease up and through dispositions. But it’s not an area right now, but we are thinking - but not that we’d rule anything up, but not thinking about jumping into that business as we are seeing vacancy doing a pretty big way. Redevelopment is clearly a focus that continues to be a robust program. We spent over $125 million last year and brought about the same number of different projects obviously, because they are not just calendar year projects, but brought about the same amount into service throughout the year. In 2015, we are going to spend somewhere $100 million and $115 million, hopefully bring in between that in developments about $200 million as David mentioned in his script. That is a program we are continuing to rollout. We view every asset within the portfolio regularly in terms of what opportunities are out there that we haven’t identified yet. And there is still a big pipeline in that redevelopment. You have to see that going on for the next several years where we can spend and bring in somewhere between $100 million and $115 million a year at those much more risk adverse returns north of 10. It’s definitely a different type of project than development comes with a lot of that risk. The only asset you know what’s going on, easier to entitle et cetera. So, that will be the focus as far as going forward.
David Oakes: Yes, Jim, the exact question you ask is one that we ask internally and Paul and I discuss quite a bit of where should we be allocating capital within these projects and I think exactly as Paul outlined clearly today, redevelopment is the focus and we are not seeing many opportunities elsewhere. Lines are blurring and so, you are seeing many, many more of our projects including our new development in Gilford Connecticut that is grocery anchored, but still much more of a power center sort of focus in terms of when you look at whom we are going to place the side the fresh market that’s going there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Vincent Chao: Hi good morning everyone. David, just want to go back to your comments about the share gains vision and generally being agreement in line obviously that’s been very successful for you guys over the years. Just curious if you could comment on some areas or that maybe you didn’t agree with Dan as closely?
David Oakes: I mean, look, Dan and I work very closely, especially for the last five years, but really for the entire eight years that I’ve been here and so I think aspects of this strategy are both his and mine and Paul’s and a broader group of the industry, the experts that we solicited to make sure that we were on the right page. And so, I don’t think there are any massive differences in opinion that in terms of strategic direction that we disagreed on in terms of anything major and so. I am excited to have the formal mandate to run the organization and excited to show you exactly how well we think we can execute on most of the strategy you’ve seen and some additional items over the next, hopefully many years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carol Campbell representing Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed.
Carol Campbell: Congratulations David.
David Oakes: Thank you very much.
Carol Campbell: Can you go over the details of the convertible notes that you talked about earlier. Just exactly what’s included in guidance?
David Oakes: Yes, absolutely. This is for - originally issuance what we thought on, that is obviously a convertible security more complicated than straight equity or straight debt. I do think we’ve realized from a final conversion process and from an accounting process is actually more complicated than even we had bargained for particularly when the security is in the money. So, at this point, it’s a $350 million principal security with a conversion feature. The cash interest rate that we pay is 1.75%, the GAAP interest rate at which we expense the interest is closer to 5.25%. So we have considerable, effectively phantom interest that is currently being expensed and will be expensed until we call this note for redemption in the fourth quarter of this year. The other thing - and so the good news about that refinance is $350 million of principal is that right now - and I certainly think likely by the end of the year, we should be able to refinance that $350 million of principal at a rate comfortably inside that 5.25% rate that is expensed in our earnings. The aspect of the security that has not historically shown up in results has been the dilutive nature of the conversion feature. At this point, the notes are in the money to the tune of about 6 million shares that would be issued as part of our calling of these notes in the fourth quarter and so, we will start to reflect the dilutive nature of those securities for the second - excuse me - for the third - for the final three quarters of this year, those will be reflected in our diluted share count. So we’ll still be expensing the higher interest expense as well as the additional shares, even though they are not yet outstanding. And so, there is a negative impact to our 2015 results due to this security even if it doesn’t in fact convert and get refinanced until the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya representing Jefferies. Please proceed.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes, good morning. David, let me also add my congratulations as well, very well deserved.
David Oakes: Thank you.
Tayo Okusanya: In regards to the asset sales this quarter, I mean, could you just give us a sense again, the cap rates on those transactions and a general sense of the quality of those assets? Just as we kind of try to understand what’s left in regards to lower quality assets that would still be on the block for sale?
David Oakes: Yes, we went through a little bit of the detail in the call getting down to only 32 wholly-owned non-prime assets remaining. So, I think you can see how much that pie is shrinking relative to 300 plus of those 400 plus of those only a few years ago when we think about the transaction activity in the fourth quarter, it was on a wholly-owned basis spread across the country. Generally, small to mid-sized assets looking at a range of probably $5 million up to as high as $40 million to build up to that $600 million gross amount which is $258 million at DDR’s share. We also had two portfolio sales that went to liquidation of two of our joint ventures for $150 million and $170 million and so all of that aggregated up into that $600 million of total sales volume at a mid to high 7% cap rate range. I think the sort of product that we are looking to sell in 2015 is not higher than that and you are looking at a pricing environment that seems to only be getting stronger and so we would expect that cap rate range for 2015 sales to be somewhat lower and so we are encouraged by the activity that we continue to have on the deposition front. You are absolutely right to know there is less and less non-prime product out there. But then, the definition just becomes what’s still the lowest 5% to 10% on the quality perspective - on the quality spectrum in this portfolio and that’s what the focus is for 2015 sales. And so you’ll continue to see us active probably in the mid 7 cap rate range for the year and selling assets in - again probably hand $30 million range with a few of them might be a little larger than that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey there. Congratulations from me as well.
David Oakes: Thank you.
Haendel St. Juste: So one quick clarification before I ask my question. Just wanted to go back to an earlier question. It sounded - I just wanted to make sure that the current guidance does not contemplate incremental CFO or CIO costs?
David Oakes: The current guidance includes the company that we were sort of mandated to have looking back a couple months ago when we first came out of that, where there with the expectation that we would have me and we would have a CEO, some notionally, Dan’s run rate sort of compensation. Today, we are not adding that additional CEO and so, I think that does create some G&A benefits for us even with some compensation changes for internal people moving into the CEO and CFO roles.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, got that. And my question is on your overall small-shop occupancy, in aggregate you guys are at 92.5% now up from 91.3% last quarter. Have you maxed out the opportunity there? And then, if you could also comment on demand for the space that is sub 5,000 square feet where the occupancy is 86.5%, how would you assess the demand for that kind of - for that size space? Where do you think you could take that segment of your portfolio occupancy up to and then any incremental capital that might be required to do so?
David Oakes: Yes, Haendel, the 92.5% you quoted is really on that 5000 to 10,000 feet and as you mentioned the less than 5,000 is 86.5%, opportunities in both. So, the combined for everything under 10 which is - I know it’s a - the way a lot of our peers quoted is that 88.7% and then we’ve talked in the past and since believe we can get that combined everything under 10. So the 0% to 5 and the 5 to 10 to 92%. So we’ve got a better bit of 300 plus basis points. Demand is good, right and we are doing it in a lot of ways. And so we are consolidating shops base, we’ve seen several deals where we have combined two or three or four of these units for an Ulta or a Five Below or a PetSmart. And that's something we’ll continue to do as we get away from the smallest of shop space. The biggest percentage of - the zero to 5000 is going to be in some of the grocery anchored stuff - some of the stuff that you are going to see on disposition less. But again, the demand is good. We are seeing - we are not as mom and pop-centric. I think that some of our peers, again based on the character of our centers and we are going to see more franchisees, more of the service providers have seen a lot of food demand, but we still got room to run. Again, as we try to get that zero to 10,000 up to a combined 92% which is at 88.7%. If you are looking at comparative supplements too, you got to remember that in, at year 2013, we’ve had some - we had Brazil in that number. So, I feel pretty good about what we did over the course of the year. We were up 80 basis points jut on the quarter. The stuff doesn’t show - it’s shows at 10 basis points down year-over-year but that included Brazil in the year end 2013 number. So the progress is good. The demand is good. You’ll see us reduce the overall percentage of our GLA devoted to that smaller size, but you’ll see us get down leased rate up over 90% over the next couple of years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason White representing Green Street Advisors. Please proceed.
Jason White: Just wondering as you look back over the last two, three, four years of acquisitions and how they performed relative to your underwriting. Is there anything that you plan on tweaking in your underwriting process to, maybe target assets that you might feel are going to perform better than perhaps your underwriting would have suggested?
Paul Freddo: Yes, I mean, it’s been a major focus for us, especially after through the crisis completely taken a few years off and barely even reviewing acquisition opportunities because the capital wasn’t there for us and so as we get back into that business, probably four years ago as we started to outline the power center pieces, it’s probably three years ago as a mis-priced asset we have been very active on that front. We’ve done the few large portfolio deals, mostly from joint ventures. So assets we knew well, so I’d sort of exclude that from this analysis and outside of that it’s on the ARCP deal and a lot of one-off transactions. I would say, in general, the assets have performed better than our underwriting. There is going to be two reasons behind that, one, plugging them into our platform, we always find a few additional opportunities, two, the overall macro environment has continued to get better, which I think is important and three, maybe most important and most controllably, I do think we’ve taken cautious view to underwriting is why we lose the overwhelming majority of assets that we bid on because we are cautious in our underwriting. And you know often and you know the way that we think about retailers that doesn’t mean that we think every - supply stores going away and you underwrite that space as zero, but it does mean that we take a cautious view on underwriting and we are not filling everything up completely in the next few months and I think we got reasonable lead time capital cost everything else that go into that. And so, I think for those various reasons, we’ve generally seen acquisitions outperform our expectations, given the volume that have been joint venture acquisitions, I think there it’s a simpler case where we already knew them. But even on the third-party deals, we’ve generally seen them exceed our expectations. Going forward, our acquisitions focus I think becomes even more intensive as we look to the quality of land, in terms of defining overall locational quality. So retailers very important market overall, very important but specific sub-market and specific dirt that we are sitting on I think is something that it times looking at the long history of DDR, we hadn’t been as focused on as we should have and as we look forward, I think that becomes even more important for us. Certainly, it doesn’t mean that we will be competing with the overwhelming majority of capital in the world that exclusively looks at five or six coastal markets for acquisitions. I do think there are lot more places that we can make money and that our tenants can make money than simply those five or six markets, they will be a place that we certainly look for opportunities. But if we think returns are better and market and dirt quality is extremely good, you can certainly see us look at a broader list of top 40 or 50 MSAs not just top five or top six. And so, I think we’ll just continue to refine that focus more going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas representing Capital One Securities. Please proceed.
Chris Lucas: Good morning. Just a quick question on the - David, you had mentioned before a little bit about the blurring of concepts as grocery starts to get into the larger format centers. I guess, I was curious as to what your thoughts are as to any cap rate differential for large format centers that have or - and then those that don't have a grocery component, and if you could quantify that cap rate differential?
David Oakes: Yes, I think it’s a good question. It’s certainly case-by-case basis, but I think overall, we’d say there is at least 25 basis point benefit to adding a grocer to a power center whether that’s a traditional grocer, whether that’s the addition of considerable food, that’s driving traffic to a Walmart or Target or Costco or whether it’s the actual addition of a box like a Sprouts or Fresh Market into an existing power center. I think you are seeing an immediate sort of 25 basis point, maybe even a little larger than that, maybe 50 basis points benefit to the cap rate. And so I think an important focus for us is making sure we do have that grocery component as part of the merchandize mix, but also very important as we think of terminal value of a center.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly representing Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. David, you had a few questions on external growth, I actually have a question on internal growth. At DDR's Investor Day back in 2013, I think you guys had given a five year same-store NOI outlook of like 2.5% to 3.5% growth rate. Since that time I think you’ve paced around 3%, looking forward, I think you guys are guiding that 2.5% to 3% towards the lower end of that outlook and I would have thought that growth would have been more front-end loaded. Is that a function of industry conditions or timing or just knowing what you know now would you maybe have guided to a slightly lower range than you guys did back then?
David Oakes: I certainly don’t think anything has gotten worse in the environment. I absolutely don’t think anything has gotten worse within the portfolio. And so, honestly, I would continue to be very supportive of thinking about that 2.5% to 3.5% range that we articulated a few years ago and so we executed on some of that, probably a little better than the midpoint of that range and think that we should be able to be around the midpoint as we look out over the next few years. Obviously, we’ll try to push hard to exceed that, but obviously we’d rather show you that over the coming quarters and years and tell you about it.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Christy McElroy representing Citi. Please proceed.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, David, it's Michael Bilerman. I personally think it was your time on the sell-side that was the most important and defining of your career, so.
David Oakes: Absolutely.
Michael Bilerman: I did have a question on G&A and I know you talked a little bit about sort of backfilling the CEO and CFO roles internally and maybe there is a slight positive there relative to existing comp ranges that are in G&A. But, maybe, just more broadly, I think there has been some discussion or scuttle around the marketplace that at north of $80 million, that DDR's G&A levels were too high or have been too high. And I guess, as both in the prior CFO role and then the CEO role, do you agree with that or not and is there a material level that you could see in terms of savings if you are going to manage the company either the same or differently than it was being run before?
David Oakes: Yes, I think, if you look at it from pure ratio standpoint for the handful of folks that either run the whole universe or some subset as G&A as a percentage of revenue, as a percentage of market cap, I think, we generally screen very well in terms of a reasonable compensation structure, especially for a company that’s performed relatively well. And so, I don’t think there is a problem where anyone is banging on the door saying you have to run this more efficiently, but I do think with any transition and this has obviously been a significant one. There is an opportunity to evaluate the organization structure, the G&A load and so we are absolutely embarking on that and hope that we will be able to find some opportunities to run more efficiently. I think there are two aspects to that, I mean, there is the one side of that, that’s the simple G&A savings that we can hopefully generate, I mean, some of it very obvious by not replacing Dan. So, I think that’s clear and hopefully, we can locate some other savings. And I think overall, the greater focus is just how can we run the company as efficiently as possible, constant recognition that we work for shareholders, their capital that we are spending on anything and it’s their returns that that were tasked to generate. So, again, very early to answer this question. I mean, we’ve lived inside of here and we got some views on it. But - and I think we see some opportunity, but it will take us sometime to figure out exactly what that opportunity is. And again, it’s not the penny-wise pound-foolish thoughts, it’s how do we most efficiently operate this company for shareholders and so, your question is a good one and then it is a very reasonable to assume that that is a considerable focus now that this team has demanded.
Operator: With no further questions at this time, I would now like to turn the call back to President and CEO, David Oakes. Please proceed.
David Oakes: Thank you all very much for your time and for your support of this team through this process and we look forward to many, many more of these. Thank you. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day."
28,SITC,1,2015,2015-04-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day and welcome to the DDR Corp First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, you will hear from President and CEO, David Oakes; CFO and Treasurer, Luke Petherbridge; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today maybe forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ maybe found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 as amended. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I would like to start off by discussing the focus of this management team, the progress made in the first quarter, and the implications that this refined focus had on operating results for the quarter. As we have conveyed the investment community over the past two months, we are acutely focused on long-term net asset value creation for our shareholders and we are committed to building a portfolio of Fortress power centers, which combined with a low risk balance sheet and more simplified story and a talented team that we are refining should translate into outperformance in both full and bear markets. We have made good progress on those fronts in recent months that you will hear about throughout this call. First, we are accelerating disposition of our non-prime and prime minus assets beyond our original guidance of $250 million given the current pricing environment. While these buckets continue to diminish in terms of overall value, we think it is prudent to expedite the sale of these assets at historically strong prices for our property type as evidenced by large portfolio trade that was recently announced in our sector. Very simply, we only seek to own assets, which sit on high-quality dirt with attractive growth profiles. And those shopping centers that do not meet these criteria will be disposed of. That increased focus on the quality of the dirt and our strict underwriting standards have made the acquisition environment difficult, although we remain confident in our ability to source unique high-quality acquisitions at attractive prices. Longer term, we envisioned that the overall asset count of the company will continue to decline although we would expect our total portfolio value to be higher as we find larger scale acquisitions in redevelopment and wish to invest in the coming years. Second, we are reducing risk and creating more simplified company and remain paramount to our story. Our progress continued this quarter with the issuance of additional long-term unsecured debt and restructuring of our lines of credit in term loan. All of which extended our weighted average duration and reduced DDR’s cost of capital on which Luke will elaborate. Also during the quarter, we wound down the Coventry joint venture, which removed the overhang of legacy $500 million lawsuit and allowed DDR to effectively dispose of 22 low-quality joint venture assets and gain 100% ownership of a high-quality center in Southern California. Third, our organization continues to improve and heighten its focus on excellence and execution, long-term planning, operational efficiency and collaboration. These characteristics drove some of the activity that you saw in the first quarter and should have a much greater impact over time driving consistent long-term value creation even at the expense of some short-term noise. We are confident that our shareholders will see the fruits of these changes in the coming quarters. Finally, I would like to spend a moment on a specific example how this long-term focus can create short-term noise. Our decision to reduce our expected holding period on 25 operating shopping centers and the majority of our remaining land parcels that drove the requirement for the impairment charge as a result of our desire to more quickly reduce our exposure to weaker assets, while we acknowledge the historic investment missteps, the current team is committed to rapidly moving forward in an effort to create that fortress power center portfolio and report a cleaner earnings figure in future quarters. Additionally, our commentary regarding increased asset sales could indicate near-term earnings headwinds. However, our team believes that this is outweighed by the long-term benefit to shareholders as evidenced by the outperformance over time of those the blue-chip REITs who are similarly focused on capital allocation over the course of multiple cycles. I will now turn the call over Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks David. Operating fundamentals remain strong in the first quarter as evidenced by the continued strength in deal volume and spreads. We executed 289 new deals and renewals for 2.6 million square feet, in line with historic volume and resulting in a leased rate increase of 40 basis points year-over-year. For the quarter, we achieved a positive pro-rata new deal spread of 26.9%. Our highest pro-rata spread since we began tracking this metric. We also achieved a positive pro-rata renewal spread of 6.7%, resulting in a combined pro-rata spread of 9.7%. In regard to the renewal volume and spread, as you know these metrics will vary quarter-to-quarter based on the pool of leases that are being renewed in any given quarter. As an example in this first quarter, we had several large anchor tenants exercising options at lower single-digit spreads. If these anchoring renewals were excluded, our renewal spread would increase by 120 basis points to 7.9% on a pro-rata basis. Also worth noting 95% of all tenants with the opportunity to exercise an option did so in this quarter, well above the typical rate. This retention is a direct result of the improvements in the portfolio and the lack of downtime and capital required more than offsets the lower spread on an economic basis. Our overall leased rate declined by 20 basis points sequentially and increase by 40 basis points year-over-year to 95.5%. As I have previously mentioned a slight decline in the first quarter was the historical norm. In addition to the typical seasonality of move-ins to move-outs, this quarter’s decline also reflects the impact of the RadioShack bankruptcy and Project Accelerate as we continue to position our assets for long-term growth. The RadioShack bankruptcy alone accounted for 40 basis points of the 50 basis point decline in the leased rate per space less than 5,000 square feet. Given our pipeline of new deals, we remain confident in our guidance to increase leased rate by 25 basis points to 50 basis points by year end 2015. It is also important to remember that we view the bankruptcy of retailers such as RadioShack or Deb Shops in a very positive way. We have been anticipating getting this space back for some time and are excited about – by the opportunities these situations offer given the current leasing environment. First and foremost, gaining control of the quality small shop space that tenants like RadioShack occupies within our shopping centers allows us to re-merchandise our space and accommodate higher quality and better credit tenants. In many cases the simple backfilling of space results in an attractive rent comp ranging from the high single-digits to the mid-40% range. In other cases we are working with new or existing tenants to consolidate small shop space allowing tenants to get right sized or creating an opportunity to add a desirable retailer where we previously did not have enough space to accommodate them. So while for one example, at an 800,000 square foot wholly-owned prime plus power center in New Jersey, we proactively retained control of the RadioShack lease in the bankruptcy proceedings. This allowed us to control the real estate and consolidate RadioShack space with an adjacent small shop unit that was chronically vacant to accommodating a power retailer. We achieved the rent comp of over 33% and a return on invested capital of over 30%. Based on the deals which are already negotiated where we were simply waiting for leases to be rejected as well as initial expressions of interest, we are confident the re-tenanting of the RadioShack space will produce improved merchandise mix at higher rents and with limited down time. The simple nature of retail is that we will continue to see winning and losing retailers. We have consistently welcomed and proactively pursued the recapture of space occupied by retailers and declined. These situations provide us with a breadth of operational advantages and value creation opportunities. We continue to build relationships and execute deals with best-in-class market share winning retailers and we analyze all opportunities in great detail to ensure we are making quality deals that enhance the merchandise mix and economic value of our assets and create long-term value for our shareholders. I would now like to take a few moments to update you on our current development activity. As you know, we opened Seabrook Commons last summer. Seabrook Commons is a 380,000 square foot prime power center located north of Boston and includes Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, PetSmart, Michael’s, ULTA, Famous Footwear and Five Below as well as the complementary restaurant lineup consisting of Panera, Outback Steakhouse and Noodles & Company. Home Goods will soon be added to this strong lineup as they are slated to open this fall. Following on the success we are experiencing with Seabrook, we continue to make great progress on both Guilford Commons located just East of New Haven, Connecticut and Lee Vista Promenade located in Orlando, Florida. We broke ground on Guilford Commons last fall and the center is on track to open during the fourth quarter of this year. Guilford Commons will span 130,000 square feet and include best-in-class retailers, such as the Fresh Market, Bed Bath & Beyond, Michael’s and DSW as well as 40,000 square feet of shop and specialty space. We will be 85% leased at opening and expect to be fully leased in the first quarter of 2016. We also broke ground on Lee Vista Promenade in December and are on target to open the first phase of this center in the fourth quarter. Lee Vista Promenade will be a 450,000 square foot multi-phase project located in a heavily traffic area just north of the Orlando Airport. The center will initially be anchored by a theater and a great lineup of junior anchors and restaurants, including Home Goods, PECO, Five Below, Famous Footwear and others. In closing, as you know, RECON is just around the corner. As we head into this year’s show, our focus continues to be on the consistent qualitative and quantitative improvement of our assets. The leasing environment continues to be strong and we intend to take full advantage of this opportunity. As usual, we will have a full slate of meetings scheduled and look forward to having productive meetings with our retail partners as well as members of the investment community. And I want to remind everyone that we will be located at the Villagio again this year. And please keep in mind that our space will be open on Sunday as well as Monday and Tuesday. We look forward to seeing you there. And I will now turn the call over to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Thanks, Paul. Before I review our first quarter financial results, I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude to both David and the board for the opportunity to lead the financial and transactional arms of our company. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our talented and experienced team, our bankers, our partners and the investment community in my expanded role. I am excited about the direction of the company and our ability to generate above average long-term returns for our shareholders as we continue to strive to become a blue-chip organization. In conjunction with David, I will oversee two primary goals in order to position us for long period of our performance. First, to operate our business with the appropriate level of risk and second, to expedite our portfolio transformation, which is already seen over $2 billion of more than 250 lower quality assets sold in the past 5 years. Our first quarter activity is evidence of continued execution on these goals. Turning to the results, for the first quarter, operating FFO was $107.1 million, or approximately $0.30 per share. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $13.2 million, or $0.04 a share. Non-operating items primarily consisted of $279 million of non-cash impairment charges. In light of the attractive cap rate environment combined with the transition in leadership, this management team will further seek to accelerate our portfolio repositioning. And as such, we felt it is now prudent to review the basis of the assets we don’t deem to be long-term holds. This review has resulted in us booking in the first quarter, an impairment of $279 million, which includes $190 million of operating assets and $99 million of land. We wrote down five of our final six tracks of land and intend to market and dispose of these at figures close to the current basis. These actions support our message that we will operate with fewer non-income producing and non-prime assets and we will continue to utilize the markets low cap rate environment to our advantage. We expect any quarterly deltas between FFO and operating FFO going forward to be truly non-recurring. This decision was the first of many that this new team will make as we look to expedite the final stages of the transformation and report a clean and transparent earnings figure in future quarters. I would now like to begin my summary of the quarterly’s transaction activity by discussing the wind down of our legacy joint venture with Coventry. At the time of its dissolution, the joint venture managed 22 assets in an 80-20 partnership between Coventry Real Estate Advisors and DDR. As we had no GAAP interest in 18 of the 22 assets, the financial impact of the venture was minimal on a company wide scale. However, exiting Coventry mark a successful resolution of a significant lousily [ph] which the company successfully defended and it further exemplifies our goal of exiting smaller joint ventures which would no longer consist over the company’s business strategy in favor of longer term partnerships with large sophisticated institutional partners that would better align with the company’s current investment objectives. In exchange for our $0.20 interest in 21 of the portfolio’s 22 assets, we acquired from Coventry’s $0.80 interest in Buena Park Place, a 220,000 square foot prime portfolio of prime located in Orange County, California. As overall pricing continues to favor to sellers Buena Park Place has been our only acquisition year-to-date. Notwithstanding the environment, we remain confident reaching our acquisition goal for $250 million predominantly in the latter half of the year. During the quarter we disposed – obtained assets there by the Coventry joint venture, totaling $104 million of the company’s share and had seven additional assets under contract as are at quarter end totaling $80 million. And we expect that amount to grow – under contract to grow as we look to opportunistically dispose of assets at attractive pricing. Should this trend continue, we expect our disposition activity to exceed our acquisition activity in the first half of 2015. As announced last week, we closed on amendments to two revolving credit facilities and a new unsecured term loan. Pricing on both revolvers was reduced by 15 basis points and is set at LIBOR plus 100 basis points. While final maturity was extended from April ’18 to June 2020. In turn with this refinancing we entered into a new $400 million unsecured term loan, which is priced at LIBOR plus 110 basis points and has the final maturity of April 2020 and it’s currently undrawn. We anticipate we will draw on these in the latter half of the year with pricing used to address almost half of our 2015 debt maturities. And at the same time enable us to continue to grow our encumbered pool and quality with the addition of four franchise assets including Shoppers World in Boston. As we continue to operate the business with less risk, our leverage metrics will continue to reduce over time, but not at the detrimental value creation. This quarter was the last quarter that debt to EBITDA will be negatively affected from the prior corresponding period due to the sale of our Brazilian investment. This divestiture as explained in mid-2014 was the right long-term decision for the company allowing the reduction of our exposure to development, foreign currency and non-controlling investment risk albeit at the shorter term expense of debt to EBITDA reduction. Before I turn the call back to David I would like to address several modeling related events that occurred in the first quarter. As mentioned on February’s call the snowfall that hit New England at the beginning of the year impacted our first quarter recoveries. We incurred $1 dollars of non-recoverable weather-related expenses in January and February alone, nearly twice as much as we expected which closed the same store to deteriorate more than 25 basis points. Separately, temporary legislation in Puerto Rico has allowed us to opportunistically reduce our perspective tax rate on the island from 39% to 10% while restructuring the ownership of our assets into a REIT. When we originally acquired our portfolio in the island shopping centers were not a property eligible for tax treatment under Puerto Rico tax rule. Since the Puerto Rican rate structure was not about what the time and based on what’s held in a vehicle which is subject to the highest marginal corporate tax rate of 39% for operational activity and capital transactions were subject to 29% taxes. So with short-term we are latest initiative and the company’s productive discussions with taxing authorities we were able to opportunistically restructure the ownership of our investment into a group. Perspective tax rates with this new ownership structure will now be 10% for both operational and capital gains generating activities representing a tax benefit of 29% on all of our future operations on the island. In order to accomplish this restructuring, the company elected to pay an upfront tax priced upon a reduced tax rate of 12% on unsheltered tax or capital gains from its Puerto Rican assets. The time will also allow our tax rate to increase, which will generate future tax reductions. For reporting purposes, the tax payment of $20.2 million results in the creation of a tax asset of $16.8 million and non-recurring $3.4 million tax expense that has been added back to operating FFO. The investment is anticipated to generate double-digit returns in the form of savings from lower tax rate achieved in this transaction and represents another example of long-term focus of this management team. As a final note, we have updated and expanded the disclosure of our development and redevelopment activity in our quarterly financial supplement. We are breaking at all major redevelopments with over $10 million of total spend. We are finding all minor redevelopments under $10 million of spend and delineating further between re-leasing, which is included in same-store NOI and redevelopment, which is excluded from same-store NOI. The new content is streamlined in an effort to clarify modeling of our development pipeline and we hope that this expanded disclosure is helpful to the investment community. We have additionally included a summary of our top 50 assets by ABR in an effort to showcase the size, scale and quality of our largest assets and allow the investment community, to more closely monitor the properties that makeup approximately 50% of our value. I will now turn back the call to David for closing remarks.
David Oakes: Thanks, Luke. Further, we have referenced the earnings headwinds from higher volume of asset sales we remain comfortable with reiterating our original 2015 earnings guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 per share of operating FFO. What we do expect to dispose of more than the $250 million of original disposition guidance throughout the year, we are not altering our earnings guidance range as the range contemplates increased sales and we continue to find other areas where we can beat our budget. Operating fundamentals remains strong and we expect no change to our original same-store NOI or leased rate expectations. Thank you for your time and I will now ask the operator to open the call up for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Katie [indiscernible] on for Christy. Just a couple of questions on the targeted asset sales, do you plan on exiting any markets entirely or will it be more asset-specific? And then could you provide any additional color around the timing of expected dispositions in acquisitions throughout the year?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, Katie, this is Luke. You are not going to be specific to markets I think it’s an asset by asset basis. We are looking to reduce our exposure to assets that we deem as prime minus or non-prime, so ones that may have lower growth, but do seem good markets, you will start to find that the assets we are selling will be larger in size and probably attract better cap rates. So, they are becoming more and more institutional. It’s just ones we don’t see more medium to long-term. We are able to drive the growth that we are after.
Operator: The next question comes from George Auerbach of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
George Auerbach: I guess the $180 million write-down suggests a pretty large group of assets that you are going to sell in the near-term or looking to sell in the next 12 or 24 months, can you quantify for us what the amount of assets are that you have either on the market today or expect to put on the market soon? And I guess when you ran through the math on the write-downs, what was the assumed cap rate you were assuming on the sale of these assets?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, sure George. So, right now, we have – as we outlined, we had closed on the company’s share about $150 million at quarter end, that’s increased closer to $200 million and we are probably with what’s on the contract closer to $250 million today. What’s probably worth noting is the assets that we have impaired down? They will be – they will likely be sold over the medium-term not immediately. So what I think this should be saying is something that we are going to exit in next six months, but over the next 12 months to 24 months these are the assets that we are looking to exit. From a cap rate point of view, the cap rates of these assets are probably in the 7.5 to 8 cap range. They are smaller assets. They have a general household income and population that at 20% to 30% lower than our prime average so digested [ph] in weaker demographics and the NOI CAGR on these assets are less than 1%. So assets that we feel we can write a capital add off and into much stronger better performing assets over the longer term.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Spector of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jeff Spector: Good morning. Thank you. My question is back on the strategy David you in your opening remarks specifically used the word quality dirt, fortress power centers, can you define that a little bit more I mean we continue to hear more about hybrid centers, but again you are using very specific words on the strategy?
David Oakes: I think there are two way to approach it Jeff. And one of those is from a purely qualitative perspective where it is challenging to provide an exact definition there. I think from the experience of the large team that we have here working on this some of that comes down to just having seen thousands of shopping centers around this company – country being familiar with markets and submarkets and saying this is the location that makes sense, that has opportunity to improve over time, it’s fantastic amount of feedback that we get from retailers in terms of their current performance or their future growth plans that we take into account through the dialogue with a large number of retailers on a regular basis. So I think there is some of it where I can’t offer you any sort of specific definition that would define exactly what we mean except for we know when we see it when we go through a very large number of assets. The other side of it that I think we have made great strides over the past couple of years to quantify and to be able to offer a more clear definition is through our portfolio management efforts where we really have come up with three primary criteria on which we grade every asset in terms of what we think of the locational or dirt quality, how the tenants perform today and the credit quality of those tenants and then the value creation opportunities that we see over time. So those three buckets divided up into several sub-buckets where we do give each asset a specific numerical grade that they comes down to define our prime plus prime and prime minus in and non-prime buckets. And so while we don’t share them publicly, we do have a detailed analysis for each asset that really defines for us what we think of is a prime plus center or a fortress center as we mentioned earlier. And so on various property tours and other events we have showed off this analysis a little bit I think we will be talking about it more obviously something proprietary so not anything that we will be publishing. But I think a tool that’s been very helpful internally and looking at our portfolio and looking at external opportunities to provide at least a more quantifiable and numeric answer to your question of how we define quality in terms of either prime slots or fortress quality assets where we are – we have made great strides in moving the portfolio in that direction and we expect to make considerable progress as we look out over the next several years.
Operator: The next question is from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Grant Keeney: Yes. Hi, this is Grant Keeney on for Todd. I was just wondering David there is an uptick in M&A activity and I am just curious what your view was on M&A in the space and what role DDR may play if any?
David Oakes: We are obviously watching it very carefully. We do a considerable amount of work on any portfolio public or private that contains shopping centers where we would have any interest in owning it. We obviously have a great relationship with Blackstone where we have worked on a number of deals together that you have heard about because they happened and we worked on a very significant number of deals that you haven’t heard about, because they haven’t happened or haven’t happened with our involvement. And so I think we have got a good seat and a huge amount of research done internally to view those transactions and find the rare situation in a portfolio deal like with the ARCP portfolio last year where we thought it was a portfolio of size and a portfolio with extraordinary quality among the top assets, but also one that because of the situation the seller found themselves in where we were able to execute at very attractive pricing. And so in terms of checking both the boxes, quality and pricing, I think that was one that fit the bill for us as we have looked at other recent transactions we haven’t seen that it’s met both or even either of those criteria in some cases. And so I think we have got the underwriting capacity, we have got the information, we have got the operating platform that would allow us and now we also have the balance sheet that would allow us to be a consolidator. And so we are excited to have that opportunity. However, if something doesn’t meet the quality that we need and if something doesn’t offer an attractive enough financial return, we are just not going to be there and so that’s why you have seen us pretty quiet ever since the announcement of the ARCP transaction, which was just about 12 months ago.
Operator: The next question is from Jeremy Metz of UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross Nussbaum: Hey, guys. It’s Ross Nussbaum here with Jeremy.
David Oakes: Hi, Ross.
Ross Nussbaum: David, how much longer is the portfolio transformation actually going to last?
David Oakes: I think we can answer it in two different ways. From the perspective of the transformation that Dan and I originally started talking about probably 6 years ago or so, I would say, we are done. So, the scary part – the hardest part, the dilutive part that the most challenging part of selling true non-institutional quality real estate is overwhelmingly finished at this point. Massive progress has been made from an absolute peak of around 800 assets in early 2007 down to about 400 today. And so I think from what we have defined historically as the transformation we would say we are overwhelmingly done with that effort. I think the next steps of it going forward represents something much closer to portfolio management exercise of looking at the entirety of what we own and saying what represents something that has either lower growth or higher risk over time, but generally still talking about very institutional quality assets and other in some cases even savvy buyers have seen opportunity and where we think our capital is best allocated elsewhere. So, we really look at this as the continued refinement of the portfolio. I think a little bit of what you saw this quarter, the last steps of the cleanup of the land bank, but in terms of the operating portfolio really just the continued refinement to focus more clearly our capital and therefore also our team’s time on the highest quality assets in the portfolio. So, I look at this as something that should be a constant process for this company to continue to improve portfolio quality and to continue to maximize value were reduced to come with some of the negatives associated with those sort of activities, like considerable dilution or earnings headwinds. This is one where we think we can improve the long-term growth rate and the long-term opportunity to create value in the portfolio by some of these sales as well as the reallocation of that capital of certain acquisition and redevelopment activities over time. And I hope I get to tell you for a long period of time that we are continuing down that path even if it doesn’t represent a massive transformation like the one that occurred over the past 5 to 6 years was, but also one that significantly improved quality with the addition now of some earnings dilution.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there.
David Oakes: Hello.
Haendel St. Juste: So, David, a question for you on the persistent discount that DDR still appears to trade at versus your peers and to your underlying asset value, you have made significant progress over the past few years improving the quality of your balance sheet, your portfolio, the Puerto Rico assets continued to do well despite negative headlines for the island, power center cap rates have compressed, the CEO transition is over and the strategy of focusing on long-term high quality assets is the one we agree with despite perhaps some short-term dilution headwind. So the question for you, as you think about all of that what do you think perhaps investors aren’t appreciating or getting about your strategy and why that discount persists?
David Oakes: Yes. I think for us there is some level of frustration with the discount, but the reality is our focus has to be creating value within the portfolio and the challenge for analysts and investors is recognizing that value and changing some of that discount. But I think for us where we see the greatest misunderstanding is in the portfolio of quality, it’s one of the reasons while a very simple addition to the front of our supplemental package we have added the top 50 assets. We have always included a property table in the back that included all of the assets. But I think for us we consistently feel like the quality of the portfolio is missed and so what can we do to make it easier for people to realize that. Some of that’s running around with groups like the ones you put together to do property tours in various cities and some of it is improving our disclosure so that is more clear what assets truly drive the performance of this company. And so those top 50 assets that we break out earlier in the supplement, I think are helpful in getting people to recognize the quality of the portfolio. One thing we have always struggled with the portfolio upgrade over the past several years is that it’s much easier to show our portfolio improvement if you buy one trophy asset particularly in an investor-oriented sort of market, it’s much harder to show portfolio improvement. When you sell 400 low quality assets in much smaller less traveled to markets, obviously no one is doing that property tour of what you don’t own anymore even though from an internal perspective from a relationship with tenant perspective from where leasing managers are allocating time perspective the sale of the low quality assets actually does a lot more to improve portfolio quality than the addition of one or two trophy assets. And so I think that’s where we can continue to struggle to make sure we are telling the best story so that people understand the quality of the portfolio that exists today. Obviously, at the same time while we are executing on the next legs of making that store even more significantly true with transactional activity is driving even better portfolio as we look out a couple of years.
Operator: And the next question comes from Tammi Fique of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Tammi Fique: Thank you. I am just curious there is a range of disposition volumes kind of embedded in the guidance range that you gave for the year, I guess I am just curious what that is and at know what cap rate? Thank you.
David Oakes: Yes. I mean when you think about that overall $0.05 range on 360 plus million shares you get to a spread in FFO that can be made up from a number of things. Part of it’s to get us to the low end is accelerated. Refinancing activity where you take advantage of low rates, but you add additional capital and potentially sit on is the cash sooner rather than later. Some of it is earlier sales volume, some of it is greater sales volume, some of it was a concern months ago that bankruptcy season could have been worst than what it was. And so you eliminate some of those downside scenarios, but then give yourself additional opportunity to either sell more or accelerate financing activity in other cases. And so I can’t say that there is a specific range that that we have outlined just related to the single variable of disposition volume and pricing, but I would say we continue to be comfortable that our range is achievable even it being very meaningful ahead today of our disposition volume and so pricing is coming in a little bit better, but the volume of dispositions and the timing early on the year is significantly ahead of our expectations. And so today if we did end up $100 million to $200 million ahead on dispositions and thinking about the 2015 period alone having those much more heavily first half weighted on the – on the dispositions and second half weighted on the investments, I think even with all that, our overall guidance range is something we remain comfortable with based on the original way that we budgeted it in some of the cushion that we built in, particularly on the low end, so that we wouldn’t be prevented from taking advantage of either a strong financing environment or a strong disposition environment.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alex Goldfarb: Good morning. First, thank you for the added 50 asset disclosure. David, I guess the two-part question here. It’s the same topic. One, are we done with the major write-offs or the write-offs? And then two, on operating FFO to regular FFO, does this mean now that DDR, the operating FFO that you guys report is basically going to be the same as reported FFO?
David Oakes: Yes, I would say from a very comprehensive analysis that we have done over the past several months thinking about potential sales candidates, the timing of those and then how that flows into our book value for those assets versus what we think is the market value at a time that we might sell it. I do very much think that this is it in terms of any sort of significant impairment activity. I think when we entered into this analysis we wanted to make sure that we could answer that question with confidence. If the environment changes, it certainly means that valuations can change, but I think where we stand today, we believe that we have included everything into this analysis and would not expect some of the regular quarterly noise that you have seen over the past several years. And therefore, we would also think that operating FFO should look extraordinarily close to NAREIT defined reported FFO. There can always be certain truly one-time items. And I will tell you certainly with some of the transitional events that we are going through here, there is the potential that those sort of things could happen. There is the potential that as we work our way through some of the simplifications, some of the joint venture exits that we have gone through and continue to contemplate in other cases where there could be additional friction in the near-term, but I would say the overwhelming majority of it should be gone in on a go forward basis. I think operating FFO should look extremely close to NAREIT defined reported FFO, which we have consistently given, but obviously have included certain add-backs that we thought were more appropriate simply as we take the view on what’s the right way for people to look at the company, but I think on a go forward basis, it becomes even simpler.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, guys. I just want to go back to guidance for a second, I know we just talked about a little bit in terms of the ins and outs and some of the puts and takes that were baked into the original range, but if we think about sort of the discussion here, dispositions being accelerated and also larger maybe than initially anticipated and first quarter same-store NOI negatively impacted by higher than expected snow removal, some of the other operating metrics being maintained in terms of the outlook. Just curious, does that really leave sort of refinancing timing as the main sort of upside lever to keep you sort of comfortable with the range as opposed to maybe trending towards the lower end?
David Oakes: I mean, I would honestly say when we talk about refinancings role in this it’s probably one of the negatives in terms of our expectation and our execution so far to raise the $500 million 10-year bonds earlier than we expected. So, you have some savings from the redo of the credit facilities, but I think the larger picture issues we are looking at in terms of what’s the right financing strategy for this company? More often, those are going to be slightly detrimental to FFO per share for 2015 than beneficial. So, I think that’s another thing we generally think of is working against us slightly. Certainly, when you are thinking about the top of the range higher disposition volumes and earlier refinance volumes make that much more difficult to achieve. That said, we do think we budgeted appropriately and we do see very strong operations continuing, I think the historically bad weather in the first quarter is absolutely a drag and was absolutely something that we would expect to be non-recurring and allow for better results through the rest of the year, but when we take everything into account in terms of operations, financing and transactional activity, we remain comfortable with the range and think that, that will continue to show one of the better growth rates for FFO per share within the sector even during the year where we improved the portfolio quality and improved the balance sheet.
Operator: The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi, good morning. As you dispose of assets in the U.S., this makes your Puerto Rico exposure naturally increase, I mean, actually on your new disclosure page, I see three of the top five centers by revenue are in Puerto Rico. Could you just talk about whether this increased exposure concerns you regarding the retailer and shopper demand, but also the local economy in politics on the island?
David Oakes: Yes. We certainly acknowledge that we do have larger investments, I mean, Puerto Rico than others and then some of our largest assets are down there. They are also on their top 50 list and it’s top of that top 50 list, because of just how good those assets are and just how well they have held up over the past few years. Selling assets in the domestic U.S. had certainly in the mainland U.S. has certainly slightly potentially increased our percentage exposure to Puerto Rico. On the other side, when you look at the redevelopment activity and the acquisition activity from last year where we did increase U.S. exposure, I think overall the Puerto Rico figures have remained pretty consistent. And so I think we are comfortable with our investment down there, particularly because so much of it is contained in those top three assets that you note from the charts. On the broader question, are we concerned about the financial situation on the island? Absolutely, it’s something where we have been actively following it. We have been actively involved. We are pleased that we could work through our tax restructure in a way that benefited the island it terms of their interest in current cash, but our ability to significantly lower our long-term tax rates on the island. And the toughest part now was the uncertainty, not knowing exactly how the tax structure is going to be changed, how that tracks is going to be implemented in what that exact tax rate is going to be. There is nothing a market dislikes more than uncertainty if we would at least get the news of what the new structure and a rate was going to be. Then I think everyone can plan accordingly, but the period today of uncertainty is the toughest period. So, I think from a macro standpoint, we have to acknowledge all of that. From a micro standpoint, we have got high-quality, high credit U.S. domicile tenants paying U.S. dollar rent and doing very strong sales per square foot on the island. And so I think when we think about it from a pure real estate or DDR portfolio perspective is the dollar rent from Wal-Mart and San Juan, different from a dollar rent from Wal-Mart in Chicago or Dallas, we really don’t think so particularly when the occupancy cost because of the high sales volume is even better positioned on the island than it is here today. And so we are very carefully monitoring the performance of our assets. We are carefully monitoring some of the canary and coal mine sort of metrics like accounts receivable or 120 day more greater accounts receivable and not seen any great signs of concern when we look at how our assets are performing or our tenants are performing. And so we continue to stand by that in terms of what matters most for DDR’s very valuable investment on the island.
Paul Freddo: Yes, Caitlin, this is Paul. I mean, they are jumping ahead a few more specifics. As David mentioned, there is still strong metrics and opportunities on the island giving even with the uncertainty, we are just completing large redevelopments at all. So, in Hondo, two great projects finishing deals with people like Outback and Dave & Busters and H&M, these are big deals that are still happening on the island that everybody is concerned about. Still the consumer mentality we spend a lot of years transitioning from a local tenant base portfolio to a national base as David mentioned. And we are down to 15% of our tenant base were rent through out the Island is local versus national which is significant and something we stay focused on. I wonder since you brought Puerto Rico I want to give a shout out to our friends at Tobin [ph] I’m sure most of you have seen that beautiful project they built at San Juan opening timing tough but we are quite confident its going to be big success over time and helpful to all of us that have space on the island.
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Sullivan at Cowen Group. Please go ahead.
Jim Sullivan: David, your same-store NOI metric does not include major redevelopments obviously a contrast to many of your peers, is there a targeted number or metric that you have either as a number of centers or as a percentage of the portfolio that you believe might clear the hurdle for a major redevelopment investment and can you clarify what that hurdle might be in terms of return on cost?
David Oakes: Yes. I think it’s a good question Jim in terms of the way one, we think about the projects and two then how they will show up in reported results. And while you haven’t had much time to go through it, yes given the release of the new supplemental format last night I hope you do notice that we have taken some time to try to answer that question or part of that question with our disclosure where we break out, major redevelopments versus minor redevelopments and then everything else just being sort of re-leasing CapEx. And so while we can’t give an exact rule in terms of above or below a certain dollar threshold, I do think we internally characterize the assets and the projects into those couple of buckets so that we can present them in our development section in a way where people can understand here the handful of really big projects that anyone would call a redevelopment and here is the larger number of small projects in some cases are truly development, some cases are more in that just larger scale re-leasing budget. But overall for us when we were thinking about these projects it continues to be a very large number of $5 million to $15 million projects. And in those cases I think we are absolutely focused on considerable value creation. At this point I can tell you that means 9% to 11% average returns on the incremental capital invested into those projects and that we continue to achieve those returns that we have underwritten and in some cases are finding that we can do even better. The largest scale redevelopments at times particularly the two large California projects can be lower returns in that partially because of the very low cap rate environment that those assets would trade in before they are located as well as the quality of the asset, so we can accept something lower on those projects and still have extraordinary value creation in the larger projects like that to get a very significant focus from much larger group of people at this company and where we continue to move forward and continue to see successful execution that should lead to considerable and noticeable value creation on the large-scale projects and considerable although less noticeable value creation on that smaller scale redevelopment bucket of projects.
Operator: The next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore: Hi, good morning guys. My question Dave is first on any plan board changes you might have and then kind of on the same lines if you could talk about any organizational changes that you have either already done, it looks like some on the website are planning especially on the operating front, the operating side of the business and in particular what’s your plan to do with Paul’s contract when you renew that I think it expires into this year if I’m not mistaken.
Paul Freddo: David, let me jump in and Rich will address me. This is Paul. Couple of things, one I really love this business and as you guys heard today we have got a lot going on and it’s a lot of fun being here right now. I am completely engaged and focused on continuing to lead the leasing and development teams as we get this portfolio in positioned for the long-term sustainable growth, Luke and Dave have been talking about. We also have a phenomenal team in place here, especially at the leadership levels and it’s something that David, Luke and I look at constantly what the makeup of the organization is. And I am quite serving whatever the time is appropriate, we will be prepared for an effective and seamless transition whenever that maybe.
David Oakes: Yes. In terms of the other items, particularly related to the board with our proxy released several weeks ago, you will see several changes in the nominees. On the addition side, Alexander Otto will be joining our board. So, historically, he has nominated two directors to represent him this year. He is nominating one director and he is also personally standing for reelection and so an interesting dynamic we are not just two great representatives of our largest shareholder will be in the room, but the shareholder himself will be in the boardroom with us. And so I think positive in terms of his indication and interest in spending even more time on his investment here in addition to, if you go through the details of proxy having invested additional capital into its investment in DDR past year. So, I think a positive addition there on someone that has a huge amount of skin in the game perfectly aligned with our other investors and someone with very, very deep shopping center, operational and development experience and broader real estate experience in the U.S. and in Europe and retail experience. Other changes, there are two directors – two other directors not standing for reelection, both of which who have served us very well over a period of time, especially most recently the challenging time through the downturn, through the company and several management changes. And so I think those changes are clearly reflected in the proxy. The board gets a little bit smaller. I think it can work very well at that size, but it also positions us to have an opening to add additional talent over time as we potentially locate the right additional members there, but very pleased with the slate that we have in place and have nominated for this year. In terms of organizational change, I think this company has been in very good shape over the past several years. I think there are certainly some refinements that we are making there. I don’t think there has been massive change to the leadership of the company outside of changes in titles for Luke and I but I think we are very early in what hopefully is a very long-term opportunity to run this company. And so there is no rush to make immediate change. I think there is an opportunity for us to evaluate what we think is best to manage this company for a long period of time. And so you may see some changes, but certainly not a massive part of the plan given the incredible quality of the team that we think we have in place today and that particularly relates to the exact comments that Paul always was making earlier about his leadership position as well as a very strong group of individuals under him, not to create any alarm, but also not to the call Paul’s contract out, none of us have contracts beyond the end of this year and it doesn’t mean that all of us expect to be leaving. We have obviously had a lot of other things to deal with and we will figure out the contractual nature of the team going forward, but I think you have got a large talented and extremely committed and motivated team here that’s excited for the opportunity that lies ahead of us.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Good morning, guys. Just a follow-up on guidance questions, I guess, I am just trying to understand maybe what the thought process is at this point given that initial guidance was essentially what 250 acquisitions, 250 dispositions? I haven’t heard anything more specific than sort of a front half disposition versus back half acquisition, I guess a couple questions. One is sort of David on the acquisition side what level of confidence do you have right now as it relates to reaching that level of acquisition volume is there anything under contract what volume of opportunities are you seeing out there on the stuff that you like. And then I am just trying to understand what the spread likely will be when we get to the end of the year between the acquisitions and dispositions in terms of volume?
David Oakes: Yes. I think it’s reasonable to dig into some of those assumptions. Obviously, the transactions market that we are seeing today makes the disposition environment much stronger and therefore easier than the acquisitions environment just because it’s not easy, it doesn’t mean that I don’t think that we have an exceptional team that can identify some unique acquisition opportunities and would be hopeful that over the next several months we are able to execute on about $100 million of those and then hopefully filling the rest in the second half of the year. I am confident in this team finding enough acquisitions to get us to that $250 million of guidance. And even more importantly doing so on deals that we view are attractive doing so on deals that we view are case study sort of transactions that we want to show the investment community exactly what we are doing and so its not going to be easy to find attractively priced deals. You can obviously always spend more money if you are willing to compromise. You are disciplined, but I think even without doing that I do continue to feel confident and under Luke’s leadership the transaction team can find $250 million of acquisitions. Then hopefully we even have some of that to show you in the second quarter, but certainly in the second half of the year the way we were thinking about it today probably most likely outcome is at least $100 million of net dispositions and potentially $200 million of net dispositions just based on achieving our $250 million of acquisition guidance, but exceeding our $250 million of original disposition guidance. I think other places within the budget where we see opportunity is recalling back to the fall are we are making these plans and there existed uncertainty regarding management. I do think that we had to budget very carefully and so I think we continue to find that in some cases on the G&A side, there are opportunities. We are basically assuming that we would have a CEO in addition to the team that we have in place as opposed to the board ending up providing the mandate to the existing team. And so I think there is some efficiency there that can be picked up. I think in other cases we had as we usually do carefully budgeted on the operating side, where we did forecast a larger than prior year bankruptcy volume. And so I think we continue to find opportunities on the operating side of the budget where our strong platform is executed well, but also we budgeted appropriately. And so there are little bits of upside that we also find there. Some of that’s exact end of year number plays out and the lease termination fees and other shorter term things, but I think when we are truly thinking about the strength of the platform and the portfolio today continue to be pleased that operations are contributing to us continuing to be comfortable with the range despite an accelerated and higher than budgeted disposition volume.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Just two questions for me. First of all just would be Excel deal and again the implied cap rate on that transaction, just curious if you think and as new implications for you or for any of the other REITs that have a meaningful amount of big box retail within their portfolio?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, hi, Tayo. It’s Luke. I think it absolutely has implications for other REITs. I think we can think it’s a low 6. We did do a lot of underwriting on that portfolio. We look at a lot of things with and in conjunction with Blackstone. So I think the pricing that the market has seen is probably about right. There are some very, very good assets in that portfolio, but we feel the quality across the portfolio probably isn’t something that really speaks to DDR. As David noted in his opening remarks continual focus on quality of dirt and location really means that any sort of portfolio deal really it does have to be unique and has to be very attractively priced. So it’s still on that basis didn’t quite bite the boxes.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Hau of SunTrust. Please go ahead,
Anthony Hau: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry if I missed this, but in your last quarter prepared remarks you mentioned that you intend to access unsecured bond market later this year, now that you have got close $400 million our term loans, you would pay half the maturing debt, are you guys still contemplating on accessing the bond market later this year and what is the timing of that?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. This is Luke, so the answer is yes we still are – we still have about $900 million of consolidated mortgages on secured facility is coming due. So the $400 million as I noted funds almost half of it but we still feel that there is an opportunity for us to coming to the market in the second half of the year. The benefit of having the undrawn term loan allows us to choose when we draw on that so that we can do a bond deal earlier in the second half if we choose and we see the rights are opportunistically priced for us. But at the moment we do have an intention to come to the second half to help broaden some of the maturities.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to DDR management for any closing remarks.
David Oakes: Thank you very much for joining us and your continued support. And we look forward to seeing you either at RECON or at NAREIT. Thank you. Bye.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
29,SITC,2,2015,2015-08-01 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the DDR Corp., Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to [Meghan Dudwala], Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Company Representative: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, you will hear from President and CEO, David Oakes; CFO and Treasurer, Luke Petherbridge; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing & Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we filed with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 as amended. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I would like to discuss five items. First, the progress we’ve made internally over the past five months, second, the results from our annual shareholder meeting. And finally the three pillars that this management team has outlined and is chiefly focused on the progress on all fronts. The internal progress of this team given the mandate in February has far exceeded our expectations. We have retained our top talent, transformed the culture and put new controls and processes in place to focus our operations team on the quality and the quantity that are already having an impact on the bottom line. This progress was evident in this quarter as we produced strong same-store NOI growth and leasing metrics, all while we continue to encourage vacancy to upgrade the caliber of our tenancy. I am proud of our organization, thus far, and I am confident that our operational efforts and our produce-first, message-later mentality will translate into outperformance over time. And the team takes the recent underperformance where very crucially and it [indiscernible] motivated even further. Next, important changes were made at the board level following our shareholder meeting in May. We’ve welcomed our largest shareholder, Alexander Otto, onto the board, further aligning our board with shareholders as well as adding in very experienced retail real estate minds to the boardroom. We were pleased to receive very strong support in our proxy vote for the shareholder alignment compensation program and all of our other directors. There are three pillars that our team has outlined over the course of the year that I would like to expand on next. The first is our refining focus on portfolio quality that places greater emphasis on the quality of the dirt, which is evidenced by the 4.4% increase in rent per square foot since this quarter last year. As we continue to sell assets that do not meet our quality thresholds. While we’ve made tremendous strides in upgrading portfolio quality through the years, we have raised our standards and see a short runway for completing the final legs of the transformation. I’ll highlight the progress we have made such as they are wholly-owned prime plus and prime portfolio now comprise approximately 75% of pro-rata gross asset value of our company. These centers carry a small shop rent per square foot of $27.50, 17% above the portfolio average. And they grew same-store NOI at 3.25% for the quarter, above the overall 3% reported and indicative of the superior quality. Going forward, we intend to continue to reduce our asset count through the next few years between 250 to 300 assets including the sale of a large number of assets held in joint ventures with low economic ownership. Given where we believe we are in the valuation cycle, we have taken a very honest view of asset quality, and we’ll continue to also sell wholly-owned non-prime and prime-minus shopping centers into this market. For example, this quarter, we disposed of a 99% leased grocery-anchored asset in Georgia that was located outside of the top 50 MSAs and had a future NOI growth rate of less than 2%, as well as an asset in non-core market in New England where we recently executed a junior anchor deal, taking the asset to 100% leased with future growth of less than 1%. These two institutional quality prime-minus assets were indicative of our desire to exit low-growth centers and mediocre submarkets at attractive pricing in the mid-6% to low-7% cap rate range, allowing us to redeploy proceeds in the higher growth assets in the top 50 MSAs. That all said, our shareholders should be confident that we do not intend to reduce the balance sheet significantly or sacrifice earnings growth as acquisition opportunities and thoughtful investment activity should continue to mitigate potential dilution. The second pillar is capital allocation, which we believe is the most significant measure of group performance over time. Our cultural shift and increased controls translated in net effective rents that increased 8% year-over-year this quarter, and G&A expenses, excluding separation charges, have decreased 8% since last year. G&A is trending at only 4.6% of revenues, down 9 basis points year-over-year and near the sector lows. Our discipline was also evident in our acquisition activity as we purchased two high-quality power centers in Orlando and Houston and returns in excess of our cost to capital, which Luke will discuss in further detail. This organization is extremely focused on the returns associated with leasing, redevelopment and transactional activity, and we are pleased to see the results start flowing through to the bottom line in such a short amount of time. The final pillar is our lower risk profile, which includes not only a fortress balance sheet but also a fortress portfolio prime power centers that will maintain steady cash flow on all cycles. As Luke will elaborate on in more detail, we made important stride in the second quarter as we added four high quality shopping centers with approximate value of $700 million to our unencumbered pool by refinancing the maturing debt with our new unsecured term loan. While we view debt-to-EBITDA as an important measure of risk that will come down over the next few quarters, we also believe that its equally important components of risk include debt duration, size of the unencumbered pool and the asset and credit quality of our properties, all of which have improved dramatically. We continue to expect this company will absolutely operate within an appropriate level of risks to maximize shareholder return over a long period of time. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thank you, David. The overall leasing environment and resultant operating fundamentals remained positive in the second quarter as evidenced by exceptional deal volume and continued strength in leasing spreads. We executed 369 new deals and renewals for 2.9 million square feet, an outstanding quarter for our portfolio that is 95.5% leased. I’d also like to highlight the starting rents for the new deals and renewals at $20.35 per square foot and $15.04 per square foot respectively, both great numbers and both indicative of the positive leasing environment and the quality of our portfolio. For the quarter, we achieved a positive pro-rata new deal spread of 25.4% and a positive pro-rata renewal spread of 7.2%, resulting in a combined pro-rata spread of 10.2%. I would like to remind everyone that renewal spread based upon the starting rent in the renewal period measured against the last rent in the current term. What is not included in the calculation of this spread is any future contractual increase built into the renewal. In this quarter alone, we had 91 renewals with bumps averaging 3% per year over the starting rent, obviously leading to additional growth. And this focus on annual rent steps is one of the most significant recent changes we have made when negotiating and analyzing deals. Our overall leased rate at 100% ownership remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 95.5%, an increase by 20 basis points year-over-year. The nature of the flat leased rate quarter-over-quarter was due to a couple of factors. First, we sold low-growth assets with leased rates in the high-90s to 100% and acquired high quality assets with vacancy, obviously offering significant growth opportunities through lease-up and/or redevelopment. The second contributing factor was the signing of new leases on spaces that were already included in the leased rate. So despite significant leasing volume and strong spreads, it nets too little impact on the leased rate. Third, we continue to encourage vacancies from our weaker tenants such as Kmart in an effort to increase the credit quality and merchandize mix of our centers. As David mentioned and as we have talked about on many occasions, we are focused on improving the caliber of our tenancy as we also look to improve the quality of the overall portfolio. One great example of this strategy which also highlights the quality of our portfolio and the supply and demand environment is a deal we recently concluded with also within one of our Whole Foods-anchored Pine shopping centers in Columbus, Ohio. The lease for the current tenant expires during the second quarter of 2017 with no renewal options. ALTA agreed to sign a lease, a full 2.5 years before they will open in the fourth quarter of 2017 to control the space, far from their typical schedule and had a 66% markup in rent, all indicative of retailers’ desire for quality space and the steps they will take to secure it. The signing of the ALTA lease results in no change to our leased rate but a significant change to tenant mix and net value creation for this asset. Our pro rata shop lease rate for the entire portfolio for space less than 10,000 square feet is now 87.9%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. This is in line with our peer average when reported on this comparable basis and an excess of the 86% lease rate we disclosed in our supplement for space less than 5,000 square feet. I would also like to spend some time this quarter breaking down some of the metrics we report to highlight the differences between the four tiers of our portfolio. As David also mentioned, our wholly-owned prime plus and prime asset comprise roughly 75% of pro rata gross asset value and it is within this pool that we are seeing our strongest results. In terms of leasing spreads for the quarter, the new deal spread for the prime plus and prime assets was 28.8% while the new deal spread for prime minus and non-prime assets was 6.7%. For renewals, the spread for prime plus and prime was 7.6%, 140 basis points higher than those for prime minus and non-prime. Another metric worth noting is the year one starting rent for new deals. The starting rent for the wholly-owned prime plus and prime assets was $20.95 while the starting rent in the prime minus and non-prime pool was $15.83, a 32% spread between the two pools. To update you on Puerto Rico, I would first like to point out that 90% of our Puerto Rico portfolio value is comprised of prime plus or prime assets. 60% of the portfolio value was in the top three prime plus malls and 70% of the base rent is derived from U.S. based credit-worthy tenants, all of which emphasize the quality of our cash flow on the island. Despite macro headlines regarding the sales tax and debt issues, we are seeing reported sales across our entire portfolio that are relatively flat on a rolling 12-month basis with four of our top five assets actually reporting small sales gain. Additionally, our blended spreads on the island for the quarter were a positive 5.5%. While [indiscernible] as the low-double-digit blended spreads we are reporting for the U.S., they remain positive. Furthermore, and one of the most telling statistics an area we have focused on for the past several years is accounts receivable. We have and we’ll continue to work on the mix and credit quality of our tenants. And these efforts have been rewarded with an accounts receivable number which has remained flat year-over-year and is near a historical low for this portfolio. From a deal perspective, we are still seeing new retailers who view the island as an attractive location as they look for areas to expand. We recently signed a deal with Dave & Buster’s for their first location on the island at Plaza del Sol with an opening date of early 2017. We are also finalizing a deal with H&M for one of their first two locations on the Island also at Plaza del Sol with an opening in late 2016. These are significant additions to our top asset on the Island and represent strong statements regarding retailers’ views of the strength of retail on the Island going forward. In the back half of this year, we will recapture a few boxes on the Island including two Kmarts at their natural lease expirations. This will have an immediate impact on occupancy but will have minimal impact on our NOI stream as rents for these spaces are significantly below market and ultimately will result an attractive opportunities for rent growth and merchandising improvements. Finally, I would like to share with you the success we are having with our national accounts group which was reorganized in March with strong senior leadership. The national accounts team was assembled to leverage our operating platform and continue to foster quality relationships with our top 10 and other notable retailers with whom we want to grow. Our top 50 tenants comprised roughly 55% of total annual base rent and it is critical that we have a continuous open line of communication with these retailers. When you have 70 to 100 plus leases with any single tenant, there are undoubtedly issues that will arise and our retail partners know these issues will be resolved in a timely manner with the involvement of the DDR account REIT. During the month of July and August alone, our national accounts team will conduct portfolio reviews with 20 of our top 50 tenants. While we meet and have regular portfolio reviews with all of our top tenants, the daily communication between our accounts team and the retailers is even more critical. We continue to realize the value in having a strong national accounts program as we negotiate renewal packages with tenants, utilize high-level relationships to finalize or amend deals, and quickly obtain insightful and reliable retailer feedback on performance on our existing centers, as well as for potential acquisitions. Our relationships with the retail community are something we have emphasized for a long time with DDR. I have great confidence that the team we have in place will continue to excel and remain best-in-class in this extremely important component of our business. I would now turn the call over to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Thanks, Mike. Operating FFO was $111.4 million or $0.31 per share for the second quarter which is a 10% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $105.4 million or $0.29 per share. Non-operating items primarily consisted transaction costs. As David mentioned, we are pleased to report another quarter of robust transactional activity which included the acquisition of two prime power centers that we believe exemplified this management team’s disciplined focus on acquiring high-quality dirt at attractive pricing. International Drive Value Center in Orlando, Florida which we acquired at the end of April, is located in one of the nation’s strongest retail submarket. And it’s situated within 1 mile of two highly productive eight plus retail centers. Orlando Premium Outlets and The Mall at Millenia which both produce sales in excess of $1,200 a square foot. The center’s TJX, Ross Dress for Less, Bed Bath & Beyond are amongst each respective chains top performing stores. Willowbrook Plaza which we acquired in June is also directly adjacent to our highly productive Willowbrook Mall in Houston and offers significant NOI and occupancy run rate given its 87% leased rate. We view the opportunity to invest capital in Houston as attractive from a pricing standpoint combined with our relatively low exposure to the submarket. And we are confident the quality of this real estate and the submarket will perform well throughout the cycle even with any short-term headwinds. Both assets were acquired in excess of a six cap and in place NOI and provide considerable and visible growth over the coming years. And we are excited to have these efforts in our platform. The quarter further advanced our portfolio management activity as we ended June with $340 million of assets sold or under contract which will exceed our originally stated disposition guidance for the year of $250 million. Of the $60 million of closed asset sales in the second quarter, $56 million was attributed to seven non-prime and prime minus operating assets with the remaining $4 million consisting of three land parcels. The weighted average cap rate for the quarter was in the low seven cap range. We had $119 million of additional assets under contract for sale at quarter end comprising 18 operating assets and three land parcels. Five of the assets sold or currently under contract were part of the group that was impaired in the first quarter. And we are actively marketing three of the remaining 20 operating assets and the six remaining land parcels. 10 of the operating assets under contract for sale are currently held in joint venture with Blackstone at pricing in mid-7 cap range for non-prime assets. The sale of these assets will not have an immediate impact on the balance of our $300 million of preferred equity issued to the joint venture, although we do expect a modest reduction obviously from 2016 as additional assets are sold and we continue to improve the venture’s concentration to the highest quality assets. We remain focused on selling down the remaining non-prime and selective prime minus assets in our portfolio until we feel our asset base is sufficient to perform in all markets throughout the cycle. Although we ended the second quarter as a net acquirer, the significant volume of assets currently under contract to sale [indiscernible] expectation that will end the year as net sale. While we still do intend to make the $250 million of acquisition guidance announced in January. While we continue to underwrite new opportunities in a disciplined manner, we plan to invest disposition proceeds to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet until further acquisition opportunities as a source, which will lead to the accelerating our reduction in our debt-to-EBITDA in the second half and into 2016. Turning to the second quarter capital markets activity, I would like to draw our attention to select re-financings that have a significant positive impact on cash flow but potentially a negative impact to GAAP earnings. During the quarter, we partially drew down a $400 million unsecured term loan to prepay the $256 million mortgage secured by four assets, which mature in September 2015. As outlined in the prior quarter supplemental, this loan had a combined cash rate of 6.4%, whereas the GAAP interest rate was much lower at 2.75%. We plan to again to drawdown the remaining portion of the term loans beginning of August to prepay an unencumbered two additional mortgages, which encumbered three properties and have combined loan balance of $175 million, which has a blended cash interest rate of 6.2% and a GAAP rate of 3%. Assuming a 4.5% long-term interest rate on unsecured debt issuance, the refinancing eliminates $8 million of annual interest expense on a cash basis, but will add an additional $7 million of annual interest expense on a GAAP basis. For further color, please refer to page 39 of our latest presentation on the website. For additional color, on one and three quarter convertible notes maturing in November this year, which are expensed at a GAAP rate of 5.25%, our intention is to settle the principal of the notes with the cash proceeds from the long-term unsecured bond offering later in the year and any premium attributed to a conversion in shares by giving notice to the bondholders on October 6. Using yesterday’s closing price of $16.22, we expect to issue a little over 2 million shares on November 20, which are not currently in our diluted share count with no proceeds to DDR. I’d like to take a moment to elaborate on a comment made by David about how we intend to operate our business with the appropriate level of risk to maximize long-term shareholder return. What I specifically want to highlight is that managing and lowering our risk profile doesn’t necessarily come at the detriment of return to our equity holders. A good example of this is the continuing the material enhancement in size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool, which, during the last quarter, we increased by approximately $700 million from the refinancing activity I just outlined. During the quarter, we added some of our largest and highest quality prime-plus assets such as Shoppers World in Boston, Woodfield Village Green in Chicago, and Fairfax Towne Center in Washington, D.C. that now have greater operational flexibility, allowing us to more easily enhance each asset’s value over time. As of today, our unencumbered pool is internally valued at over $7 billion, which will be more than two times larger than what it was post our top financing in 2009. Not only is their pool larger, but the quality is better with the average asset size being 300,000 square feet, which is 80% larger than in 2009. What’s worth noting at this significant pool is something that differentiate DDR’s balance sheet from our peers, and provides us the ability to raise capital against this collaterals, well alternative funding options, present challenges. With that, I’ll hand the call back to David for closing remarks.
David Oakes: Thanks, Luke. I would like to conclude by reiterating our original 2015 full year earnings guidance of $1.20 to $1.25 per share of operating FFO. Operating fundamentals remain very strong. Our portfolio transformation remains on target and we continue to find avenues to mitigate the potential dilution from this year’s increased asset sales. Thank you for your time. I’ll now ask the operator to open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: Good morning.
David Oakes: Hi, Craig.
Craig Schmidt: David, I was wondering what's the trigger to get you to go - it seems a little further on the portfolio transformation, and maybe just a little more color on the assets you were selling like you had said low economic ownership?
David Oakes: Yes. I think you’ve seen us make extraordinary progress selling 500-plus assets in the past, six or seven years. So I do think there’s been a focus on portfolio improvements for quite a number of years. I think where it’s become more nuance recently as we’ve sold the truly non-institutional stuff, we’ve sold the truly non-prime product. And now it comes down to a portfolio management exercise of selling assets that are pretty good but simply don’t need our current criteria for growth or future total return expectation. And so I think as we have eliminated the worst assets and as we have seen a private market for shopping centers, this continues to be very strong. Everything is lined up to allow us to continue the sales process but selling higher quality inventory now than what we were selling a few years ago and therefore getting the much more attractive pricing associated with that. And so I think we’re just being more thoughtful as we take this next step in selling institutional quality assets, but one that we think the current private market values too highly and where we think we can redeploy those proceeds and do much more attractive higher growth assets and larger MSAs as we continue to be active on both acquisition and disposition front.
Luke Petherbridge: And Craig, this is Luke. With regards to the low economic ownership that’s just a reference to the joint venture assets that are being sold. So, year-to-date, we sold five assets out of the Blackstone joint venture which when we originally acquired that portfolio, we highlighted that there would be some pruning in conjunction with discussions with Blackstone. Of the 18 assets we have under contract today, 10 of those are in that Blackstone joint venture where our economic ownership is only 5%.
Operator: And our next question will come from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning, guys. David, just your comment about this focus on development returns and looking at sort of the overall construction pipeline in a different bucket between developments, major redevelopments and minor redevelopments. Can you break out by bucket, the average projected yields on those existing projects? And sort of thinking ahead to the future pipeline, what sort of yields are you underwriting to when you're thinking about the feasibility of ground-up projects versus redevelopment?
Paul Freddo: Yes, Christy. This is Paul. Starting with the redevelopment, John, so on the minor redevelopments and typically with all of our lease-up CapEx, our hurdle is going to be 10%. We would expect nothing less than that in terms of yield. On the major developments, slightly as some of these are our little defensive at times but also bigger projects and typically with assets that we’re trading over 5%, 5.5% cap, so something in the high single digits, it’s 7.5% to 9% on some of the major redevelopments, some still exceeding that 10% hurdle, by the way. And on the ground-up, as we said in the past, with the legacy land, some of the stuff we’re developing right now, all in, you’re looking at mid-single yields with an incremental yield somewhere in the 7.5%, 7% to 8% range. But we would expect, mostly with the major redevelopments and minor redevelopments to be in that high singles and north of 10% with the minors. The focus will still be spread. We will continue to look for development opportunities, major redevelopments, it’s going to be more. You’re going to see that are very exciting, and we’ve got in the early stages that will eventually make it to our reporting, and we’ll talk more about them in great markets, and great opportunities to create value. Minor redevelopments will continue to be a big focus also, and I would estimate that we’re going to be in that $100 million to $150 million run rate range on the entire redevelopment program.
Operator: And the next question will come from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Grant Keeney: Hi, it's Grant Keeney on for Todd. Good morning. Regarding G&A, you mentioned in recent quarters you had some opportunities, and it sounds like you've made some progress, but just wanted to get some additional color on the timing and scale, and just another follow up, it looks like 2Q, you had a separation charge, so as just see what a good run rate was for the rest of the year?
David Oakes: Yes. I think what you’ve seen in the first two quarters is we have been able to operate even more efficiently. And so I think you’ve seen most of that show up in results, obviously a little bit of one-time charges in terms of some separation agreements this quarter. But I think at this point, you’re seeing most of those efficiencies show up in the run rate. And so I think historically we guided to 5% of total revenues as a reasonable G&A range and certainly a G&A range lower than our peers for many years. And today, I think that number can be a little bit lower than that. And so I think you’ve seen now the first full quarter of that show up, and we think that can be recurring going forward, but wouldn’t model in anything else too significant on that front.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. So going back to dispositions, David, maybe you could wrap it up for us, easily digestible package, you guys just saw some JVs possibly and make some wholly-owned assets, but when you look at kind of total pool of which call consider non-prime or what's realistically you're going to sell over the next couple of years, what does that - on your share basis, what does that look like?
Luke Petherbridge: From our share basis. So when we look at it, I think this year, we’re probably going to achieve between $400 million to $500 million of sales which majority, we have under contract today. I think then as we look forward, as David pointed out, I think the non-prime bucket has reduced dramatically, just probably 20 to 25 assets in there which are smaller assets and a couple of $100 million there. But then it’s really looking at just ongoing portfolio pruning and rotating capital out of assets that we deemed that we can reallocate our equity into high growth assets. So I think over time, we could continue to achieve. I don’t think we’re going to have dispositions that are the size of this year. I think this year, is a larger year but I think going forward, we’ll continue to look at rotating capital. But we will be mindful on any sort of dilution that comes from that. I think we can mitigate a lot of that with one of the assets we’re selling, a better quality and we’re getting better cap rates on that which you’ve seen. This year, it’s sort of 7.25 level. I think the stuff we are looking at going forward maybe even tied on that. But I think it’s opportunistic of where we deem we can pull capital out of low growth assets or assets that we don’t believe has the long-term return profile that we’re looking for.
David Oakes: Yes. We’re thinking about two sides of it, Ki Bin. The first one is just, capital recycling which is a constant process but redeploying capital out of those prime minus assets with lower growth rates into higher growth assets where we think we’re taking no real change in current cash flow by swapping that, but we’re certainly positioning ourselves better for long-term growth. The second part of it is net buyer or net seller outside of that recycling activity. You saw some significant net buyer a few years ago when we saw pricing was relatively low for power centers, and we had an acceptable cost of capital. You saw as a net buyer. We significantly added to the portfolio and improved the portfolio through those years. Today, we look at the private market, and you see pricing is relatively high. And so, our natural response to that is to increase the volume of sales, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen for this year.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: Hey guys, just want to know I know I really just can’t pinpoint this, but in a more general sense, can you kind of walk through the Blackstone assets that you have? How many are left out of the original I think it was 70? And what you would relate to keep longer term? What that means? Maybe for fees and then getting the prep payback and just kind of walk through that whole deal in general?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. Sure, Jason. That’s right. There was 70 asset acquisitions. Five assets are bank sold. There’s another 10 under contract that we’d expect to be sold in the coming weeks. With regards to long-term ownership, we do have a ROPO on the top 10, so we’ve clearly identified the 10 that we aim of the long-term ownership. Clearly, we don’t have the right just to buy them. It is something that Blackstone controls. And their exit is something that they control. So, I think in signs that over the coming years, there is an opportunity that we feel we’re best – we’re well positioned to get control and ownership of the assets that we deem that would be long-term prime and prime plus assets but for our portfolio. What that means for the fees and the prep, I don’t think there’s any near-term impact for that. I think the prep will start to be paid down in the course of 2016. But not a dramatic right. But I do think that prep will start to come down. Obviously, the fees will come down, as well as we sell assets, but I don’t think this is a near-term catalyst where the ownership would change from Blackstone to DDR.
Operator: And the next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning guys. So, a quick two part on capital allocation, understanding your debt reduction goals and [your recent] funding requirements. What is the stock buyback today, separating your capital allocation thought with the stock down on 16 well below many of them are basically your own. I would also love to know your thought on the high coupon debt maturity upcoming during 2016 and 2017 rates and I guess 7% in 2016 and 6% in 2017. What's your current thought of these upcoming maturities and how are you weighing the opportunity to perhaps refinance that versus debt pre-pays?
David Oakes: Yes. Capital allocation as mentioned in the opening remarks and I think is talked about regularly as a very significant focus for us – you look back several years ago when I think we did have a more attractive cost of capital and the private market wasn’t reflecting the value and quality of power centers. We were an issuer of equity to buy shopping centers. So I think today, when we look at the considerable disconnect between the value, the private market value of our assets, and the public market valuation of our stock, certainly, we see a disconnect there. And absolutely I thought about it and considered share repurchase where we stand today, we do have other attractive uses of capital. But share repurchase certainly is something that we talked about and thought about and will continue to do, but if not active at all at this point. But certainly, it’s something that is on the radar screen for us with constant view that the balance sheet improvement is very important to us, and so not something that we would consider at the expense of our risk profile, but something that we do think is certainly possible. I think we’ve taken important steps in the first part of recognizing that arbitrage between public and private markets by being a considerable net seller of the assets recently and what we’re forecasting for the second half of that year – second half of the year, and would certainly consider all uses of those proceeds as we continue through the next several quarters on the maturities, I’ll pass it to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, Haendel. With regards to the high coupon paper in 2016 and 2017, we obviously still have financing to come this year, which is the converts, which is $350 million, 2016 there is, clearly is the [non-prime] which provides a nice earnings tow into a portion of that year. Repaying that early, I think, obviously, we'd need to economically make the decision or not, I don’t think it makes sense right now today. And then 2017, I just want to make one point on that, which is something I made in my prepared remarks is that although it is 7.5% in that year, we do have some dip, the difference between the cash and the GAAP rate for that year. There is a differential where the cash interest rate for that year is 6.5%, but the GAAP rate is 5.8%. So although, we do anticipate a significant cash saving on the interest expense, the GAAP savings will not be as much, although it won’t be quite the impact that we’re seeing that are highlighted earlier, but it’s probably just worth noting. There is a slight difference there. We do think that there is an opportunity over the coming years to do better than the rates that are coming, and we think that provides an FFO tailwind for the company.
Operator: And the next question will come from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Good morning, everyone. Just Luke, going back to your comments, I think I heard you say that you have about $400 million to $500 million of disposal you think, for this year. And I think it's year-to-date $300 million plus, including those that's under contract, so that seems like it's a little bit higher than we returned the last quarter. And I'm just trying to understand from a guidance perspective and I know the focus is on – not necessary on earnings per se, but with the guidance unchanged, and dispose stepping up a little bit, and presumably financing costs, maybe up a little bit from earlier in the year on the unsecured that's coming down the road. Just curious what are other levers that you've been talking about as being offset? Are those being pulled? What's actually being done today to kind of be able to get you to that midpoint?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. I think and David probably have some comments, clearly, there are some operational efficiencies that we are starting to see flow through. With regards to dispositions increasing, I think that comes back to the point David and I have been making is that this is the market that we see as an opportunity to sell not just only the non-prime stuff, but some of the prime minor stuff that we think has lower returns. So I think there’s an opportunity for us particularly in the second half of the year. And that’s really where you’re not going to have the full-year impact there, but we are able to sell some assets at pricing that we see is very, very attractive for the long-term return of this company. And we do believe that we are able to reinvest that capital probably not completely this year, but over time, we’re going to be able to reinvest that capital to generate longer term returns. We’ve just seen that the pricing for assets highlighted by the two that David mentioned in his prepared remarks. We’re seeing pricing that’s far exceeding what we deem as the long-term value of some of those assets.
David Oakes: Yes. I think, we guided reasonably operations could come in strong and that’s why we create a range so I think we – it contemplates some of the risks that could happen on the downside, it contemplates higher volume of sales, and earlier refinancing activity. And so where we stand today, we remain very comfortable with guidance despite the fact that we are absolutely on track to be net seller this year.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, good morning, guys. First, just on the prior question from Haendel, do you actually have a buyback program in place today? And then, as we think about the dispositions you talked about targeting $400 million, $450 million this year. So I guess after those how much more do you have left to sell if you are to kind of get to the ideal go-forward portfolio, and then how should we be thinking about the earnings growth profile for DDR here, as we look into 2016 and 2017?
Luke Petherbridge: So Jeremy, its Luke. We don’t have a buyback program in place. With regard to dispositions, as we’ve highlighted, we will be a continual disposer of assets, the size and velocity of that will depend on the market. We do have some non-prime assets although that is dramatically going to reduce this year. It’s really going into the prime minus assets which are just assets that we believe may not have the growth profile that we are looking for from our equity. So we are able to rotate those out opportunistically and reinvest that capital whether internally or into new acquisitions, that’ll be an opportunity that we’ll review at current mark or the market timing. So I do believe our goal is to build the portfolio that will withstand all cycles of the market or all market cycles and long-term produce the return. I think the one thing that I probably would like to note is that the vast number of assets so if we think of the number of asset we’re going to sell, the majority of those will actually – we’ll have a lower economic interest because they are joint venture assets that will be disposed off. So our economic interest in those assets vary from 5% to 20%. So the impact to our earnings is somewhat reduced.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Tayo Okusanya: Hi, yes, good morning. Just a quick one for Luke. Luke the page 39 that you highlighted in the presentation, trying to understand the passthrough and FFO impact of the debt refinancing. Could you just kind of walk us through that real quick, again why kind of like the big difference with regards to the rate cash-wise and rate GAAP-wise on these pieces of debt?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. Absolutely, Tayo. There’s a real reason why there was a different rate to GAAP is when you acquire assets, you mark the debt to market. So when we acquired using our hallmark portfolio that was debt that was actually put in place when it was the Australian joint venture. So it was done with long-term debt. When we acquired it, it was dramatically a shorter-term debt. So you mark the debt to market. I think that, yes, from a GAAP point of view or a cash point of view, we don’t have a dramatic amount of those. I think one thing that works the other way is obviously the converts which have lower cash to GAAP rate. But there are some pieces of debt when we actually acquired and assumed a debt that are going to have the differences. This is an abnormal year. This really is looking at home art is their largest one which we have and that was the Blackstone acquisition. As I mentioned, there is a small amount in 2017, but really it’s just the mark-to-market of the debt when we acquired the asset?
Operator: And next, we have Sameer Kanal of Evercore ISI.
Sameer Kanal: Hi, guys, David just going back to G&A and I was just curious as you reduce G&A just through a reduction of – is it mainly through a reduction in headcount or are you doing something else differently? Are there any other changes that you're doing internally more from, let's say, a sort of an expense savings standpoint?
David Oakes: Not really, any sort of noticeable head count reduction. Obviously, Dan transitioned out earlier this year and we didn’t replace him with an outsider, and so I think you have some simple straightforward stuff like that. When we look beyond that, it’s just being timing ways where we can operate more efficiently with the very high quality team that we have in place today. And so I think you’ve seen some of those benefits show up over the last quarter or two.
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: Yes, hi, just going back to asset sales for a second. About how long do you think it'll take to go from 400 properties now down to that 250 to 300 properties, because I know you talked about the selling the JV stuff, and I think that's around 60 properties give or take, but you're going to be offsetting with some new acquisitions. So what sort of timeframe you are looking at?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, Michael. This is Luke. I think that’s over a couple of years. I think the vast – as I mentioned, the vast majority of asset in number that would be sold will be out of joint ventures. So we don’t have total control over the exit of those. So we do think that the joint venture number of assets will start to shrink, but the platform is probably going to stay comparable size. So probably over the next couple of years, I think, you’ll see our asset count start to go down pretty quickly.
David Oakes: And I think we want to be careful that in a way that we were addressing this because we are talking about reinvesting a majority of that capital in the high quality larger assets versus fractional ownership of a smaller asset. And so, this isn’t a way of us trying to bring dilution in the upcoming years. We think the transaction market is strong enough and our team is executing well enough where this is really portfolio strategy. This is not reasons why we don’t think FFO will grow in excess of peers over the next several years. And so, it really is two separate discussions. I think from the portfolio standpoint, you will see a greater focus on a smaller number of larger, higher quality, faster growth assets, but we’re not doing that at the expense of earnings even in the short term.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ryan Peterson of Sandler O'Neill.
Ryan Peterson: Yes, thanks guys. A quick question from me, you've done a good job with the supplemental and simplifying things, so that is easier and clear for the Street to be able to model us. I was just wondering if you have any other initiatives or other areas that you expect to continue to provide more clarity to make it easier for the Street to understand guidance and what the out years are going to look like?
David Oakes: Yes, I mean we have that renewed focus on transparency. I think, for a number of years, we tried to be at the forefront of improving our disclosure, both through supplemental as well as through our regularly updated investor update to try to make both company and the industry as well understood as possible. So we can continue to make strides. Absolutely, open to your feedback. When people have asked us for stuff that they thought would be more useful, we’ve changed our disclosure a number of times. I think we’ve added some additional development disclosure this year. We’ve added some of the additional disclosures. Luke was talking about earlier just regarding the differences between the true cash benefit of some of our refinancing versus the GAAP earnings detriment. And so we’re trying to be very thoughtful with those materials to make sure that we’re as transparent as possible and people understand the strength of this business and portfolio, but clearly are open to additional ideas of what would be helpful because, obviously, we do want to make sure people have the best understanding possible of the strength of this company, our portfolio, our balance sheet and our expected growth rate going forward.
Operator: And then next we have Chris Lucas from Capital One Security.
Chris Lucas: Yes, good morning, everyone. I guess Luke, the question about the unsecured markets. We've seen companies that have issued earlier this year that spreads that have been wider than expected and some that have pulled the yields, and go on to term loan market, I guess what I'm wondering is, what is your expectation as it relates to the spread on the deal that you're looking at for later in the year and do you feel like the market will be perspective given what you're hearing from your consults at this point.
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. Chris, so what we’re hearing from our fixed income investors, so I think it’s worth noting that we do spend a lot of time with our fixed income investors. I do believe that we’d be receptive to a daily hour offering. I think there is a difference between DDR and some of the other issuer that came or gone to the private market, the main one being size and liquidity. I think it’s something that’s very important to bond holders at the moment. I do think a good example is DDR being able to issue $500 million earlier this year. That was in a time of uncertainty for the management team or we’re in management transition. And we still had a significant overwhelming amount of support from the fixed income community. So I do believe, right now, that we feel that we could make an issue – we could get an issuance done at most channels on the curve. With regard to where our spread is, it clearly is wider than what it was earlier this year. I think overall funding costs have gone up. I do feel – we’re seeing one of our peers in the market today. I do feel we would be pricing something around that $170, after 10 years sort of $175 to $180 area. If we issued today, I think we could probably do better than that if we were to start to move towards an issuance later this year. So I think we keep our eye on the market very closely. I think we’re looking at what channel we actually want to do. We look at obviously our maturity profile. And then also, it’s just going to be the amount of capital we actually need to pay back some of the debt which we’re going to refinance and then also some of the – with asset sales as well.
Operator: And our next question is from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Hi, good morning guys. I'm curious, you mentioned that you had reorganized the National Accounts team. And I'm wondering, what was the team like before, and I guess, what makes it better under the new reorganized team?
Paul Freddo: Yes, Rich. Good morning, Paul. Before, we had it structured mostly as multiple and in a quite a few accounts reps scattered that we kept track of and did a good job of that. I don’t want to make it sound like this is brand new to us. But it wasn’t as coordinated an effort as I would have liked. So, the biggest difference is really restructuring under a Senior VP who reports directly to me, and he’s got a fairly senior staff that works exclusively on some of these major accounts in terms of some of things like I mentioned, package renewals and the like. It’s something obviously we see with all of the mall players. And I just thought we could do a much better job better than we have. I mean, it’s producing phenomenal results. It doesn’t mean the deal makers out there aren’t still communicating and coordinating with their retail partners because they are. And they are the deal makers. But when you have so many large accounts, and I mentioned the number 70 to 100 leases with any single tenant, we’ve got quite a number of those, and it needs that higher level, higher coordination, something that all of us here at the senior level can get involved in. And it’s just going to produce much greater results, and that’s the significant change.
Operator: And the next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones, the CapEx per square foot you show on page 12, is that TI plus landlord works plus recent commissions, one of your what’s in that bucket? And our second question is just on your same-store base rents, why – I mean maybe you can talk a little bit about the 1.9% versus last quarter's 2.4%, and how that should – if there is any investment pulling that down this quarter, and how that should trend throughout the year? Thanks.
Luke Petherbridge: Yeah. On the CapEx, Ki Bin, that is all inclusive. We do have our landlord work, tenant improvements or tenant allowance and leasing commissions. So, it’s all inclusive, which we think is the way everybody should be disclosing their net effect of rent. We feel great about where that number has gone, where the net effective rent has gone. Your quarter-over-quarter starting rent was up. CapEx was down approximately 14% on a per-square-foot basis, resulting in net effects of rent that were up 16%. That’s a big deal, and that’s going to pay dividends going forward. In terms of that base rent, you’re looking at in the same-store account. There are a couple issues. Some of the bankruptcies were in there. Puerto Rico clearly had a little bit of an impact. But what you’re often not seeing are the new deals that assign debt at much higher rents that will eventually drive that number up. End of Q&A
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference is now concluded. We thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
30,SITC,3,2015,2015-10-28 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the DDR Corp., Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, you will hear from President and CEO, David Oakes; CFO and Treasurer, Luke Petherbridge; and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing & Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we filed with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 as amended. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I’d like to discuss four topics this morning including the advances that we have made internally and the three pillars that I discussed on the prior call which include progress on portfolio upgrade and the focus on quality of dirt and laser focus capital allocation and lower risk profile. Internal progress continues to exceed share price performance; the divergence that we believe will narrow over time. Our most significant internal strategy this quarter was the completion of three weeks of portfolio reviews, and reinstating this process allowed fresh eyes to analyze the portfolio for new opportunities including expansion, redevelopment, disposition, and exploring the highest and best use for our real estate. I’m very pleased with the results of the reviews. We identified over a dozen new expansion opportunities in several new redevelopment projects including opportunities to add multi-family, self-storage, and additional ancillary uses at a number of assets. As I mentioned last quarter, there are three pillars this management team is focused on, owning the best locations for the future retail; prudent capital allocation; and executing with lower risk profile. I would like to elaborate on the focus on high quality dirt and the last legs of our portfolio transformation in detail, as we believe this is misunderstood in the market. DDR does not need to sell assets. We’re not nearly in need [ph] of any transformation; there is no disposition program. We have sold nearly 500 assets in third session and last remaining assets that we have identified for sale are of a much higher quality and are being marketed opportunistically as a result of high market pricing. These are largely what we describe as prime minus assets characterized by growth for lower prime portfolio or risk in out years that is underappreciated today. Given current pricing for these assets continues to be in the 6% to low 7% cap rate range, we have taken a sense that this is a prudent time in the cycle to sell more than we are buying. Surprisingly, we’re selling the bottom tier of our portfolio with the pricing range that is comparable to the implied cap rate at which DDR is traded over the course of the past few months. Regardless, this decision should not be misinterpreted as downplaying the quality of our portfolio; it is more simply stance, different than Peter’s [ph] that selling in the historically high pricing is prudent. We have a rigorous asset quality prism that all assets are run through and we will not sacrifice our standards to align the short term bull market strategies. While the decision of sale when prices are high appears to be out of favor in the current market, we are confident that the judicious capital allocation decision will prepare DDR to outperform in all cycles going forward. The second pillar on which we are focused is capital allocation which was evident this quarter in higher net effective rents and prudent spending on minor redevelopments on. Our operations team is increasingly focused on return on capital which resulted in the second highest average in net effective rents since third session. And we believe that improved deal economics create more value for our shareholders than quarterly volume statistics. The third pillar on which we continue to execute is operating with a lower risk profile, which was reflected in our decision to sell good assets with suboptimal credit or growth profiles and augment our portfolio to include more power centers situated on the highest quality dirt. While many market participants define it as simply by quantitative leverage metrics, we feel the quality of our EBITDA is at least as important as its ratio to debt. And we will continue to upgrade the income stream to both -- to perform in both bull and bear markets. With that said we intend to be a net seller of assets in 2015 and potentially 2016 and therefore should benefit from debt to EBITDA reduction in the coming quarters. Additionally, subsequent to quarter-end, we issued $400 million of 10-year unsecured notes for the 4.25% coupon. The proceeds from this issuance will be used to repay $350 million of convertible notes in November. Our decision to commence the offering prior to the maturity of convertible notes despite the market volatility and cost of carry is directly representative of our focus on reduced risk when it comes to liquidity, duration and highly of capital raises. To conclude, our team comes to work every day focused on building a fortress portfolio of power centers, allocating capital prudently to provide the best risk adjusted returns for our shareholders and by operating at the level of risk to allow for outsized growth in the strong market and sustainable cash flow and refinancing capacity in a weaker one. We appreciate the support of both our board and those long-term investors who recognize this as a long cycle business and have supported the Company. As I mentioned on last quarter’s call, this team does not take underperformance lightly. However, we have conviction that steps undertaken today will result in increased net asset value position over the long term. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks, David. The overall leasing environment and operating fundamentals remained positive in the third quarter. We continued to experience strong retailer demand and deal volume as we executed 382 million new deals and renewals for 2.9 million square feet, a significant volume for a portfolio that is 95.5% leased. I’d like to specifically highlight the starting rents for new deals and renewals at $19.70 per square foot and $15.75 per square foot respectively, both great numbers and indicative of the leasing environment and the consistently improving quality of our portfolio. Furthermore, net effective rent per square foot for new deals at $15.78 represents the strongest performance in years and cost as percentage of net effective rent remained in line with our historical average. Same-store NOI was also strong in the third quarter as the 3.2% increase is in line with our top quarters in the past several years. Leading same-store growth were highly occupied prime plus assets that continued to generate significant mark-to-market opportunities. For example, the top contributing assets this quarter were Midtown Miami, Shoppers World in Boston and Woodfield Village in Chicago, three of our highest quality assets. All three benefitted from strong new lease growth and remerchandising efforts as we added the likes of Nordstrom Rack, Cost Plus and Trader Joe’s respectively. Turning to spreads: For the quarter, we achieved a positive pro rata new deal spread of 12.3% and a positive pro rata renewal spread of 7.1%, resulting in a combined pro rata spread of 7.9%. While the new deal spread is lower than the recent past, it is important to note that we had a smaller number of box deals in our account [ph] pool than in the last few quarters and the larger box deals naturally have the most significant impact on spreads. Rent trends, as evidenced by the strong starting rents and net effective rents, remain very positive and we expect new deals spreads to remain comfortably in the double-digit for the foreseeable future. It is also worth noting that 81% of all new deals and 42% of renewals and options executed this quarter contained rent bumps within their initial terms, leading to additional growth beyond the reported spreads which of course are based on first year cash rental with a last year cash rent and do not reflect this additional growth from contractual increases. This focus on rent steps is one of the most significant recent changes we have made as we negotiate and analyze deals and one that we continued to leverage during the quarter in which we experienced a tenant retention rate of over 90% versus a typical retention rate of 85%. Our overall leased rate remained flat quarter-over-quarter at 95.5%. The flat leased rate was due to a few fasters. First, we continued to sell low growth assets with leased rates in the high 90s to 100% and in the third quarter sold 2.3 million square feet with an average leased rate of 96.5%. The second contributing factor was the signing of new leases on spaces that were already included in the leased rate. Despite significant leasing volume resulting in improved tenant mix and credit quality, these deals resulted in little impact on leased rate. Third, we continued to encourage vacancy from weaker tenants such as Kmart in an effort to further increase the quality and mix of our centers. As we have talked about on many occasions, this focus on improving the caliber of our tenancy will result in mixed results in a leased rate on a quarter-by-quarter basis. With that said, we continue to make progress in the small shop category at the lease rate for space under 5,000 square feet increased 50 basis points sequentially, driven primarily by strong net absorption. I’d like to take a few moments to update you on the progress we are making in two of our larger redevelopment projects, The Pike Outlets in Long Beach, California; and Sycamore Crossing in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Pike Outlets located in Long Beach is a 363,000 square-foot outlet center serving several communities in Los Angeles County including Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. After a thorough analysis, we found a significant void in the surrounding trade area for a mix outlet tenants and made a decision to proceed with the format in 2013. Following a tremendous effort from our leasing team, we held a grand reopening on October 2nd, and tenants including Nike Factory, H&M, F21 Red, Converse Factory and Gap Factory all opened strong and are performing well. Furthermore, earlier this year, Restoration Hardware outlet nearly doubled its size, store cycle and expansion; and they continue to perform extremely well. In addition to the recent openings, we now have signed leases with Columbia Sportswear, Cotton-On, Hot Topic and Starbucks. The Pike Outlets is now 88% leased and we have strong retailer interest for the remaining space. As a further demonstration of support for this redevelopment, Cinemark underwent a multimillion dollar renovation to bring their latest and greatest technology, seating, and customer experience to the project. All major redevelopment work will be complete in the fourth quarter and we expect the project to be stabilized in the third quarter of 2016. The second project is Sycamore Crossing in Cincinnati, Ohio. Located directly across from Kenwood Mall and a dense retail corridor with average household incomes of $89,000, Sycamore Crossing is a 390,000 square-foot prime plus shopping centre, also undergoing a major redevelopment. Sycamore was initially acquired in a JV with Blackstone in 2013 and we acquired Blackstone’s interest in 2014. Given strong retailer demand and the center’s location in the heart of the number one shopping area in Ohio, we saw the opportunity to invest and significantly drive NOI and create value. At acquisition, the center included an undersized and non-prototyped Dick’s Sporting Goods and oversight [ph] Staples, naked leases for Barnes & Noble, and Old Navy and significant vacancy. Other existing tenants included the Fresh Market, Macy’s Furniture and Ulta. We have allowed the Barnes and Old Navy leases to expire and right-sized and relocated Staples to make way for a new state of the art, two-level Dick’s Sporting Goods and a new Five Below. We have also backfilled Barnes & Noble with T.J.Maxx and are in active negotiations with other best in class retailers for an additional 50,000 square feet. Staples opened in a new space at the beginning of October and Dick’s Sporting Goods will be opening along with Five Below during the fourth quarter of 2016. When complete, this will be the dominant power center in the strongest submarket in the MSA with a grocery component and further opportunity for NOI growth and value enhancement. To provide an update on Puerto Rico, which comprises approximately 10% of pro rata based rental revenue, I would like to reiterate a few important points that I mentioned on our call last quarter. 90% of our Puerto Rico portfolio value was comprised of prime plus or prime assets; 60% of the portfolio value is in the top three prime plus malls; and 70% of the base rent is arrived from U.S. based creditworthy tenants, all of which emphasize the quality of our portfolio and cash flows on the island. While the macro environment continues to be traded poorly in the media, year-to-date we have experienced 360,000 square feet of total leasing activity on the island and continue to see reported sales across our entire portfolio that are relatively flat on a rolling 12-month basis with four of our top five assets actually reporting small sales gains. From a deal perspective, we are still seeing new retailers who view the island as an attractive location as they look to expand. In addition to the Dave & Buster’s deal we executed during the second quarter for their first location on the island at Plaza del sol. In the third quarter, we signed a lease with H&M for one of their first two locations on the island at Plaza del sol with an opening date in late 2016. These are significant additions to our top asset on the island and represent strong statements regarding retailers’ views of the long-term strength of retail in Puerto Rico. As noted previously, we recently recaptured two Kmart fosters [ph] in Puerto Rico at natural lease expiration. Kmart departures did have an immediate impact on our occupancy but will have minimal impact on our NOI stream as rents for these spaces are significantly below market and ultimately will result in attractive opportunities for rent growth and merchandising improvement. In closing I’d also like to turn your attention to a new disclosure in our quarterly supplement indicating which of our properties including the grocery component. As you know we have consistently referred to as a preeminent owner of high quality power centers which while we agree with the characterization fails to account for the everyday traffic that more than two-thirds of our properties benefit from with tenants offering groceries such as Walmart, the world’s largest grocer and others include Sprouts, Kroger, Publix and Whole Foods. As you know from private market pricing, top power centers with a grocery component and top MSAs are consistently trading in the mid-5% cap rate range. And we thought it’s appropriate to highlight our significant exposure to this property type. I’ll now turn the call over to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Operating FFO was $113.5 million or $0.31 a share for the third quarter, which was 6.9% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $113.4 million, also $0.31 per share. Non-operating items consisted of transaction costs. I’d like to begin today by providing more color on our quarterly and year-to-date transactional activities and the final stages of our portfolio repositioning. During the third quarter, we closed on the sale of 19 institutional quality operating assets for a 143 million at our share, bringing full year share of dispositions to 358 million with an additional 268 million on the contracts that we expect to close by year-end. As David mentioned, we have exceeded our original disposition guidance because the current environment exhibits extremely attractive pricing for our product term. [Ph] I’d like to emphasize that our dispositions today are not comparable to the assets we sold shortly during or after the recession. Our dispositions in 2009 sold for weighted average cap rate of about 9%. These assets were primarily located in tertiary markets, had weak merchandising mix, and the mediocre quality of the real estate kept occupancy level challenged following retailer bankruptcies. In contrast, our year-to-date dispositions are sold for weighted average cap rate in the low to -- or mid to low 7 and have an average of a 125,000 square feet and 97% leased. These assets are stabilized, institutional quality centers but typically have lower growth profile than we underwrite in our prime plus assets. To illustrate this further, we sold to an institutional buyer a Walmart neighborhood anchored power center located in North Charleston, South Carolina, at the end of the third quarter for a mid-6 cap rate, nearly a 150 basis points inside our internal valuation. The center has a decent merchandising mix, solid credit from national tenants and some future growth but minimal opportunities for value creation and is situated in a site [ph] that may post risk of selling vacancies in the next downturn. We are also on the contract to sell a prime minus fresh market anchored stabilized power center in Chattanooga, Tennessee for a sub-6 cap rate. The center’s other tenancies include Hobby Lobby, Shoe Carnival and Best Buy, all of which are generating good sale volumes. Both of these examples highlight a focus on opportunistically rotating our capital into other opportunities which will deliver the higher longer term returns to our shareholders. This is something we will continue to do if this level of pricing persists. To-date, we have additionally sold 14 assets from our third joint venture with Blackstone, totaling 213 million at a price approximately $0.20 higher than our acquisition just 12 months ago. The sale of these assets contemplated prior to the acquisition has not had any impact on the 300 million of preferred equity issued to the joint venture. But we do expect the balance to reduce ratably as we continue to sell the lower quality assets in the joint venture. We ended the third quarter with 626 million of assets sold or under contract and we remain confident that we will meet our original acquisition guidance of 250 million at the end of the year and end the year as a net seller. I want to spend a few minutes now looking into 2016, our residual non-prime portfolio and our expectation for further portfolio enhancements. We currently have 30 wholly-owned non-prime assets, representing approximately 4% of our value and estimate by the end of the year ‘16 there will be less than a dozen assets representing 2% of the value. We want to ensure people understand that due to the significant reduction of this non-prime tool, any further dispositions will be considered with extreme price sensitivity. If the transaction markets continue to exhibit the depths and strengths that we have seen in 2015, we will continue to opportunistically take advantage of them in 2016 and be a net seller, although most likely to a smaller magnitude than ‘15. Conversely, if pricing softens, we are absolutely comfortable with our portfolio with its tenancy and locations that we can generate appropriate returns throughout the next cycle and are confident that the considerable net proceeds writes issue [ph] can be effectively reinvested in the future. With regard to our joint venture platform, we continue to review with our institutional capital partners, the pruning of their portfolios over time. However, due to our minority economic interest which varies from 5% to 20%, the economic impact is minimal. Turning to capital markets activity: After observing the volatility and the unsecured debt marketing in late Q3, we are extremely pleased to issue 400 million of 10-year unsecured notes at 4.25% coupon earlier this year, early this month and take advantage of a sub-2% U.S. treasury. The issuance is nearly five times oversubscribed, allowing us to price inside expectations and roughly in line with our secondary. The proceeds will be used to fund the November redemption of 350 million of convertible notes and the remainder will use to pay down our line of credit. With the anticipated near-term asset sales, we feel that we have sufficient liquidity that we’ll be able to fund all upcoming debt maturities and are not required to raise any further capital for at least 12 months and possibly longer. As David mentioned, one of the three pillars by which this new management team is operating is an increased on the appropriate risk profile. While we continue to underwrite new acquisition and redevelopment opportunities, we anticipate that asset disposition proceeds as well as EBITDA growth will allow us to lower debt to EBITDA by one turn in the next two years. However, we continue to acknowledge that risk reduction goes beyond net debt to EBITDA ration. And prudent capital allocation has allowed us to capitalize on favorable market trends to better position our portfolio for long-term value creation. With that I’ll hand the call back to David.
David Oakes: Thanks, Luke. I would like to conclude by updating you on our 2015 full-year operating FFO per share guidance. We are now forecasting a range of $1.21 to $1.24 per share, representing a $0.1 tightening on both the ends and a mid point that continues to alight with our original 2015 guidance and equates to 6% growth over 2014. We will release 2016 earnings guidance in January as the normal practice. And we feel confident that the strength of our operating fundamentals, and our ability to source new acquisitions, reduce expenses, and find new key strings [ph] will mitigate earnings dilution from a considerable opportunistic asset sale program that is currently forecasted in the market and will continue to allow us to grow, both in the short term and in the long term. Thanks for your time. And I’ll now ask the operator to open the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital.
Todd Thomas: David, you talked briefly about the portfolio reviews and that you’ve identified more than dozen new expansions and some development opportunities including some densification projects, I guess adding other uses, you mentioned like multifamily of self-storage. Can you just provide some color on these future opportunities; what the scope might look like over time? And then in instances where there are other uses involved, whether DDR would look to bring in a partner or whether the Company would operate some of those other properties?
David Oakes: Sure. I’m happy to give you a little color. I think until we advance this further, I’m not going to give extraordinary detail. But certainly we’re pleased with the progress we made going through the entire portfolio and finding opportunities where given the focus on quality locations at some points we found that there was more that we could do on a site. I think we’ve given clear guidance that near-term, we think the credible, profitable redevelopment spend is in the $100 million a year range. And so some of this goes to backfilling that pipeline as you look into the out years and some of it hopefully goes to expanding that type line, as we look at more opportunities to expand or reconfigure existing centers or just add density as we are finding a few opportunities where that’s possible, and we think very profitable. We will continue with I think very prudent stance on the fact that we think we are extremely good at operating and developing power centers and at allocating capital but not necessarily experts in other property types since we think it’s reasonable to assume that if we did find opportunities for other property types on our assets, on our locations that we would look to either monetize that or look to bring in a partner if we did pursue that where we would not be -- or highly unlikely that we would be doing that on our own at this point.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Bilerman of Citi.
Michael Bilerman: You guys spoke a little bit about sort of the Blackstone joint venture in terms of the asset sales that have occurred since you’ve closed the deal last year. Can you sort of just talk a little bit more broadly? It looks though debt has been paid down; your preferred hasn’t been touched, I’m curious why Blackstone is not paying off the highest part of the cap structure, the most expensive. And so, can you talk a little bit about A, why that’s occurring; and then, what’s happening with that piece of paper? I think it was 300 million to start and I’ve seen they’ve gone up to 3,000. I don’t how much of that’s accounting versus actually a crude interest on your note. And how you are going to deal with this? It’s an 8.5% piece of paper, 6% of your FFO, clearly that’s going to create some headwinds once it does become redeemed, both from the debt to EBITDA perspective but also from an earnings perspective. So maybe you can just talk about it overall. Thanks.
Luke Petherbridge: Sure, Michael. This is Luke. So, with regards to the asset sales that have happened to-date, the original deal was that the first tranche that we knew and we allocated to sell that there was no initial pay down of the preferred. So the preferred was sized in the capital structure, so that first tranche of asset would be sold and in proceeds paid out to common which is DDR and Blackstone. Going forward, we would expect that to change as we continue to prune that portfolio down; we’d expect to see that preferred reduce. However, I would like to note that we are in a partnership with Blackstone and sales do need partner consent. So, I think that was one thing that I’d like to make sure people are aware of that we work with our partner. We have identified a group of assets that we will likely sell in next year and that is probably likely to pay down the preferred. With regards to the preferred going from 300 million to 310 million, the actual preferred is priced at 8.5%; you’re right, but 6% is payable in cash, 2% is payable in time. So the preferred slowly increases a small amount every year that is consistent with prior Blackstone deals that DDR has done. And we feel very comfortable about slowly letting that increase. And then the final point of your question is, is really regard to the conversion of the order reinvestment of the 8.5. I think probably the best way to point that out is the historical first two transactions we both had preferred equity investments. We have successfully been able to reinvest that capital into a takeout of Blackstone. I don’t want to preempt anything happening in the near term with them. However, we do have a very-very good relation with Blackstone. We do like a significant portion of the value of that portfolio and would see that the 310 million, which is probably going to reduce over the next 12 months, would be reallocated into common equity or wholly-owned assets in the medium-term.
Operator: And next we have a question from Jeremy Metz with UBS.
Ross Nussbaum: Hey, good morning guys. This is actually Ross Nussbaum here with Jeremy. If I think about the industry for a second, do you think that industry occupancy has peaked? I mean I look at this year, I see two big grocer bankruptcies on the coast. I look ahead to the next year and think about the future of the Sears and Kmart and a couple electronic boxes for example. Do you think that we’re in an environment where we actually could see both your occupancy as well as industry occupancy to lift a little here over the next 12 to 24 months?
Paul Freddo: No, I really don’t, Ross. I would look at full occupancy for us and most of our peers as being closer to about 96.5%. Obviously we talk about some of the deals we’re making where we are taking tenants out and replacing which is not going to be reflected in an increase in leased rate and may even short-term, if there is a lag in expiration or termination and lease signing result in a little bit of a decline in the leased rate but all for the good of a long-term growth and driving the value of the asset. Even with some of the bank -- potential bankruptcies and bankruptcies you mentioned, in our portfolio for example, we had just one A&P and we’re not going to have any problem backfilling that should that be rejected, it has not yet been rejected. And we might see a quick slip because it’s a larger box but we’ll fill it quickly. I’m still looking at a full occupancy rate of again somewhere north of 96. It’s lumpy quarter to quarter as I claimed in the script based on some of our actions. But the little bit of whether there’s an electronics and again, we don’t really see that as a real potential for near term bankruptcy, it’s been pretty good in our sector quite frankly in terms of bankruptcy. I don’t think we’re going to see this thing slip. Again you’ll see some lumpiness but I don’t think you’ll see many of us slip beyond our current levels.
David Oakes: The broader question from an overly macro standpoint is a very tough one. For us when you look at the 4 billion or so square feet in the total database that the national brokers will talk about, I understand your sensitivity on that question but I think exactly as Paul was saying, when you look at the higher quality portfolios like ours, we certainly don’t see any of that risk even if on a true macro basis you might be able to make a bit of case that you got one.
Operator: And our next question is from Paul Morgan of Canaccord.
Paul Morgan: Just maybe a little bit more on the dispositions, as you think about 2016, if I look at a couple of the deals that you sold in the last quarter or in some large markets Tampa, D.C. I mean how should we think about those sales? And kind of we’re used to thinking of your dispositions as being not necessarily tertiary, in a secondary market; I mean could we see more in major markets as we see them maybe being kind of flat access going forward and is that changing kind of what is your longer term pipeline.
Luke Petherbridge: Paul, it’s Luke. And I think that’s absolutely what you expect to see. I think we have exited from definitely as a percentage of value out of predominantly nearly all of our tertiary markets and you will start seeing it. So what we would consider prime minus assets whether they’re in Tampa or St. Louis markets that we like but we just don’t see that it has the growth profile but we feel we can reinvent our capital into our prime plus portfolio. I guess a really good way to think about that is between 2008 and 2013 we sold over 300 assets for about $2.9 billion, so a little less than $10 million per asset. Right now, we’ve got about 200 -- at the end of the third quarter, we had about 270 million under contract with 10 assets. So, the size of the assets that we are selling is 2 to 3 times larger than what we’ve done historically, which goes to show not only the quality but the size of the asset where we’re rotating out of and then obviously then the reinvestment side, we are obviously buying bigger, more dominant power centers like Willowbrook we acquired earlier this year.
Operator: And the next question is from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: I am going to assume there is a continued aggressive transaction market and therefore you will continue to make dispositions. And I sort of see three buckets as use of proceeds, buying prime assets; investing in your redevelopment pipeline; and paying down debt. I just wonder which of those three buckets will see the most activity.
Luke Petherbridge: Craig, this is Luke. So, I think we do -- as David highlighted, we do have an active redevelopment pipeline. So, we have about 100 million to 150 million, so that is something that we can allocate. So, I think then really the residual bucket is going to be particularly in the near term, between debt and new acquisitions, I think very short term is paying down debt. But we do still feel that we can find attractive -- and attractively priced opportunities to acquire new centers. We do have confidence that we can get to our 250 million for 2015, we are at a 160 million at the end of the third quarter. And I guess our two acquisitions for the year highlight our platform and our ability to find assets where we feel we can either re-tenant, and create value from mark-to-market in rent or opportunities where we find redevelopment opportunities in new acquisitions. So I do think -- I guess we do have a redevelopment bucket lined up for the next 12 months and then it’s going to be somewhat short-term debt but we do feel that we are going to be out reinvest that over the next 12 months.
Operator: And the next question is from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: This is George [ph] on for Tayo. I understand the use of proceeds and the desire to a de-lever from asset sales. But I don’t know if I caught this earlier but how would you view also potentially repurchasing stock given kind of where the stock is trading relative NAV and kind of where it has traded and at a certain does it become attractive to actually do a share repurchase?
David Oakes: Yes, we are certainly open to it. We’ve discussed it at the management level; at the board level we have discussed it, even with shareholders at time. So far we believe we’ve taken the prudent first step which is raising capital through selling assets in a hotly priced private market. We have done a bit of that. There is considerably more under contract and we expect to be on the way. Over the next quarter or so and if the market stays as hot likely over the next year or so and naturally I think those proceeds to go to the pay down of debt but absolutely believe that that creates the capacity if we should continue to trade at a discounted private market value and extreme discount to peers that capital could certainly be used for share repurchase. So, nothing formal to announce today but certainly something that’s been discussed in advanced.
Operator: And the next question is from Alex Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill.
Alex Goldfarb: David, one of the things I think you guys have been vocal about delivering this year is laying out guidance range and then achieving that despite what’s going on, on the capital markets front. From your opening remarks, I just want to clarify and confirm while you are not giving ‘16 guidance, the intention is as you guys ramp up, continue to do dispositions, the focus is still going to be on growing earnings, not growing FFO for FFO sake like historic way back when but the point is that you guys will seek to deliver sort of a steady state earnings growth that investors can bank on while also doing the normal course dispositions. Is that the correct way that we should look for the 2016 guidance when it comes out?
David Oakes: Yes, obviously the formal press release with guidance and normal investor and analysts follow-up that we do will be in early January. But we do think today that despite the fact that our overwhelming focus is net asset value creation over time; and we do believe that asset sales in today’s environment are key to that that we should still be able to deliver earnings growth as we look out over the next year or next several years. So, I don’t think that’s growth for the sake of growth, I think that’s a testament to the strength of both the existing portfolio, strength of our ability to source some level of aftermarket opportunistically priced acquisitions and certainly mitigate it somewhat by what we think is a considerable opportunity to sell more assets than we buy in the current market.
Operator: And our next question is from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Just a couple of cleanup questions. Could you just describe the rent per square foot for the assets that you sold this quarter and the cap rates, if I missed it? And second, in terms of Puerto Rico, is there actually a healthy bid to sell those assets if you wanted to and at what point do you consider that as part of the overall pool of assets that you eventually want to sell from the portfolio?
Luke Petherbridge: Hi, Ki Bin; it’s Luke. So, I’ll handle the first part that, on transactions and hand over to Paul for Puerto Rico. With regards to the cap rate, it was a low to mid-7 for the quarter for Q3. However, looking forward, I think we are probably going to be in that range to sing contract, potentially even a little bidder. With regards to the ABR per square foot, it was probably a little lower in the main -- I think with low double digits compared to where we currently as our portfolio tracks, which is significantly above that more in the 14. So I think some of that 4% year-on-year has been driven not only by just the prior quarter but the year-to-date sales and the lower ABI that we are selling.
Paul Freddo: Yes, Ki Bin. This is Paul. On Puerto Rico, we are long-term holders and owners. And I think part of what’s missed as people talk about Puerto Rico is the event we’re having right now, right; it’s down, a significant down in the cycle but we’ve seen it before. I think the couple of deals I mentioned, Dave & Buster’s, H&M and there are others that we haven’t signed yet, so can’t announce. Retailers look at it the same way we do. This is a long-term strong retail market. And while we all are focused on the downs of today that is not how we are looking at and certainly not how the retail community is looking at it.
Operator: And next we have a question from Haendel St. Juste of Morgan Stanley.
Haendel St. Juste: So, another question on dispositions for you David here, obviously you guys have been very active in recent years. And I understand that you’ve changed the quality of what you are selling and are selling more opportunistically at this point. But I want to get some insight from you on the pulse on 10 [ph] of the transactions markets for what you are selling. Have you noticed any change in demand or pricing in recent months given tightening of the CMBS market transferring the late summer, early fall? And then also how does demand, the number of bidders and pricing say compared to maybe three, six months ago? Thanks.
Luke Petherbridge: Yes. Haendel, it’s Luke. So with regards to what we’re seeing, I don’t think we’re seeing any dramatic change. And I do acknowledge that overall borrowing rates and cost of capital has increased from three to six months ago. We sold out just from our recent issuance although not at the widest point in the market but clearly debt costs have increased. I think one thing that’s helped us is that the assets that we are selling are institutional, so institutional buyers are considerably more cash invested. So, the amount of leverage they made is a lot less. I do think we will start to see maybe some impact on that lower quality portfolios that have been traded where it is heavily driven by where CMBS pricing is or CMBS debt marks are. With regards to number of bidders, we continue to see and we do have a few things particularly with partners that are -- having looked at from our buyers, we continue to see a significant number of bidders underpaid due-diligence and bid on the assets. We continue to see more and more of the real estate advisory firms seeking to grow their platform and footprint and they have raised considerable amounts of capital over the last 12 to 18 months. And we continue see them focus on buying what we’d aim institutional quality but just not prime plus assets from DDR.
Operator: And the next question will come from Mike Mueller of JP Morgan.
Mike Mueller: Just quick clarification and then the question but when you are talking about being a net seller in terms of dispositions, is that a comment just on your portfolio before any JVs held with Blackstone or was that encompassing it?
Luke Petherbridge: Mike, I think that’s going to be both. I think DDR will be a net seller on a wholly owned basis for the year, and then when you add Blackstone will be a slightly larger net seller. Although DDR’s pro rata share of the Blackstone -- or the Blackstone sale of 230 million is only 5%. So, our pro rata share and the numbers we’re quoting is only $10 million.
Operator: And the next question is from Jim Sullivan of Cowen Group.
Jim Sullivan: Question for you David kind of a follow-on from the earlier question regarding share buyback and whether that’s kind of on the menu, things you might look at. Question I have is that with your commentary on cap rates today, I’m curious how you think about the margin and the value creation margin on your external investment, either in ground up development or perhaps value added acquisitions, take your choice? What do you think that value creation margin is, given where kind of terminal cap rates are and how you think about that as an alternative to share buybacks?
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, we certainly think quite a bit about that. It’s not just been the script but the focus on capital allocation is significant. And so it is a very regular exercise and extremely important to portfolio reviews but on a much more regular basis than that to say where should we be putting the next dollar or capital, does it go back to shareholders in one form or another, does it go into acquisitions, redevelopments, debt repayments, do we try to find new ground up opportunities. And so, it is a deep focus. I think different than a few years ago when we acknowledged one, there was a capital raising requirement associated with that, the sales and two, there was a need to clean up this portfolio. Today it’s focused on exactly where every dollar comes from, what that costs us and where that dollar goes, even to mid to small level leasing decisions that I think ended up resulting in higher net effective rents this quarter than we reported in a long period of time. And so I do think when we look at the overall scope of opportunities that while we can certainly say it is very aggressively priced transactions market that we do think we can find some value add acquisition opportunities. We have the team with making sure every deal that we buy is effectively a case study of how we can create value that it can become a slide in the investor presentation. Here’s how we bought Willowbrook in Houston and people dislike the overall market and when occupancy was 10 percentage points below what we thought we could achieve over time and then we need to execute on that or opportunities to grow within a certain submarket where we think we increase our pricing power, opportunities like the one in Philadelphia last year where we’re buying where we’ve got a tenant in our back pocket, so we’re simply underwriting the assets and the small amount of vacancy, very different than anyone else. And so I don’t think we want people to believe that there aren’t acquisition opportunities. We just believe that the disposition opportunity in today’s market is greater than the volume of acquisition opportunities. That’s different than only a few years ago where we were a significant net acquirer in a market that was priced very differently than the one today. And so I do think you’ll continue to see us buying some volume of attractive value add acquisition opportunities as that we talked about earlier to the portfolio review process certainly looking to backfill or even grow the redevelopment pipeline and believe that that will continue to be a very attractive use of capital. And then finally on the ground up development side as we complete these final two legacy projects, we certainly look around for other for other opportunities, but so far just haven’t found ones where the risk adjusted returns at all justify our capital. And so happy to say that we will continue to actively look there but can’t point to any additional activity on that from today.
Operator: The next question comes from Jason White of Green Street Advisors.
Jason White: Hey David, just going back to your previous comments, you talked about your development pipeline, if you will; you’re continuing to look for opportunities. It seems like a little bit of a change where before you were evaluating how you thought the development of the business and whether it was worthwhile to even have a development platform. Has that been a kind of changed attack or you can walk through the slightly change in message there over time?
David Oakes: I did not mean it to be a change in message. I think for us we absolutely believe having a development capacity is extremely important, whether it’s ground up or whether that’s reflected in constant, really seen in small scale and hopefully some larger scale redevelopment opportunity. And so I don’t think we’ve meant to downplay that. I think in some ways when we talk about the legacy development pipeline, we have clearly meant to downplay the returns associated with returning land, for too long a period of time and even the write-down on some of that land earlier this year but the overall capacity we believe to be critically important. But like with everything else, it’s returns driven business. And we will allocate capital where we think we can make the most money for shareholders. And so, it’s something where we don’t see great opportunity today but certainly not looking to downplay that capacity within DDR.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is James Sanders [ph] on for Rich. G&A was notably lower this quarter, is that due primarily to staff reduction? And if so what areas of business do you plan to scale back the most?
David Oakes: No, we not do the staff reductions. I think overall we identified early on opportunities to operate more efficiently. We’ve recognized those quickly. And you’ve see in the run rate recurring G&A I think changes that have been to be implemented pretty quickly and have been consistent this quarter to last quarter and certainly lower than last year. So, no staff cuts of no department. We’re being focused -- I think there’s a high level of excitement and encouragement to the employee base and from the employee base where we’re operating more efficiently, but not running around saying how much smaller does the team need to be. We’ve got an exceptional and deep team and we’re excited to keep them around, but to still be able to operate with a little greater level of efficiency and pass those savings through to bottom-line earnings and to shareholders.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Bilerman of Citi.
Michael Bilerman: Yes, I just want to make sure I got the trajectory right just in terms of asset sales as well as G&A. So just from a net sales perspective, Luke, I think you mentioned 90 million more of acquisitions that you have full confidence to close in the fourth quarter. And you announced a couple of weeks ago that you have $268 million, your share of assets to dispose. So, call it a negative 180 in the fourth quarter. And I think you guys have talked numerous times on the call now about being a net seller in ‘16. I just don’t know the magnitude. Is that 100 million, is it 250 million, because both would have a pretty dramatic effect on your -- and I respect the focus on NAV, but clearly from an earnings perspective as you pay down cheap debt would be quite dilutive? And then I think from a G&A perspective you are on the 70 million sort of run rate, if you are sort of done with all the efficiency saves, I assume now will be back to a more pressured labor type of cost and just continue now rise from this level on a more modest basis, again as we think about next year.
Luke Petherbridge: Absolutely Michael, I think the easy way to look at this year is if you look at the assets under contract and the ones that are sold year-to-date, I think we’re a little above 600 million. And if you assume we’re buying around 250 million, we are probably going to be a net seller in the magnitude of around 400 million for the year. Next year, I just want to highlight what David said in his comments and what I’ve outlined, it is truly opportunistic. So, if prices remain high, I think we will be net seller, however not to a smaller magnitude than what we are in 2015. What that number is? It’s hard to say. If we continue to see 10 to 20 credible bidders bidding on assets that we feel is being overpriced compared to our internal valuation and our return on capital, we will absolutely take advantage of that pricing changes. We may not be a large net seller at all looking into next year. So, I think where we sit now, we are comfortable and we have very clear visibility till the end of this year looking into next year. From a wholly-owned basis, it’s going to be driven by pricing with partners. And going back to your earlier question on Blackstone, clearly we do need to engage, and we are obviously always engaged with our partners looking over their portfolio. But there is a partner involved on when they choose to execute on dispositions. With regards to paying down low coupon debt, I just want to highlight that next year we do have 9.625% paper. I wouldn’t consider that low coupon for us. And I think we will be paying that down. So that significantly reduces the FFO dilution from any net dispositions. But I do believe as we focus on appropriate risk profile, paying down some element of debt with EBITDA growth will lower debt-to-EBITDA to the range which we are clearly trying to operate in which is a turn lower than where we are today. With regards to G&A, you are right, it’s probably in that low semis. I do think that there is a slight upward revision from that looking at in the future years. You did make a reference to labor cost, but I do think that will come up but it will be lower than what the historical run rate was at DDR.
Operator: And the next question is from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: Going back to the Blackstone partnership, I guess I was trying to understand, maybe you could give us some color on the dynamics underlying that and your options as it relates to the ROFO on the 10 assets and when you thought the term of that optionality would be. Is that something that is still many years out or is that something that’s going to be something that you guys are going to be looking to execute on over the next year or two?
Luke Petherbridge: Chris, with regard to the dynamic, I think the relationship remains very good. We continue to review transactions, new transactions and new investment opportunities with Blackstone but they have acknowledged and we have acknowledged that our portfolio and our focus on the quality of the real estate may some opportunities don’t fit our long-term strategy. With regard to the third joint venture, we do have a ROFO right of first offer on 10 of the assets which make up a considerable amount of the value of the portfolio. With regard to timing on that, it’s clearly going to be dependent on when we feel it’s appropriate for our cost of capital but also it’s up to when Blackstone deem that they want to exit and feel that they have the made returns that they warrant. So, they are investors. So, I do feel where we sit today, we are in a very good position to be able to acquiring a number of the assets that we feel would fit very well in our platform. And I don’t want to remind everyone that when we do that obviously the underwriting is extremely and we have de-risked that portfolio and the knowledge of the assets help us on reinvesting the capital. But right now, I would say it’s a few years out. Although the portfolio was acquired at an extremely attractive price looking at today’s market, the assets we sell which is the bottom tier is 20% above what we felt we acquired it for. We do feel like there is some additional portfolio pruning to do with Blackstone before we feel it makes sense to take Blackstone out.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. And the conference is also now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
31,SITC,4,2015,2016-02-12 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the DDR Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from President and CEO David Oakes, CFO and Treasurer Luke Petherbridge and Senior Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC, including our form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as amended. In addition we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available at our website at www.DDR.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions please rejoin the queue. At this time it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Given that we recently held our 2016 guidance call in January, I will keep my comments brief. As you know, our focus in 2015 was on three pillars, owning the best locations for the future of retail, allocating capital prudently and executing with a lower risk profile. I'm very pleased with our team's execution on each. To recap 2015 briefly, we grew FFO per share by 6%, grew our dividend by 11%, generated same-store NOI growth of 3.1% -- above our original range -- produced new leasing spreads of 22% and renewal spreads of 7% and made important strides culturally that we expect will flow through to outsized NAV and FFO growth for years to come. It's important to point out that these accomplishments came in the midst of a Management transition, highlighting the caliber of our senior leadership and the quality of the employees that I come to work with every day. Turning to our transactional progress, our portfolio evolution was dramatic in 2015. We heeded the signals from both the private and public markets and executed on $326 million of acquisitions and $569 million of dispositions at our share. The fruits of our transactional efforts through the years which include selling nearly 500 assets and acquiring over 200 assets since 2008, were on display in the fourth quarter operating results. Excluding Puerto Rico, same store NOI growth in the wholly-owned portfolio, a pool that makes up approximately 80% of our NOI, was 4.5% in the fourth quarter, highlighting the tremendous strength of our core business. Additionally, we grew average base rent per square foot for the portfolio by 4.1% year over year, the third consecutive year of growth above 4%. Interestingly, despite having the most aggressive transactional program in the peer group over the past few years, the nominal cap rate ascribed to our portfolio by the investment community has seemingly moved in lock step with our peer group, highlighting the lack of recognition for the progress made. While it is difficult to market the quality upgrades through dispositions versus acquisitions and shedding weaker assets is often out of favor in a bull market, we expect that our operating results and subsequent FFO and NAV growth will illustrate our upgrade over time. As you are aware, the beginning of the year is when we see the highest frequency of bankruptcies in retail. There are three primary reasons why we're not as concerned about pending bankruptcies relative to prior years. First, DDR's craft is leasing space. Since 2008 we have leased over 80 million square feet, including signing 544 new anchor leases and we will approach pending vacancies in the comparably aggressive fashion that we have historically. We budget for potential fallout within our guidance ranges and we market space well in advance of store closings. Second, the list of tenants looking for new space far exceeds those potentially closing stores and combined with a continued lack of material new supply for junior box space, positive absorption and favorable rent should not be an issue. Finally, as we move into this bankruptcy season, the quality of our NOI stream is on display. Over the past few years we have not only exited weak assets, but also a great deal of weak credits and the active management of our watch list has protected us from doing new deals with questionable tenants. As we look to the remainder of 2016, little has changed in terms of our operational or transactional expectations and as a result there are no changes to our previously disclosed guidance range. While the credit markets have been volatile over the past few months and some assets have seen a less significant number of bidders, we have not seen cap rates increase from what we're selling as the demand for assets remains strong and many of the buyers we're working with are not reliant on the high loan-to-value CMBS market. As such, we continue to believe that our disposition activity will be significant and weighted to the front half of the year. As I complete my first year as CEO of this Company, I'm proud of our organization's focus and progress throughout 2015. With that said, our team is well aware that expectations are even higher in 2016. Internal progress continues to exceed share price performance. However we have conviction in our strategy, our asset quality and our risk profile and we believe that the market will reward those companies who are most thoughtful about capital allocation over the long term. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks, David. Our team's focus on execution, our dramatic portfolio evolution and the current supply and demand dynamics allowed us to produce another consistently strong quarter and year in terms of operating results. In the fourth quarter we executed 290 new deals and renewals for over 2.5 million square feet. Deals spread for robust, with new deal spreads of 24.5% and renewal spreads of 7%; while same-store NOI came in at 3.4%, the highest in the last 12 quarters. Our full-year 2015 results were equally as impressive. New deal spreads were 22%, near all-time highs; we leased nearly 11 million square feet, the highest volume in our history; and we renewed 90% of all square footage rolling, also above our historical average of approximately 85%. For further detail behind our same-store NOI of 3.4% in the fourth quarter, our wholly-owned assets, excluding Puerto Rico, grew at 4.5%, a fantastic number for a portfolio that makes up 80% of our NOI. Leasing and minor redevelopment activity at some of our time, prime-plus and prime assets continues to drive this metric and the strong fourth quarter included activity at prime-plus assets such as Shoppers World in Boston, Midtown Miami and Woodfield Village in Chicago, all highly leased assets that we continue to grow. Our same-store performance is a testament to the strength and quality of our team and portfolio and we feel confident that our process for determining this figure is as indicative as any in the industry in terms of understanding the recurring NOI less major capital expenditures associated with a portfolio of high-quality power centers. Our pro rata leased rate improved 20 basis points sequentially and is flat year over year as we finish 2015 with a leased rate of 96%. Remaining flat year over year is in large part due to the continued sale of low-growth assets, with leased rates in the high 90% range and the acquisition of assets with some vacancy and significant growth potential. In the fourth quarter alone, we sold 2.2 million square feet with a leased rate of 98%. And during the full year we sold 6.2 million square feet with an average leased rate of 97%. These sales, in conjunction with our acquisitions, accounted for 10 basis points of pressure on the lease rate relative to year end 2014 and will translate into more of a growth runway, with fewer low and negative growth assets and an increased occupancy opportunity. I would also like to point out that we improved the small-shop leased rate for units under 5,000 square feet by 60 basis points, highlighting the strength in this category from national and regional players such as smaller fitness users, fast casual dining options and salons and service users, as well as mom and pops. As David mentioned, it is no secret that certain retailers are being mentioned as possible candidates for reorganization in 2016 and we're constantly asked whether these scenarios represent an opportunity or a concern. First, we look at the names being mentioned as reorganizations, not liquidations which is a significant difference. Second, as we have made dramatic improvement in the quality of our portfolio and the credit quality of our tenants, we definitely look at the possibility of replacing struggling retailers with best-in-class dynamic retailers as a clear opportunity not only to improve the rent paid on a given space, but to improve the terminal cap rates at which a given center would trade. Third, we watch all of our tenants' performance closely and are fully cognizant of and prepared for the space that we would get back. One very recent example of this is a Sports Authority that did not take its option in California in the first quarter. We have already agreed to economics with three high-quality national tenants in the 8000 to 14000 square foot range at a combined spread of 22% and an estimated net value creation after CapEx of $5.5 million. Clearly, retenanting boxes comes with downtime and capital, but as David also mentioned, this is our craft. And owning high-quality assets that will outperform as retail continues to evolve puts us in a position to take full advantage of these opportunities. To provide an update on Puerto Rico, I would like to share a few very important metrics regarding our portfolio on the island. In 2015, we generated over 400,000 square feet of total leasing activity in Puerto Rico and we continue to see reported sales on the island as relatively flat on a rolling 12-month basis. A couple of bright spots include traffic, that as many of you have observed remains consistently strong and historically low accounts receivable and bad debt. Same-store NOI was slightly negative in the fourth quarter and while this again highlights how strong the wholly-owned domestic assets are performing, we're cognizant of the distress on the island. The fact is, while the macro environment continues to struggle, there is still demand for new space in Puerto Rico and the consumer demand, coupled with the perpetual lack of competitive new supply, positions our assets well as the commonwealth further copes with problems that have existed for years. Finally, I would like to make a comment about all of the excitement and confusion in the press over Amazon's plans to open in brick-and-mortar locations. We, like others, have had conversations with Amazon to understand what their plans might be and how they might eventually fit into our constantly improving portfolio of assets. Without knowing exactly when, what and how many, the point is that they and other existing online and other yet unknown retail concepts will grow their brick-and-mortar presence and will want to do so in quality locations such as the locations we're focused on. And I will now turn the call over to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Thanks, mate. For the fourth quarter, operating FFO was $114.1 million or $0.31 per share. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $116.7 million or $0.32 per share. Non-operating items consisted primarily of transaction costs offset by asset sale gains. For the full year, operating FFO was $446.2 million or $1.23 per share which is a 6.1% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the year was $348.3 million or $0.96 per share. Non-operating items consisted primarily of non-cash impairments charges taken in the first quarter of 2015. It is worth noting that in the past five years DDR has been able to grow our FFO per share at a compound annual growth rate of more than 6%. This is despite selling nearly $4 billion of lower-quality assets, highlighting our ability to manage dilutive events. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of nine operating assets and three land parcels for $211 million at our share, bringing the full-year total to 66 operating assets and eight non-operating assets sold for $570 million at our share. Pricing within our asset class remains at historic high levels and we have leveraged this environment to opportunistically sell the bottom tier of our portfolio at an average cap rate of 7.2%. As outlined by David, we acknowledge the impact these dispositions have on our short term performance, but we absolutely feel this is the right step in the current market conditions which will materially improve our Company's forward-looking earnings growth while reducing downside earnings risk. The assets sold in 2015 were over 96% leased and were underwritten to grow at less than 2% over the coming years. Additionally, the sale of these assets eliminated over 20 boxes which re-leased to watch list tenants which will further reduce retail full impact to our earnings. For example, recent assets sold like Home Depot Center, 150,000 square foot center in Chicago with five-year NOI growth profile of 1.7%, for a mid 6% cap rate. Notwithstanding, our dispositions have dominated the volume of transactions in 2015 and into the first half of this year, our talented transaction team continued to source and review opportunities to deploy capital into new opportunities where we feel our operating platform can achieve creative returns. In the fourth quarter we closed on the acquisition of seven assets for $166 million at our share, bringing the full-year total to 10 shopping centers and three out parcels acquired for $330 million. Six of the seven properties acquired in fourth quarter were purchased in conjunction with Blackstone for $13 million at our 5% share and carried an $83 million preferred equity component with an 8.5% annual return. Our joint venture platform remains a prudent low-risk avenue for acquiring high-quality dirt at off market pricing and allows DDR the opportunity to acquire assets at attractive pricing. The transaction differs slightly from our prior deals with Blackstone, as we only took in equity interest in the higher quality assets that we have a right of first offer on. These centers are located in Long Island, Philadelphia, Miami and Orlando. We're confident in our ability to accretively replace upper third equity position with NOI from acquisitions or with additional preferred equity, as our existing joint ventures with Blackstone are wound down gradually in the coming years. We also acquired Millennium Plaza in the four quarter, a 400,000 square foot power center located in Orlando and anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, BJ's Wholesale Club, The Home Depot and Ross Dress For Less. This acquisition elevates Orlando to the Company's sixth largest market by pro rata base rent and significantly increased our presence in the Mall of Millennia retail corridor, where we now own three centers, all acquired in the last year and have become the dominant open-air landlord in the sub-market. The strong demand for our property type has allowed us to close 2015 as a net seller by approximately $250 million. As we discussed in our guidance call in January, we're also projecting to net sale approximately $450 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. To that point, in the first quarter this year we have sold 14 of the 17 operating assets that were under contract for sale, totaling $195 million at our share and have 4 assets still under contract for sale and 21 under agreement, highlighting our commitment to the final legs of the portfolio upgrade and take advantage of the continued strength of the transactional market for institutional-quality assets. I would like to highlight that DDR trades at an implied cap rate comparable to where we're selling our lowest quality assets, approximately 80 basis points outside our shopping center peers. This is the same relative bifurcation the stock experienced in 2010 and 2011 prior to DDR selling an additional 280 assets. On the capital market side, we issued $400 million of 10-year unsecured notes in October at a 4.25% coupon, marking our 10th unsecured issuance since 2009 and our continued attractive access to the bond market. The proceeds were used to repay the $350 million of convertible notes that were due in November which carried a GAAP interest rate of 5.25% and a cash interest rate of 1.75%. We have $350 million of secured and unsecured debt maturing in 2016 at a weighted average interest rate of 7.8% and we intend to accretively repay all maturities with disposition proceeds and at this point do not intend to access the capital markets in 2016. Our 2016 maturities consist of $240 million of seven-year unsecured debt that was issued in 2009 and carries an interest rate of 9 5/8% which will be fully retired in March. Following the repayment of all 2016 maturities, DDR's consolidated debt tier ratio will be the longest on record since 2005 and represents our desire for a comprehensive lack of funding risk. Finally, expected asset sales proceeds will be used to retire maturing debt and reduce our consolidated debt to EBITDA by approximately 0.5 to 0.8 times by year end 2016. The growing size of our unencumbered pool, our exposure to floating-rate debt and ample access to liquidity through our asset sale proceeds, have dramatically reduced our risk profile and put our balance sheet in a position to outperform in all market cycles. With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: David, could you talk little bit about your same-store NOI? And how much impact does bad debt make a dent to the 3.4% reported same-store NOI growth? And if you included your bad debt reserve into your 2016 same-store NOI guidance, what would that 2.5% to 3.5% guidance look like?
David Oakes: One of our policies associated with same-store NOI that really tries to accomplish that goal of that number answering the question how is this portfolio growing this quarter year-over-year, is the items that do have multi-year impact are not included in same-store NOI. So bad debt would be one of those items, because often times you could have two years of accrued accounts receivable that were booked as income all get written off in one quarter. So you effectively captured all of that in one period of time as opposed to truly saying what is the portfolio doing this quarter, this year versus last year. We calculate and follow closely the bad debt numbers; they were actually down a little bit in 2015. And so effectively if we included them it would have helped the number a little bit in 2015. We budget them to be a little bit higher in 2016. And so if we did include them in 2016, it would take that same store NOI a little bit lower. But overall bad debt remains very low which we think is a positive sign for what we're seeing in the retail environment. And like I said, if we did include it for 2015 which has always been our policy to exclude it from the same-store NOI calculation, it would have been slightly beneficial to our reported results.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Just with regards to development and redevelopment, as you deliver on some big projects in 2016, are there any large projects that you expect to start this year? Just wondering how to think about 2017 and beyond external growth and how you're thinking about new projects and major capital commitments as we enter a more uncertain retail environment?
Paul Freddo: One of the things we're showing in the sup these days is real projects. There are other projects, as you point out, that will be started and will be later, out year completions. We're really going to focus on and I will start with redevelopment. There's a large handful of some of our larger and better assets that we've got some plans. But we're going to include them when they are real. And steer away from a large -- a big number out there with a program of $1 billion or multiple billions over several years. We want to be real in the sup about what's deliverable and when we're going to deliver it. There other things that don't show that will show in future quarters; that will be second phases of projects, Lee Vista will be one. Belgate we're commencing a second phase that we will spell out in future quarters. The second phase down in Kyle which is an Austin market where we had a development several years ago, we think will kick off a second phase either late this year or in 2017 for probably an 2018 completion. Again, the focus within the sup is to be more real in terms of what we're showing you guys as real projects and when they'll be delivered and exactly what those costs are going to look like. But there is clearly a pipeline. The other thing to remember is we talk about development as -- that we're clearly taking a much more thoughtful approach to how we look at the pipeline, what we're going to deal with. We see quite a number of projects that are presented to us as possibilities. We've repeated this quarter after quarter, we're not going to get into long term entitlement processes. We're going to look at projects that we know we can deliver in a one to three-year horizon. And again, the focus is going to be on what's real. I'm not concerned about a lack of pipeline because there is plenty out there for us to do. It's just going to be a much more thoughtful approach and you're going to see what's real and what we can deliver.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Leasing spreads in the fourth quarter were strong. We've seen that across the strip space for the most part this quarter. Have discussions changed at all with retailers of the last 30 to 45 days or so? Do you think we should expect to see leasing activity moderate a bit throughout the year if broader economic conditions do not improve?
Paul Freddo: No, Todd. The conversations have continued to change in our favor, if you will. We continue to see rents growing. I don't see any slowdown in that. One of the things that came out of New York in consistent conversations post-holiday sales is the retailers that are growing market share are not pulling back on their growth plans. That's consistent with the retailers we're focused on. You hear us talk about the winners which are clearly in the value and the off-price play and we feel very good about where they sit in this environment. We feel very good about their continued growth plans and I don't expect any change in the near term in that conversation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz of UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: David, in your opening comments you mentioned not seen any moving cap rates for the secondary or even call it non-core assets here you're selling yet. Buyer pools are thinning and it feels at least anecdotally that pricing is set to move at the disruption in the capital markets. I'm wondering if that's at all weighing on your thinking and encouraging you at all to try to push some of these transactions to happen sooner before maybe the market does move, even if you have to compromise in pricing a bit?
David Oakes: Jeremy, I think you raised some good points. We certainly did want to be up front with the comment that we're seeing buyer pools a little bit smaller, but tried to make the point that this is going from a very significant number of buyers to a still significant number of buyers. So directionally I get what you're asking about and the way you're thinking about it, but we still are seeing a significant enough amount of demand, a significant enough amount of equity that is funding that where we haven't seen things change. In fact on the other side even if spreads had been more volatile, obviously treasury rates going lower, so some things that do continue to encourage buyers. And so we're not seeing a significant change there at all. But on the other side, I think we've outlined some important plans to complete the last stage of the asset sale process and get that stuff done. And now that we've made those decisions, we just see no reason to wait. And so it's not a notion of compromise on price to emphasize timing, strategically we've made this decision to do this, we've presented it as part guidance. And so we think it's prudent to execute as soon as possible on what we've outlined. Hopefully it's more a signal of that than any sort of true deterioration that we're forecasting in the next several quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: First, wrapping up a chapter there with the sale of Paseo Colorado. It was last of the Trizec mixed-use projects. Question for Paul on your Amazon comments. As you speak to different internet retailers who are looking at bricks and mortar strategies, are they open, a blank canvas as far as what retail format they look at, whether it's malls, grocery anchored shopping centers or power centers? Or when you start conversations with them most of them have sort of a preconceived notion of what format they want to be in?
Paul Freddo: It's early on in that whole conversation, Alex. I will tell you some of them and Warby Parker and Bonobos are two examples, -- these guys are going to start with street retail in some of the sexiest markets in the country. It's really how does it grow from there? Where do they go from there? There is no preconceived do they move to a mall, do they move to great power centers? There is a possibility. Amazon is a different story. This conversation about the bookstores clearly fit right into our product type and property type. I don't want to speak for other calls, but the point that was trying to be made was they are going to grow and they're going to grow significantly and it's going to be over time and they are going to pick quality locations. And if you own quality locations they're going to be in it. So right now I would tell you, simple comment is that on the Amazon piece we're quite confident that when -- and that is a big unknown as to when they eventually roll out some kind of bookstore program, they're going to be looking at power centers as well as some of the better mall properties in the country. The other guys, it's going to start with the street retail and you will see it grow from there. Alex, I don't want to lose -- anybody to lose the focus on the fact that what we're seeing with the existing retailers in place too. As these guys become more and more of a power and a presence in that whole multi- and omni-channel world, that's today and for the next couple years what I see is the much greater focus. How are our retailers successful, best-in-class retailers driving that business and what are they doing to compete in that online format?
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: This is George on for Tayo. A couple of questions, I guess first on Puerto Rico, if you could just give a little more color into the slight negative same-store NOI? Is that more occupancy or rate driven? And then also what are releasing and spreads looking like in Puerto Rico?
Paul Freddo: I'll start with the last bit, George. The spreads are just like I say low single digit, but we're seeing some positive spreads on the releasing across the deals we've made over the year end and in the fourth quarter. The same story -- we had a couple of Kmart's leave during the year and as we've mentioned on prior calls we obviously believe those created an opportunity well below market. Low rents, but significant impact late in the year and in the fourth quarter. So spreads I would say certainly lower than the overall portfolio, but again, flat to slightly positive. And lease rate was pretty consistent between quarters, Q3 to Q4. Don't see that going much lower, so we should grow back. But again I think the Kmarts are probably the biggest impact on same store.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Paul, this is for you. Could you please comment on the off-price retailer growth, in particular TJ Maxx which is our largest tenant and Ross? They're almost in one-third of your centers I believe now. How does that impact the overall retail market in your view on the shopper's preference for your centers with those tenants relative to maybe traditional outlets?
Paul Freddo: First of all the two names you mentioned, TJ with their various concepts and Ross, aren't outlet retailers. They are typical power center, strip center retailers who are fantastic. So I'll start with their growth. They both continue to want to grow in that 100 store per year range which is just an incredible number because this is a number that have been achieving for the last several years. Another thing worth pointing out about those guys and I'm emphasizing this because quite frankly I like to brag about them and our emphasis on retailers such as TJ and Ross, these are guys who led in results going into the recession, during the recession and in the many years since the recession which is an incredible consistent story and goes well beyond something that just only plays when everybody is feeling down. It's not something you see in any other sectors. Start with the luxury sector which obviously is going to have big swings up and down. We're seeing it in the department stores. The department store model is a very difficult one. Those are not guys we're focused on. We're focused on the retailers you are talking about. Their performance has been incredibly consistent, they want to grow in a big way. They want to continue to take market share in a big way and we're confident they will. I don't see it as any overlap with traditional outlet centers. The excitement of the merchandise offering, the different merchandise offering that can be in a TJ Maxx at any one time, it drives traffic and it drives excitement with the consumer. I see nothing but continued upside and growth for those off-price and value retailers. Another thing I think is worth thinking about is how we see other retailers continue to go after that business. Not that Nordstrom Rack is new to it at all, but very successful with that division of Nordstrom. You have Macy's with Backstage and Lord and Taylor now. Others see the success and just not the short term success but the longer term sustainable success of TJ and Ross and are going after that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Carol Kemple: In your centers what retailers are you seeing that want to expand besides your off-price value retailers?
Paul Freddo: Bed Bath and Beyond is one that is clearly expanding. Dick's Sporting Goods in a big way with a couple different divisions, with their Dick's Sporting Goods and their Field & Stream. Those are couple of the retailers that we see are always looking to grow.
Carol Kemple: Okay. And then in the last five years have you seen any kind of significant shift between the amount of physical retailers in your shopping centers and the service retailers, whether it be like a Drybar or a Massage Envy? Or would you say the percentage is about the same?
Paul Freddo: I would say the percentage is the same. In our best power centers you don't see a big component that's in that category you mentioned, whether it's service or some of the food and beverage. In the grocery anchor there's a little more of that, but percentages haven't changed over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Just taking a look at the sup at the redevelopments and can you walk through what exactly causes a project to fall into the major redevelopment bucket versus the minor bucket? And how much of the minor deliveries do you expect to come online in 2016?
Paul Freddo: We don't have a cut and dry rule on it, Mike, but it's usually about $10 million. Typically includes additional GLA for the project. It's a little bit of feel and that's one of the reasons we're going to spell them out and you're not going to see a long, long list of majors. There will be others coming to the list and you'll recognize the centers are some of our best centers as we refine our plans and think through exactly how much we're going to spend and when we're going to deliver. On the minor, I don't want to wing this too much, but it's going to be somewhere in I think about the $90 million -- somewhere in that $80 million to $90 million range for deliveries. We expect a run rate, Mike, of right at about $100 million, maybe a little north of that in any given year in terms of CIP. But in terms of deliveries this year it will be somewhere in that $80 million to $90 million range.
Luke Petherbridge: Mike, probably the other thing to note is we did update our disclosure earlier this year -- or last year to break out the redevelopments to major and minor. Clearly major is not in our same store and that is the main reason we put that in there. And then minor is going to have a significant number of projects that come in and out. The one coming out this quarter was part of Seabrook which is our New Hampshire development.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: Just a follow-up question actually on the last one which is as it relates to the process by which you take something that's in the shadow and move it to the supplement, are there specific rules or milestones that have to be achieved? Or is it more of a feel process?
Paul Freddo: In terms of what's brought to the sup, that's not a feel. That's when we think a project is real and we've thought through and we've got a pretty accurate understanding of what the spend is going to be and when we're going to bring it online, Chris. So again, what we wanted to get away from was just putting out a big bold number that we're going to deliver X in the next few years something that never seems to be terribly accountable and is all over the place in our industry. This is going to be something where you're going to see real projects move in and you'll see them move out when there are delivered and put into service. But what moves into the sup and out of the sup, certainly it's not a feel, that's just real stuff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Just a couple quick ones, did you already talk about what motivated you to sell Paseo Colorado, a major redevelopment project before it was completed? And the second question, with some of the news that happened this week on same-store NOI accounting, just curious if that prompted any kind of internal discussion -- new internal discussions with the Management team or Board members on how you report that number at all?
Luke Petherbridge: So on Paseo that was a 550,000 square foot class A lifestyle center which we acquired in the early 2000s. It's located in Pasadena. Basically that is a project we have been working on for the better part of a decade, but more recently over the last couple of years we have had significant leasing momentum there. We started what would have been a significant redevelopment, probably one of the largest in the Company's history. We were approached off market by the buyer and we felt that the price that they offered gave us the majority of the gain which we felt we would realize through the redevelopment today and obviously remove a significant amount of risk from our development pipeline going forward. It had a huge component, probably one-third of the spend was in residential or condos. So we just felt that the price offered was in line with class A mall pricing and we were able to realize the gain which we felt we were going to get over the probably the next two to three years or more today. So we thought it was a prudent decision from a risk point of view.
David Oakes: On same-store NOI, we've had a consistent process for years. We even outlined specifically in that back section of our supplemental with major accounting policies, we outlined the mindset and some of the specifics regarding same-store NOI. We have dedicated personnel that spend a considerable amount of time post quarter close working on that calculation. We have oversight from our internal audit group and so it is a number that we have been very focused on for a long period of time and believe we've calculated consistently and believe we're well positioned on a go-forward basis. We've lived through quarters like the first quarter of this year where some one-time snow removal expenses or just some seasonal expenses impacted that result lower and we dealt with reporting a quarter that was lower than our expectation at times. And this quarter at the end of the year coming in very strong; and so we've dealt with the reality of what the results provided. We have obviously been even more focused on it given the events of the past week. We had our Board meeting earlier this week, we had our audit committee meeting earlier this week, we've had a good discussion with those groups and I think everyone here is comfortable with the way we have calculated it and the way that we expect to calculate it going forward. I think you have been very much at the forefront of trying to make those numbers comparable between companies and calling out surprises or inconsistencies when you saw them and we really have tried to make this number as much as possible the right answer to how the assets are growing on a year-over-year basis. So I think we will continue with that process, we will continue to exclude major redevelopment activity that we think does not represent same store. And so it's been a focus and I think it continues to be the one that we think our process works and we're not inclined to change it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Thinking about acquisitions, those assets that you are interested in acquiring, are the bidders similar in size, were they worse versus maybe 9 or 12 months ago? And what is the composition of those bidders?
Luke Petherbridge: Craig, the answer to that is for the stuff we're looking to buy, so prime plus power centers, the composition really hasn't changed. I think David made a -- we answered a question earlier and made some comments about with the recent debt changes has that altered pricing? I think you may start to see that in non-institutional, non-prime assets. We're not seeing that on the stuff we're selling. So I think we're selling institutional assets, but even taking that to the other extreme, I think the high quality assets that we consider would be a good fit for our platform are still remaining extremely competitively bid by whether it's public rates -- and but more so it's private money, whether it's pension funds or sovereigns or asset allocations. I think advisors, they are still a significant force in the acquisition side. They still have a significant amount of capital to place. We don't envisage that coming off at all in the near term. However, we do think we're able to probably find a couple hundred million of acquisitions this year. Whether it's off market or whether it's using our platform, we feel we're going to be able to achieve a better return on our equity. But the acquisition side for prime and prime plus assets remains extremely difficult.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: Just a question on Sports Authority, in terms of the 2015 or 2016 locations and the portfolios, on average are there in place rents above or below market? And if you can provide any overall color on the quality of the centers they're in, that would be great.
David Oakes: George, on average clearly below, I would say some are probably at market. But the better point to make on the Sports Authority portfolio, they are in some of our best assets. Just rattling off a few, Midtown Miami, Shoppers World in Framingham, Perimeter Point in Atlanta come to mind. These are all locations we'd absolutely love to get back. It's also worth noting a couple are back, so the number -- like the one I referenced in California where we've already made deals to retenant the space quickly which speaks to the fact that we're way out in front. We have a very good feel as to which locations we would get back if any upon filing and a great working relationship with those guys. So we have a real good idea of what works and doesn't work for Sports Authority. But bottom line, they are in great locations, for the most part they are below market and they are a retailer in these locations that we would love to replace with a strong and long list of quality retailers who are looking for the space, including specialty grocers and others in these locations.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. This also concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect. Have a great day."
32,SITC,1,2016,2016-04-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Welcome to the DDR Corp First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call will you hear from President and CEO, David Oakes, CFO and Treasurer, Luke Petherbridge and Senior Executive President of Leasing and Development, Paul Freddo. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC. Including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO and operating FFO. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call, in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Oakes.
David Oakes: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I will start by addressing last night's announcement that Luke Petherbridge will be departing. First, I would like to congratulate Luke on his new role. While I'm clearly disappointed about his departure from DDR, I'm proud that after working closely with Luke for eight years he has taken an exceptional opportunity to work with our Partner Blackstone as CEO of their growing retail platform. Luke helped transform our balance sheet, our portfolio and our culture and I appreciate all that he has done for this firm. Looking forward, I'm confident that there will be a seamless transition from Luke to his successor in the near term and that our capital markets and transactions teams are well positioned to continue the strong performance that they have achieved over the past few years with a new leader. As we noted frequently in our annual report, our team has never been more focused and the change in leadership serves much more as a healthy challenge and opportunity for our employees than a hindrance. Turning to the quarter, I'm incredibly pleased with our operating results and progress on the portfolio and balance sheet. Notably, our same-store NOI growth of 3.4% is a testament to the heavy lifting that has been achieved through the years and the percentage of NOI in the pool has increased to 92%, the highest figure in recent Company history which highlights the authenticity of the calculation. While it is difficult to give credit in the public market for upgrading quality of the portfolio through dispositions, our sale of over 500 assets is yielding impressive results. We have spent a disproportionate amount of time finely tuning this portfolio into the highest caliber subset of large format shipping centers with the best credit profile and most promising growth prospects in the sector. As a result and Paul will elaborate further, I'm pleased to report that the wholly-owned portfolio, outside of Puerto Rico and exclusive of major redevelopment activity, grew in excess of 4% in the first quarter, highlighting the growth opportunities associated with this platform. To this end, we feel very comfortable with our previously stated full-year same-store NOI guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5%. While recent bankruptcies do put pressure on this figure, this was incorporated in the low end of guidance range and we continue to project that our portfolio, inclusive of regular bankruptcies, will perform well within this range. Given the operational performance as well as the transactional efforts to date, we have decided to raise our operating FFO guidance range to $1.20 to $1.25 per share. Next, I would like to update you on transactional progress. As we announced in the first quarter transactional release a few weeks ago, we're well on our way to meeting our originally stated guidance of $600 million to $800 million of dispositions. While the capital and transaction markets have seen some volatility, our buyer pool remains credible, we see minimal financing issues and we continue to move forward with our originally announced volume and dispositions. While the transactions are a work in progress, I look forward to dialogue with shareholders in the coming quarters regarding the progress that we have made in transforming this portfolio. We would expect that as a very long road of significant sales comes to an end in the coming quarters, the investor and analyst communities will take a fresh look at DDR's wholly-owned portfolio or 93% of NOI. Not simply by demographics or supplemental statistics, but by engaging in the primary research associated with determining what the private market would actually pay for this portfolio, while we're confident that this will translate into nominal cap rate compression used in valuations, notably on a relative basis. We expect that it should also translate into earnings and same-store NOI growth going forward. As a follow-up to the discussion on transactional activity, I would like to briefly discuss our continued focus on the balance sheet. As you can in our first quarter supplemental, we made significant progress over the past year on leverage reduction by reducing debt to EBITDA by 0.3 times. As we stated in our initial guidance release, we're committed to a reduction further from the 6.9 times reported this quarter to a figure in the mid 6 times by year end, as the vast majority of sale proceeds should be used for debt repayment. If the proper multiple is used on our EBITDA stream relative to peers, especially given our non-core rationalization, our leverage profile would be even more attractive than a simple debt to EBITDA calculation would indicate. There are few final items I would like to address. The first is corporate governance. While we have received our fair share of questions regarding our proxy filing, I want the investment community to know that both myself and our Board are as committed as ever to creating long term shareholder value. Unlike most of the peer group, we continue to be compensated predominantly on relative and absolute shareholder return, not within the FFO growth, allowing to us make long term decisions that do not sacrifice the portfolio or balance sheet. Additionally, I would like to point out that Tom August, the highly respected and successful former REIT executive is standing for election at the upcoming shareholder meeting. Tom brings a wealth of real estate knowledge and highly coveted public market experience that we believe will help guide us going forward. The final subject I would like to comment on is the perception of our Firm and how we view the profile of this Company going forward. DDR has endured nearly a decade of transition since the financial crisis. This transition is not lost on management. We do not view today's announcement of Luke's departure as a perpetuation of the situation but instead it's more as an opportunistic endeavor for a talented individual. Both management and the Board's goal is to conclude this long transition phase. The portfolio balance sheet growth profile and team here are well positioned for a long tenure to create value over many cycles. I will now turn the call over to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks, David. Leasing fundamentals and overall operating performance remained strong during the first quarter, as we produced solid results across the portfolio. Our leased rate increased 10 basis points quarter over quarter to 96.1% at our pro rata share and is up 30 basis points year over year. More importantly, we continue to deliver strong same-store NOI results as we achieved 3.4% growth at our pro rata share and excluding Puerto Rico, 4.2% growth at our pro rata share. This same-store NOI strength was driven primarily by re-leasing below market anchors, minor redevelopments at prime plus wholly-owned assets. As well as a decrease in operating expenses, the majority of which was driven by a pickup due to prior year snow related expenses. Slightly offsetting same-store NOI growth for the quarter was the impact from Puerto Rico which represented an 80 basis point drag and is included in the 3.4% figure. Overall deal volume remained strong and we executed 301 new deals and renewals for 1.9 million square feet in the quarter. Spreads were again strong, with a pro rata new deal spread of 19.5%, a pro rata renewal spread of 8.7% and a combined spread of 10.7%, representing the highest combined spread in five quarters. Lease renewals were especially strong in quarter, as evidenced by the 8.7% spread and they also continue to drive same-store NOI growth. For starters, of the 4.4 million square feet of leases with expiration dates in the first quarter, 89% of tenants on a square footage basis renewed their leases, achieving yet another quarter of tenant retention above our historical average of roughly 85%, highlighting the strength of the transformed portfolio. During the quarter, we negotiated a package renewal with Barnes & Noble covering nine locations, achieving a renewal comp of 16.3%. The Barnes leases were naked with no options as a result of concessions granted early in the recession, whereby we eliminated options and gained near term control, putting us in a position to mark rents to market with little investment. The benefit of this renewal package will have a positive impact on same-store NOI that will be realized throughout the next three years. New deal metrics were also strong in the quarter. For example, at Meridian Crossroads, we recovered a Babies R Us box at the expiration of their ground lease that was paying $3 per square foot. Not only did we reduce our exposure to a troubled credit, we added a strong merchant in Cost Plus at an over four times mark up in rent. We have 12,000 square feet of residual space in the Babies box to work with and we're in active conversations with other best-in-class national retailers to fill this space. I would also like to take a moment to address leasing progress made in the small shop category. In the first quarter, we executed a total of 88 new deals for 178,000 square feet for space less than 5,000 square feet and year over year, our leased rate for this category within our wholly-owned portfolio is up 170 basis points to 87.7%. Small-shop leasing tends to get marginalized due to breadth of box space within our portfolio. But it will continue to be a key component for driving further same-store NOI growth, as national retailers as well as strong regional operators and local mom-and-pops seek quality shop space. It is also worth noting that we continue to push for and achieve 3% rent bumps on the vast majority of shop deals as a way to lock in future same-store growth. And finally regarding our first quarter deals, as I mentioned, deal economics are a keen focus of ours and this is supported by our net effective rents for the quarter. Our net effective rents of $15.62 per square foot for new deals and $15.88 for renewals, compare very favorably with our average net effective rents in 2015 of $14.08 for new deals and $14.27 for renewals. I would now like to briefly comment on the topic of redevelopment and development. On the redevelopment front, while we sold For Sale Colorado, our pool of redevelopment projects and our desire to drive NAV growth through our operational expertise is by no means shrinking. We have a significant redevelopment pipeline of major projects, including approximately $250 million currently in process and another $250 million we're currently working through entitlements and pre-leasing on. While we do take a cautious view on CIP as a percentage of the Company and we do perform vigorous underwriting, our desire to grow organically with $100 million to $150 million of redevelopment spend annually is as strong as ever. With regards to development, we held a grand opening of Lee Vista Promenade on March 24. And at the conclusion of the second quarter, ground-up development of Legacy Land Holdings, excluding future expansions, will officially be complete. Located just north of Orlando International Airport, Lee Vista opened strong and retailers are meeting and exceeding sales projections. More importantly, this marks the completion of the legacy pipeline which has been a drag on FFO and NAV growth for years and has significantly hindered balance sheet progress. As you are aware, a handful of retailers continue to struggle to win consumer dollars and Sports Authority's bankruptcy filing highlighted this competitive battle. Our national accounts team is working very closely with Sports Authority's consultants and we should have more clarity on the direction the bankruptcy will take within the next month or so. We're planning for a worst-case scenario and aggressively marketing the space. To that end, we did incur a bad debt expense related to Sports Authority of $500,000 in the first quarter. However, that bad debt did not show up in same-store NOI, given our policy of excluding it from that calculation. Additionally, we did not reserve for the majority of March rent from Sports Authority. As our analysis of the amounts that were attributable to the March period after the filing or post-petition accounts receivable, revealed that we will likely have a claim to collect March rent in the event of a liquidation and settlement. If we were to deduct that rent from same-store NOI, the impact would have been a 30-basis-point detriment to our actual 3.4% figure. Further, please keep in mind that in these situations, retailers can bid on the existing Sports Authority leases and we're keeping a close eye on this activity as well as staying on top of any recapture opportunities that may be worth pursuing. We obviously have the Sports Authority on our watch list and have been monitoring their performance for some time, having signed our last new deal with them in 2010. All 12 wholly-owned locations are in prime plus or prime centers which is indicative of the quality of space where Sports Authority occupies in our portfolio and the positive outlook for re-leasing to best-in-class retailers. I would additionally like to provide an update on Anna's Linens, as many of you have inquired about leasing progress for this space. Of the 11 domestic Anna's we had in our portfolio, all were in prime plus or prime locations. We have executed three deals and are in lease negotiations for an additional two locations with rent comps in the low 20% range. Within our wholly-owned portfolio, the average rent comp has been 42%. We're seeing demand for this space from national tenants including Ulta, Five Below, Carters, Oshkosh and Skechers, as well as strong regional operators looking to expand. The bottom line is that we have dramatically improved the quality of portfolio and the credit quality of our tenants and we view the possibility of replacing struggling retailers with best-in-class dynamic retailers as a real opportunity. We watch all of our tenants' performances extremely closely and work diligently to stay ahead of the curve in terms of retenanting space. Puerto Rico continues to receive a considerable share of media attention, most of which is directed toward macroeconomic uncertainty and instability. For those who have been on property tours or follow us on Twitter, you are aware that consumer traffic in our centers is resilient and parking lots are near full capacity on a daily basis. In fact, we have added a link to the home page of our website for you to view the traffic at Plaza Del Sol. Overall sales on the island are stabilizing and Wal-Mart experienced a positive 1% sales increase for 2015. While same-store NOI was down 1.5% for the first quarter, we expect it to turn positive in the back half of the year as H&M opens at Plaza Del Sol and we comp a difficult back half in 2015. We have previously mentioned the new deals with H&M, Dave & Buster's and Outback Steakhouse as examples of retailers understanding the great long term opportunity that opening stores in Puerto Rico provides. And we will continue to execute on the leasing front and weather any headwinds encountered. Before turning the call over to Luke, I would like to comment on RECon which is less than one month away. Our focus continues to be on the consistent qualitative and quantitative improvement of our assets. While the leasing environment continues to be strong, we intend to take full advantage of this opportunity. As usual, we have a full slate of meetings scheduled and we look forward to seeing our retail Partners and members of the investment community. We will be located at the Bellagio again this year and please keep in mind that our space will be open on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. We look forward to seeing you all there. Now I will turn the call over to Luke.
Luke Petherbridge: Cheers mate. For the first quarter, operating FFO was $114.2 million or $31 per share which is a 6.6% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $114.5 million, also $0.31 per share. Non-operating items consisted of $314,000 of transaction costs. During the first quarter, we closed on the sale of 16 operating assets and 3 land parcels for $224 million at our share. Included in this was the sale For Sale Colorado, a large style center in Pasadena for $132 million which was the largest single asset transaction in the Company's history and represented what DDR felt was full valued for a complicated in-process multi-use redevelopment project. Inclusive of the first quarter, we continue to project asset sales in the low 7% cap rate for the full year. We currently have 21 operating assets and 9 land parcels under agreement for over $500 million at our share, the majority of which is expected to close at the end of the second quarter or at the beginning of the third quarter. Given the transactional progress to date, we still expect to meet the high end of our guidance range of $600 million to $800 million of asset sales. Increasing expected net asset sales from $450 million to $550 million weighted in the first half of this year which will complete the final legs of our portfolio evolution. Following these potential sales, DDR should return to a normalized rate of purely opportunistic transactional activity for the second half of 2016. Select proceeds from the first quarter sales were deployed into the acquisition of Palm Valley Pavilions West, a 277,000 square foot tower center located in Phoenix, Arizona for $61 million at a cap rate in the low 6%s. Palm Valley is DDR's 7th asset in the Phoenix MSA and elevates Phoenix to our fourth largest MSA rank by NOI and positions DDR to truly leverage its scale in that market where we have one of our regional offices. The remainder of the sale proceeds paid down debt, including $240 million of our 9 5/8% seven-year unsecured bonds that were repaid in March upon maturity. The use of proceeds should further reduce leverage and lower our debt to EBITDA by 0.5 to 0.8 of turn by year end, including the repayment of the remaining $137 million of 2016 maturities. This will leave no need to access capital markets in 2016. Though additional opportunities should allow the Company to meet its acquisition guidance of $250 million, we acknowledge the impact of net disposition activity has on short term earnings and growth. And we feel the associated reduction in debt to EBITDA is the final major de-risking effort needed to maintain an attractive credit metrics over the course of all economic cycles. I would like to address the outlook of our commingled joint venture, the DDR Domestic Retail Fund. We have a 20% interest in the 55 assets held in the fund which was established in 2007 and has a natural expiration in the mid-2017. Our joint venture Partners continue to review their investment options and this may lead to the marketing and sale of some or all of the assets later in 2016 or early 2017. While the eventual liquidation of the Fund will significantly simplify our joint venture platform, reduce DDR's number of assets below 300 and improve our overall corporate metrics, it will result in the loss of approximately $8 million of annual fee income. We're working with our Partners to maximize their investment, so timing remains somewhat uncertain. But we're projecting a reduction in the fee income at the beginning of the first quarter of 2017. We continue to expect and have budgeted in our guidance modest annual reductions in the $398 million balance of the preferred equity issued to Blackstone joint venture by DDR as opportunistic sales occur to reduce the venture's value and increased it to the highest quality assets. Nonetheless, we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to replace what is perceived as an at-risk short term income with NOI from acquisitions or with structured investments with the highest quality joint venture partners. Before turning over the call to questions, I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank the people who have made my time here at DDR memorable. Over the last four-and-a-half years, DDR has undertaken a remarkable transformation and I'm honored that I was able to be part of that. The organization which you, our investors, own, is in incredible shape thanks to the 577 individuals who continually to strive to achieve a best-in-class results. Very few companies can show the repositioning that DDR can. We have sold nearly $4 billion of lower quality assets, selectively acquired assets which reflect our strategy, while dramatically improving our risk profile. As David will continually say, we're never done improving and over the coming years, I know the Company will continue to do that. Thank you specifically to the staff. It has been an absolute privilege to work with you. You turn up to work every day to make our assets and organization better and I'm truly appear appreciative of all your hard work as are all our investors. Finally to my good mate David, thank you for the opportunity to be part of this organization. And I'm confident that under your leadership, the path forward is even more exciting and the best days of DDR are ahead of you. I will now turn the call to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: In terms of the Sports Authority boxes, is there an opportunity to buy out any of those in order to pursue some larger redevelopments? And then to follow up on that, the major redevelopment pipeline jumped up this quarter, I think it nearly doubled and you included a line of other major projects totaling close to $100 million. So can you give us a little more color on that bucket and more broadly what yields you're expecting on that roughly $400 million of major/minor redevelopments?
Paul Freddo: Jeremy, so let me start with the Sports situation. We feel very good -- there's been a lot of talk over the past couple weeks obviously on what's going on the various portfolios. As you see in our supplement, we have 13 owned of which 12 are wholly owned and as I mentioned in my script, of those 12 every one is in a prime or a prime plus asset. If you further break that down, eight of those wholly-owned Sports Authorities are in our top 50 assets. So we're talking stuff like Shoppers World in Framingham, Midtown Miami, Winter Garden Village, Perimeter Pointe in Atlanta. So as I mentioned, we're watching it very closely. There is a lot of interested parties out there. It starts with the other sports users, Academy and Dick's, all the typical growing great retailers like T.J. and Ross, Nordstrom Rack, the specialty grocery segment. All looking, all expressing interest, exactly how it shakes out in terms of who bids on designation rights, who controls space which can still happen, what we might elect to control to your point because it creates a great redevelopment opportunity. And again, some of those assets I rattled off to you are stuff that we're clearly looking at for future redevelopments and this will provide great opportunity. Obviously if someone acquires that lease in the bankruptcy proceeding, they can assume that lease and proceed. But we're watching it very closely, we're very active and we feel great about the prospects for retenanting where we get the space back, redevelopment in certain cases. In terms of what you saw in the sup with the redevelopment and the development, this quarter, we decided to reclassify further expansions of some of our previous development projects. Belgate in Charlotte, Lee Vista in Orlando and Kyle's in the Austin market fit into that category. These are really -- and by the end of the second quarter, these will all be truly operating centers with most of the initial investment brought into CIP or into service, rather. So we're viewing that adjacent land at those properties, those assets, as true further expansions for redevelopment that will fit into the major category. And as I mentioned last call also, this is something we continue to focus on. We don't want anyone to think we're slowing down on that redevelopment project, if you will, with $250 million active and about another $250 million which fall into the analyzing, going through entitlements, lease-up phase. Returns, clearly in the high singles and with most north of 10% on the redevelopments is our expectation and that's what we're guiding to achieve.
Operator: And our next question is from Craig Schmidt from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: This is probably for Paul as well. Paul, I just wondered if you could categorize the store closing environment this year relative to 2015, as well as maybe the appetite for opening new stores in 2016 versus 2015?
Paul Freddo: If you take the Sports situation which we really view it as it was just a question of when, Craig. It happened a little sooner than I honestly thought, but this is a great time, by the way, to get space back in quality assets and quality locations, given the demand. Some of the other stuff we're seeing is more of I think more of a mall or specialty concept, whether it's PacSun, what's going to happen with Aeropostale and companies like that. I don't see this as a heavier store closing environment than we have. Kohl's was an exception where for the first time they announced some closings, but they've been in a funk, quite frankly. Not going anywhere, a very solid company with a great balance sheet, great earnings results. But they've got grow sales again and redefine their business, if you will and their merchandise mix and their marketing plan and all of that. But overall, I don't see this as any different from prior years. Sports is an exception, but something we'll work our way through given the quality of those locations. Demand, on the other hand, to answer the second part of your question, is as strong as it's ever been. We're seeing incredible demand from the guys we always talk about. We've got an incredible pipeline of deals with T.J. Maxx across all of their concepts and I know you're hearing a lot more about Sierra Trading Post, that's another division of T.J. which is going to grow in a big way. There's no shortage of demand from the quality retailers out there and that's what excites us about getting some of this space back.
Operator: The next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: David, in light of Luke's upcoming departure, two questions really. One, can you comment on the status of your employment agreement? I think the entire executive management team is no longer under contract. All employment agreements expired at the end of 2015. So just curious whether new contracts are being drawn up by the Board and if you could comment on the plan to retain talent at DDR? Then just second, given DDR has a longstanding relationship with Blackstone, what should we read into Luke's departure, if anything, in terms of its impact on DDR? Just given that relationship with Blackstone through various partnerships?
David Oakes: Sure. Regarding employment agreements, you're right, they formally expired at year end and we continue to work with the Board to get those renewed for a multi-year period of time and continue to make progress on that. And hope to be able to show you that progress in the relatively near term. I think from a retention standpoint, we've put great team together here. Luke was a very important part of that, but also one of the risks of having a great team is they're in very high demand elsewhere. And I think you see that in the opportunity that Luke has in front of him and so excited for him. Disappointed for DDR, but do think that there's an extraordinarily strong team in place that is here and committed for a long period of time whatever the exact nature of contracts might be. The relationship with Blackstone has been extremely strong. Over the years, they've been a fantastic Partner, not just to execute on deals with, but also to operate a portfolio with, to invest at the right times and to divest at the right times. Sometimes we've sold together, sometimes they've sold to us. So there really have been a number of iterations of transactions that have worked out very well I think for both sides. There's nothing a makes a partnership better than when both of us make money on transactions. So I think it's worked very well. We have a lot of great contacts over there. Obviously, Luke will be another extremely close one of those. And so would expect that we could continue to do deals with Blackstone, that we'd continue to operate the existing portfolio very actively to create value for that Partnership. Obviously as Luke mentioned, we have budgeted some level of paydown in the preferred equity. Some assets are sold out of one of the ventures with Blackstone. I think over time could you see the potential for some reinvestment there, but probably on a net basis see it get smaller and that's certainly how we've budgeted. But think there could always be new opportunities with a Partner as big and smart and involved and opportunistic as Blackstone is. And I think they've had very good experience with us which would encourage them to certainly stay in good touch as either one of us find opportunities.
Operator: Our next question is from Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: For Palm Valley Pavilions, is there any potential to invest additional capital into that asset? Are there any other acquisitions potentially in the pipeline at this point? And can you comment in regards to the dispositions what cap rates were the Q1 dispositions and the ones under contract?
Luke Petherbridge: Sure, Christy. With regards to Palm Valley, this is a good asset. We see some good opportunities to increase rents there and also just change the merchandising. So it's not something we'd see a huge amount of a redevelopment opportunity, but we do think there's a significant amount of NOI growth. We think we've acquired this based on our internal model north of a 7% unlevered IRR. This is the best asset on the west side of Phoenix. It is a draw. It sits right next to one of the best performing Targets. It's the number three performing Best Buy in the market. And it's somewhere historically in Phoenix where we have had a very, very good presence. We really haven't been strong on the west side. So we thought this was just very complimentary to our portfolio. And I think I made the comment that I can't understate the regional office ability to be able to leverage that. So we think there's a good opportunity there to be able to create additional value through NOI growth. With regard to the first quarter, because Paseo was part of that transaction in our first quarter, cap rate was in the low to mid 5%s, low to mid 5%s, but that was heavily skewed by Paseo. For the full year, we would still expect to be right around about a 7% including the first quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: So if you could help me understand your accounting for same-store NOI and how Sports Authority plays into that. Given that you don't put bad debt is not part of [indiscernible] equation. If there isn't money left over to satisfy the landlords as they come out of bank or as the banks or proceedings go through, would your guidance have to come down? Even at this point right now, because they didn't pay the March rent and I'm not sure about April and May. But I would think that your guidance would have to come down if the cash rents are not there.
David Oakes: Ki Bin, as I tried to outline my opening remarks, we feel extremely comfortable with our same-store NOI guidance range. We have spent a heck of a lot of time over the years refining a process to calculate that number in we think is legitimate a way as possible. There are obviously much broader issues around revenue recognition that our deep accounting team and our auditors at PWC focus on and so think that we've got a very robust process there. And so from a first quarter standpoint, we received rent from Sports Authority for January and February. We did not receive rent for March. However, the overwhelming majority of the month was post-bankruptcy petition, where we think our claim there has an extremely high likelihood of being paid. So forgetting Sports Authority for a second, we have revenue recognition requirements. This is not us taking an aggressive stand. Heck, I'd tell you, the number of gray area situations where I think we try to err on the conservative side is significant. 29 of the 31 days of March we absolutely, at this point, expect to receive rent for and so we have accounted for that rent. If we did take a different status, stance which we don't believe right now is supportable, it would have lowered the same-store NOI by 30 basis points for the quarter. But our revenue recognitions requires that when we think revenue is going to be received, when it has been billed and we believe it will be received, that does need to be booked as revenue. So that's exactly what we've done. We've been receiving April rent payments from them and would expect that rent payments in this post-petition period or in this period of bankruptcy are very high priority for the bankruptcy estate and so would expect to continue to get those. I think where your comment is completely legitimate and in line with the way we've budgeted and thought about it is, the high likelihood that this company in a large number of these locations, if not all of them, are going away for the second half of this year. So obviously, we wouldn't have rent there with the exception of leases that are purchased by other tenants and so that is incorporated into our mind-set and guidance for quarters three and four of this year.
Luke Petherbridge: And then, Ki Bin, I think just taking a step back, not specifically around Sports. When we do budget early in the year and provide guidance, we do obviously look at our watch list tenants. We, I think as a company, have been saying this is an at-risk tenant for over 12 months. When we sit down with Paul and the team, we actually take into account some of that situation. So we're, as David mentioned, there's the high likelihood at the moment that this rent is going away and we still feel comfortable with our guidance range and actually slightly increasing the bottom end.
Operator: The next question is from Alexander Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: So just a question here, you guys mentioned the inland JV fees going away as that venture unwinds at year end. You also mentioned the Blackstone preferreds that will ultimately go away. One of the interesting things about this quarter is you guys finally actually raised guidance. David, I know that you are NAV focused, not FFO, but at the same time, public markets like earnings going up. So is there a way that you guys can balance how the inland fees go away and the Blackstone preferreds get paid off with an ability to reinvest so that we can get to a DDR that's steadily growing both FFO and NAV? Or should we expect some earnings taking a step back as some of these fees and preferreds get paid off before those proceeds can be reinvested?
David Oakes: Your question is something we think about a lot, both internally and at the Board level and have that discussion. And I think when we think truly long term, we would say a couple things. One, we do believe NAV growth is the variable, most highly correlated with successful companies and successful stocks over time. But would also absolutely say that it is highly likely that FFO growth comes along with that net asset value growth. And so do agree with you that we would expect to have both sides of that, if not exclusively NAV growth at the expense of FFO growth. Certain years, this year specifically, I think you do see an NAV strategy that takes away something from current year FFO per share growth, but I think is still very consistent with long term FFO per share growth. Regarding some of the fee income, we have tried to guide as clearly as possible that the domestic retail fund was a 10-year fund with 10-year debts and we're approaching the end of that 10 years. So we just want to make sure everyone understands what is likely to happen there. And so would absolutely acknowledge that there is some fee decline there, but we would expect that the growth in the rest of our business should more than make up for that. A little different story with the Blackstone preferred. Where as that is repaid, it does provide additional capital to be reinvested, whether it's specifically in buying assets as we have at times from the venture in the past or whether it's invested elsewhere. Whether that's debt repayment, whether that's acquisitions or whether that's redevelopment activity, we think the drag on earnings from that repayment should be relatively small. So we sympathize with everyone on the lack of FFO growth in 2016. We don't take that lightly in the slightest. I had some comments in the opening remarks about the end of this period of transition. Which I know for some has been frustratingly long, but I think we're getting to a point where we're at the very end of that. And we do most importantly foresee strong NAV growth and a very low risk profile for this Company, but would also expect that to translate into multi-year FFO per share growth, even if you don't see that in 2016.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: And my question is, how much of the remaining $500 million or so that you plan to sell this year is actually under contract versus under agreement? And we understand that you may be marketing an asset or two in Puerto Rico for sale, is that part of the $500 million? Then could you talk about potential pricing and sizing for Puerto Rico sales, maybe add color on a profile of the assets maybe looking to sell? Are we correct to assume that they would be some of your lower tier assets there? Thanks.
Luke Petherbridge: Yes, Haendel, so definitely on the Puerto Rico path, we aren't actively marketing any assets down there. We've noted that the transaction market down there remains somewhat stagnant. We haven't seen much trade. However, we've made comments and it's something that we would consider but it's potential to some of the lower quality assets. But at the moment, nothing is actually being marketed for sale. With regards to the $500 million, a significant portion of that is under LOI with a credible buyer, someone that we've been working with on a transaction for quite some time. So we still feel very good about completion of the vast majority of the $500 million. And we're not saying this is going to take the next six months to close, we do feel this is something that will happen either the end of this quarter or early next quarter. So mid-year transactions to close. So we wouldn't be throwing a $500 million number out there if we didn't feel like it was actually under agreement and we felt like it was something that will close.
Paul Freddo: After multiple rounds of bidding, two buyers and had advanced to make sure we had certainty of execution there, had advanced contract with one and LOI with the other. And now believe that the one under LOI is the more likely.
Operator: The next question is from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Paul Morgan: So you talked about the midyear dispositions representing the final component of your portfolio evolution. And you've had several years now to track the performance of the different buckets, the prime, prime plus, et cetera. I just wanted to ask whether the characteristics and the performance or the metrics that you demarcated have proven stable? I know assets can move in or out. But broadly, is there anything you could see changing the story there that would maybe make this not the last stage? Or is the same-store results and the rent growth that you've seen in the different buckets consistent with where you expect it and that's what's giving you confidence at the end of the road there?
David Oakes: Yes, Paul, it's a great question and it's one that we ask ourselves since we created this portfolio management group a few years ago. It hasn't just been, let's set the rules for what defines a good asset and what doesn't. It's really let's constantly learn how these assets are performing and how we should think about the different ways to evaluate the quality of an asset, where we have the three basic buckets, quality of the dirt, quality of the tenancy and growth profile over the coming five years. But then how we evaluate the sub categories there and some of that we do take the constancy back from how assets perform, feedback from tenants, sales activity, traffic to reevaluate assets. But certainly would not expect that it results in a major change in our expected disposition portfolio. I think as we've looked through the whole portfolio, we've identified clearly what made sense to sell. And we've been rapidly moving forward on that and so wouldn't expect that bucket to change much. But we're constantly evaluating how these assets perform relative to our grading system. The tough part is the last three or four years of bull market really haven't been the ideal time to evaluate assets, because the biggest differentiator we've found is how they perform in a bear market rather than in a bull market. So I think we're certainly learning a lot as we look at the history of how assets performed over the past decade, more so than just the past couple of years because honestly, you could make the case in a bull market that it's a prime minus bucket with more vacancy that fills up because everything of the highest quality is completely full. So we think we're preparing a portfolio, creating a portfolio that performs well over time, but I think the true test of that is going to be in the next downturn. The true test of that is each case study of a Sports Authority or whatever bankruptcy is next, more so than just the strength of performance that everyone has shown over the past three or four years.
Operator: The next question is from Jason White from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Jason White: First one in terms of the Blackstone joint ventures, is there any chance that those assets might migrate over to the new platform, along with Luke and those fees go away sooner or is that contractually part of DDR's asset management business?
David Oakes: Very much part of DDR's asset management business. We've mentioned the great relationship and contractual relationship with Blackstone. We have always worked with them closely to make sure that those ventures could be very profitable for both of us. And so while we would continue to expect some wind down, some level of asset sales out of those ventures, would not expect just a wholesale movement of those assets to a different sort of venture.
Operator: A question from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is George [indiscernible] on for Tayo. Just wondering if you could talk about your watch list and what other retailers should we be looking for that could be closing stores or having issues in the back half of the year?
Paul Freddo: Yes, George, it's Paul. I mentioned a couple of them earlier with Craig's question. But there's a few, PacSun, Aeropostale are a couple. PacSun is final, the Aeropostale we're expecting. Not anything material on our portfolio at all, but going to be large numbers of closings in mostly malls and some specialty centers. Hhgregg is a tenant we watch very closely. We've got 18 and we're reducing our exposure as we can with that company. Continue to struggle to find the right merchandise mix and their niche in the electronics, appliance, furniture field. But, on the other hand, they have no debt and we do not see them as near term risk. It's just somebody, as I mentioned, how we've been watching Sports Authority for years and careful about the deals we didn't make with them, if you will, that's how we're looking at a company like hhgregg. Obviously there's a big one out there with the pending merger still of Office Depot and Staples that we watch. We should have some resolution within the next 30 days whether that happens or not. We've had intense conversations with both companies. We have a strategy whether there is a merger or whether there is not. But either way, whether there is a merger or not, once that's decided, you will see some store closings in that category also. Again, as we continue to improve the quality of our tenant mix and the credit quality of our tenants, we've made over 88 deals in the last two years with companies like T.J. and Nordstrom Rack and Bed, Bath and Beyond and Dick's. This is what we've been doing. We'll continue to do, we're backfilling with best-in-class retailers with great credit quality, great draws to the center and great ability to lease around them. So that's what we'll continue to focus on.
Operator: The next question is from Greg Schweitzer from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Greg Schweitzer: I was just wondering if you could spend a bit more time on Puerto Rico, both on the fundamentals. Outside of some of the new retailers that are coming in, what else gives you comfort that those trends on the traffic and the sales side will continue to hold up? And then also on the dispositions side, how do you weigh up the pricing that you could get for some of those lower tier assets in Puerto Rico versus just your all-out exposure to the market and what reducing that exposure would signal?
David Oakes: Let me start with a little bit on what we see going on down in Puerto Rico, Greg. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have seen a leveling off of sales. We're continuing to see that through the first quarter of 2016. That was a 2015 story I was referring to with Wal-Mart by far the largest retailer on the island showing small growth in 2015 which is good news and we'd expect that trend to continue. Now that of course is coming off of lows in 2013 and 2014, but it is the trend. As I also mentioned, the traffic we're seeing at the centers has not diminished at all from what we were seeing a few years ago. It's a very high level consumer mentality down there and we're seeing great traffic in the center. We've got the benefit of having leverage with tenants down there. We've spent the last five or six years replacing low credit quality local retailers with high quality regional and national U.S. national chains and that's benefited to us. I didn't mention it earlier today, but we've talked in the past about where our bad debt and our AR, our accounts receivable, sits down on the island and it's that at all-time lows which is also a good sign in terms of where things are going. Tenants continue to make some deals. H&M, Outback and Dave & Buster's, I mentioned, we'll see more of that. Then with a little success, with success as they open, we'll see more retailers see this long term opportunity. This is clearly a down cycle where we're in right now and nobody underestimates that. But there is a long term opportunity for retailers who see such an opportunity.
Paul Freddo: And on the evaluation of potential sales, completely understand your point the way that you and others have written about it, that does it represent an overhang the size of the exposure down there, on the other side of that we're absolutely not a forced seller. Look, we lived through a time seven-ish years ago when we were a forced seller and we know how unpleasant that could be. And so it really is balancing both of those, making sure we're taking a long term view on both sides. Both the prospects for the assets as well as just the uncertainty of the island, where there is greater headline risk, there is greater political risk, greater tax risk and so we have to acknowledge that. So I think what's most important for us is how the assets are performing today which Paul and through materials in the supplement we've outlined a lot of details. Secondly, is the expectation of performance of those assets going forward and what we think the value of those assets can be over time. But don't want you to think at all that it is lost on us, that this does represent an overhang. We're told about it on a daily basis, it represents a lot more than 10% of our time in investor meetings. And so we're certainly cognizant of the fact that it does have an impact on our cost of capital and we take that seriously as we evaluate potential transactions on the island. Although we don't have ideal visibility on private market pricing down there, we're certainly thinking about a lot of ways to maximize value on the island, both near term and long term.
Operator: We have a question from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: So you talked about dispositions. A big slug coming up and really wrapping up the program. Just when you look forward over the next couple of years, what do you think is more of a normalized annual pace once you get past this last big tranche?
Paul Freddo: Yes, I think that's a good way to think about it, because we really are at the end of the bigger portion of asset sales. On a regular basis, when you look at a portfolio of this size, I think you should probably end up with something for sale every year. I think in a few cases, that simply represents a joint venture partner with a wind-down expectation or a time horizon constraint. In other cases on a wholly-owned basis, I think this constant portfolio management process that we go through really does create some level of sell discipline on an asset that you've maximized its value where it is very good and a buyer acknowledges it's very good. We just don't think that the prospect can get any better than where it sits today. I do think you will see some consistent volume, but I think there you are talking in the $100 million to $200 million range. Where clearly there are reinvestment opportunities on the acquisition side, as well as on the redevelopment side. So I don't think you get down to zero disposition activity, but I think you're talking about dramatically smaller numbers, lower cap rates and much more clear reinvestment to lead to no dilution from those sales.
Operator: The next question is from Rich Moore from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore: David, second thing if I could ask you, you said in the press release that you have a deep finance team. And I'm curious why you have chosen to take the interim CFO position instead of giving to the one of the members of the finance team? And then secondly, along the same lines, the employment contract, employment agreement situation seems pretty irregular to me. It seems to have taken an inordinately long time. I'm curious, in your view, what is holding that up?
David Oakes: Sure. We did reference in the press release and comments the size and quality of the team on the finance, accounting, transactions, capital market side here, we're very fortunate through work over the years to have a great team in place. As indicated with the 8-K that we filed that had a little more detail than the press release. This is a very real time. The situation with Luke's departure and so has been a very short period of time that we've had this information and we run a very long term or certainly try to run a very long term business. And so I think there wasn't the pressure to act immediately. I think there's a much greater focus for us on how all the pieces and all the people fit together into the strongest [indiscernible] charts possible. So I think we have exceptional resources here. But also open to see what additional skills and talent we could bring in. We've had a great track record over the years of bringing people here to Cleveland to add to this team. I would expect that could you see more of that, not at all at the expense of the current team but just in addition to that. So I think given the short period of time that we've had to figure this out and given the fact that it was only a little over a year ago that I officially had the CFO hat. We just thought for the interim, it would be easy and understandable and straightforward for me to take that title on as we figure out exactly how to redistribute responsibilities around here as well as how to best position ourselves to continue to bring in additional talent. On the contract side, there's not that much that I can say. There has been very good dialogue between me and Terry Ahern, our Chairman and so I think there's a good understanding on both sides of our long term interest and commitment to this Company. Obviously, I get that it adds a little bit of uncertainty for the market, but I think we're here to tell you as clearly as possible that this team is motivated and committed. I would also tell you that the caliber of this team does create the risk that other companies are going to say, they want to take talent from here and Luke found a fantastic opportunity. It's a credit to him and it's a credit to the strength of the group that we have put together here at DDR and so I think whenever you have a good team, that's always going to be a risk. But I do think you see a strong commitment here, a strong team here and a motivation to continue to create value at DDR over a long period of time.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Lucas from Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: I guess on the -- was I thinking about the changes in the retailer landscape and the bankruptcy trends, I guess I was just wondering if there are things that you guys can do in your lease terms that insulate you? Since it feels like and there's some data that shows us that retailers in general have been tilting more towards liquidation rather than reorganization over the last 10 years. I'm just curious as to whether or not there are things you can do on the lease terms that you can do to increase your control and protect your interests?
Paul Freddo: Chris, it really starts with making deals with the right people and that's what we're focused on. Obviously we're going to have a lot of leases that are going to be subject to retailers that may go into decline and fail over time. Jumping to your question about control, that's very tough. Bankruptcy courts are going to control and they're going to protect the estate and they're going to look to maximize creditor's positions. So there's not a whole lot you can build into a lease. It's not going to be acceptable terms for retailers who are solid retailers, by the way. Bankruptcy Court is what it is and the bankruptcy laws are what they are and they're going to protect those interests. So our focus is clearly and has been for the last six years, let's get the right retailers in place. There's always going to be change in -- as time passes, change in who's good, who's not, who's getting better, who's going the wrong way. And it's our job, as great operators to make sure we're focused on the right winning retailers and that we continue to move our portfolio in that direction.
Operator: We have a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Just to go back to that same-store NOI question. Just to be clear, wasn't questioning how you guys did accounting, just wanted to put the factual definition out there. But along the same lines, just curious, if you did include redev NOI which you guys I know you don't, what would that look like? And second, any other retailers in your top 50 list that you're watching besides hhgregg? And congrats, Luke.
David Oakes: Yes, Ki Bin, I didn't mean to take it the wrong way at all on your question. Just wanted to make sure we gave the details there because we have spent a heck of a lot of time just trying to get to a calculation that answers the question how are these assets growing on average. And so that's also where we've gone through the process to outline the difference between major and minor redevelopments. Because we do think when there's significant capital put into centers, that it isn't truly same-store, that you really have changed that or you've paid for that as a return on that incremental capital. And so the minor redevelopments I think for us as we've clarified these definitions, really fall into the category of releasing. I think if you want to gross up the redevelopment portfolio, you'd call them something more significant than that. But it really is the day to day core releasing activity. There's some capital associated with it, but not massive amounts of capital. And so we really think of that as primarily our leasing efforts. We leave out the major redevelopments which generally would be quite helpful to notional same-store NOI, but obviously because it's a return on considerable capital that was put in, it would push that number 50 basis points or higher. And then I'll give it to Paul.
Paul Freddo: Just quickly, Ki Bin, on the top 50. One of the things to keep in mind as we continue to push people off of the top 50, is reduced exposure and Sears/Kmart would fit high in that category. We've reduced them steadily to now they're not even a top 50 tenant. Pennys was one that was a top 50. And while we think there's some improvement in Pennys' business, it's not a company we'd be making deals with right now. They're off of the top 50. But I would tell you that in addition, hhgregg, Toys R Us is clearly somebody that's up there. Again, no concern at all of the near term filing, but a company that has been losing market share for a number of years and so who we'll continue to watch closely and then Pier 1 on a little lesser category. Their business, they've had some wild swings from tough when the recession came out, very solid in 2011, 2012, 2013 and some issues lately. So again, companies like that we watch, we talk to them regularly, we send our national accounts teams to meet with CEOs, CFOs and heads of real estate and it works for us.
Operator: This will conclude the Q&A session, as well as today's call. Thank you for attending the presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."
33,SITC,2,2016,2016-07-28 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the DDR Corp. Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today’s call will be led by President and CEO, Thomas August. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC. Including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO, operating FFO and same store NOI. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.ddr.com. Last, we will be observing a one-question limit during the Q&A portion of our call, in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom August.
Thomas August: Great. Thank you. First of all, let me apologize to everybody for the glitch this morning. It was a system failure by our service provider that unfortunately we couldn’t control, so we were as frustrated as you are. Clearly is not the way I wanted to begin my tenure here at DDR. We understand there were a number of other companies that experienced the same problem, so again I apologize I know at this time of the quarter you are all pretty busy with the number of calls and this is probably pretty disruptive, but again not much we could do. So let me start, where I thought we were going to be four hours ago with introducing the participants who’ll either speak during the call or certainly be available here to answer your questions. Paul Freddo, Senior Executive Vice President of Development and Leasing. I think most of you know Paul pretty well. Secondly, Vince Corno, Executive Vice President of Development and Leasing. Vince just joined us two weeks ago along the same day I did will be working with Paul. I’m going to let Paul to explain Vince’s background and how they are going to work together in this transition period, but suffice it to say we are really happy that Vince is with us. Christa Vesy is our Chief Accounting Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Christa really stepped up when Luke left and then done a lot more in the last two weeks since I’ve been here, so I’m certainly glad she is here. And Matt Lougee is here with us and Matt is sort of our Senior Vice President of everything. He does a lot of different things and today you probably recognize him mostly as the Investor Relations person. So with that, what I’d like to do is a couple of things. Number one, I want to start off with some observations that I’ve made in the last couple of weeks here at DDR. The actions we’re taking, the results, and I don’t think there is major shifts in our strategy, but there are some changes that I will outline for you. In terms of observations, I think the day-to-day operations are running really well. You can use whatever analogy you would like, the engine running fine, the trains are on time, but things are going well. And it’s not reflected on the history of the Company, it seems that the accomplishments have not been totally, but certainly partially overshadowed by the – to be honest disruption at the top of the organizational chart. And I’d like to give you a few examples and before I do I know that there are a lot of companies that have upgraded their portfolios over the last few years. I would suggest you however, that if you think where we started in 2010, the hill we climbed was a heck of a lot steeper than most companies. So just again bear with me with a few examples. We’ve sold 378 assets for $5.2 billion. We’ve acquired 201 assets for $7.7 billion. I think impressively we’ve turned over approximately 75% of the gross asset value of the Company. We’ve reduced the asset count by 48% from 665 to 349 properties. We’ve increased the asset size 52% from 221,000 square feet to 322 and we have exited 15 different joint ventures. And I think on a softer side, hard to measure and I think the quality of the tenant base in the locations have improved significantly over this time frame. And that’s kind of ancient history. When you look at where we are currently, our same-store NOI has been greater than 3% for 15 of the last 17 quarters. Our current occupancy is 96.1% and we still think there is noticeable upside both in the small shops as we mark-to-market and in the releasing of the Sports Authority space. I’m going to let Paul talk about a little bit later on. Spreads have been good. They’ve been increasing from the high-teens to low-20s. In this quarter, they’re actually 28%. So again I think overall a great solid foundation from the tenants in the portfolio perspective. So what are we doing now? What we’re doing now is mainly for my benefit to get me up to speed on the Company and I hope I’ve created a real sense of urgency here, because we’re doing a complete review of the entire operation, starting with the organization, the structure, the policies, the procedures, the culture. What needs to be changed? What needs to be modified? What can we do more efficiently? Just as an example. We’re a highly centralized Company, probably more centralized than most of our competition. Is that the right thing? The wrong thing, we think it sounds good because of the concentration we have with major national tenants, but again it’s just everything we are looking at. I have temporarily through Labor Day; put a hold on all additional mid and senior level hires of the Company. I think it’s just important before we add to the staff. I just want to make sure I understand what our structure is going to be, what the appropriate qualifications are people in different boxes and then we can look inside the Company as well as outside, so it will be a temporary hold, but it’s on hold for the time being. I’ve made two exceptions to that rule. Number one, we obviously hired Vince. Vince was in the queue when I first started. I had the opportunity to interview Vince well before I thought I was going to be the CEO of DDR. I was very impressive with him and obviously recommended in hiring him and I’m glad he is here. The second is additions to our Board of Directors. This is not in my purview directly; it’s really up to the Board and the nominating and governance committee. But with the changes that have occurred over the last 18 months or so with my now being part of management and not an independent trustee, we are down to five independents with three different committees. It’s kind of tough to staff them, so we will be adding to the Board and I hope that the qualifications of the new member will be from a different perspective to help not only the Board, but help me in the DDR team better run the Company. From the asset side, it’s great time because we’re just beginning the budgeting process, we’re looking at each asset, asset-by-asset, one-by-one, the market, the location, the quality, the tenants, the growth rate, the risk, the opportunities. Do we really want to own this asset in five to 10 years? And one of the things that become apparent and I will tell you upfront this is – we’re at the very beginning, so I don’t want to go overboard on this. But it appears like there are more development and redevelopment opportunities than we had originally focused on. And I think this maybe somewhat of a little bit of a shift in strategy. Over the last couple years, it seems like we’ve been focused on high barrier to entry, good quality properties which is great. But I think we have the capability to add value to a lot of properties through the redevelopment efforts not only of our existing portfolio, but assets we may add. So I want to continue to focus on high quality in-fill locations, but also a greater emphasis on within our portfolio and acquisitions on value added opportunities where I think we can become more of a value creator than just an investor. I try to visit a number of properties, done that on the weekends, lunch hour and on stopovers. So I’ve been to Chicago to see a few assets there. I visit some of the assets in Dallas. I visit some here in Cleveland and I’ve got a trip to Denver, schedule next week to meet our team in Denver and view some assets out there. From a capital markets perspective, I think we’re in good shape. We have nothing that we can do either opportunistically or we need to do in the next 90 days or so. There’s some refinancing opportunities in 2017. We will begin to look at those towards the end of the year, but I think we’re in a fair place right now and I’m glad we can push that off for another 60 to 90 days. In terms of major transactions, again Paul is going to talk about Sports Authority. I think that’s turning out better than we had originally anticipated. In terms of Upstate New York, those assets are still under contract, we expect a third quarter close. We are looking at Puerto Rico. We have developed and we’re developing for our Board of Directors meeting which is the day after Labor Day sort of an overall strategy session of what we want to do in Puerto Rico. I know we’ve not been very clear to the marketplace about what our strategy is there, we’re going to focus on that. Hopefully, we will get an answer from the Board and we’ll be able to articulate exactly what we want to do in Puerto Rico. While we’re looking at all our assets, we are also creating another list of priority assets that we may want to sell in addition to or in place of renewing some of the ones we already are thinking about. So we’re doing that priority list as we look at each asset. In terms of joint ventures, they’re two that are sort of upfront and center, one is, one that we call Manatee. It’s a 55 asset funds with six other funds in it, we have 20%. It started in 2007. It’s coming up on its 10-year life. So those assets will probably be sold. I’m guessing it will be a late fourth quarter or probably into the first quarter sale. There are two factors I think people need to think about on that venture. One, as we collect $8 million to $10 million of fees that’s over $0.02 to $0.03 per share in fees, but I think more importantly we have a right of first refusal on any assets that are sold. So given that flexibility we are just looking at all of the combinations and permutations of what might be best for DDR with that portfolio from letting it wind down and selling it. They are buying a few assets. They’re buying the portfolio with others who might take assets that are not consistent with our strategy. Again, I think that’s something we’re working on right now. We’ll just follow that as the sale process proceeds. The second is Blackstone joint venture, $2 billion investment total. We have 5%. We have obviously a lot of preferreds in there which are I know you talk about quite a bit. We don’t control that sale. There were some assets that we maybe interested in. We don’t control the sale process. So we’re just kind of like hang around the rim, see what happens and see if when something does happen we can take advantage of it to DDR’s benefit. And then of course what we’re doing is taking all these combination, permutations, trying to add them up, subtract them and sort of see how it affects our balance sheet, mainly our leverage in our NAV, but also we recognize the hits that it maybe to earnings, we’re just kind of looking that and trying to balance at the best way we can. I’m not sure that any of you are expecting guidance for 2017 on this call, but given that I’ve been here two weeks and given all that’s up in the air, we certainly are not prepared at this point to give that, we’ll do it at some point in the future. The other thing I’d like to talk about is the role of JV’s with DDR. I think joint ventures certainly play a role in our capital structure, but on the other – especially from time to time given our cost of capital. But on the other hand, there’s only 24 hours in a day and as someone once told me you only have so many mental calories to spend. And I’d like to spend our mental calories on assets that create the best value and the most value for DDR. I think the fee income is great, but I’m more interested in creating value with the asset level. So again I think joint ventures have a place at DDR, but we need to be a lot more selective than we’ve been in the past. So what are we trying to do? What we need to do is finish up this transition period and what I call Phase I of our transition story. It’s been a long slog. We’ve been at it for six years. We’ve done a lot. We’ve got some to go. We need to sell some assets. We need to get our debt done a little bit. And we’re probably a little bit late in the game, but we’re moving ahead, we’re going to get this done pretty quickly. And then what we need to do is think about how we’re now thinking about joint ventures, how we’re now thinking about Puerto Rico, how we’re now thinking about redevelopment and develop, articulate and begin to execute on the long-term strategy that shows our constituents starting with our employees, our shareholders, our partners. Why you should own. Continue to own or own more of DDR stock. I think we’ve got a great floor as I said at the beginning in this presentation. And I think we now need to take our eyes of the floor and begin to look up to the ceiling to see how higher upside is. I just like to end my little pitch here with one comment. As you can appreciate over the last two weeks, there has been a lot written about the change in the CEO role here at DDR and one of the comments is that I personally don’t have retail experience and I think that’s a valid comment. I’ve been in the real estate business for 44 years, most of my experience has been in office and then to a certain degree, a lesser degree than that in industrial. But I don’t think as I see here today is that retail expertise is a pressing need for DDR. When I see Vince joining us, working with Paul, a very long transition period, the rest of the staff we have here, Paul’s team. I think we’re in great shape. Now that’s not to say, look at - I want to say right now. We can always use good, smart motivated people retail expertise or not. So if you know any good, smart people who want to join DDR tell them to call me, we will find a place for them. We’re going to give them a great opportunity, but retail we are set. The need here in my opinion is stability at the CEO level, filling a few senior positions we have, leadership in developing a strategy again to convince you why you should own this Company. So I will learn the retail business. I will work hard. I’m going to do my best to deliver on those promises and what we need at DDR today. So thank you Paul.
Paul Freddo: Thanks, Tom. I would first like to elaborate on the announcement of Vince Corno, joining DDR two weeks ago as our new Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development. Vince has been in the retail real estate industry for nearly 25 years and brings a wealth of knowledge about the retail sector after previous roles as Senior Vice President of Real Estate at DICK’S Sporting Goods, Saks and the May Company as well as Vice President of Development at Forest City. He is an extremely well-known and respected figure in the retail real estate industry with extensive retail and landlord contacts. Vince will report to our CEO, Tom August and fulfills our succession plan with the optimal candidate. As I wind down my tenure here at the Company during the first half of 2017, my plan is to familiarize Vince with our portfolio, our people, and our processes in order to ensure an orderly transition of my duties to Vince upon my departure. In fact, next month we will conduct our multi-week portfolio review process in order to analyze the strategic plan and long-term prospects for each asset. Given Tom and Vince’s recent start, we will also use it as an opportunity to introduce them to the portfolio and further develop future growth opportunities across the portfolio. We are excited to have Vince on Board and we fully expect that you will be as pleased as we are with his knowledge of the business and his ability to sustain and improve upon our consistently strong operational results. Turning to the quarter, I was very pleased with the performance of our team and the result they delivered and equally as pleased to see how [indiscernible] portfolio upgrade continues to flow into strong operating metrics. We produce same-store NOI growth of 3.1% which consisted of domestic NOI or 87% of the same-store pool growing at an impressive rate of 3.7% attribute to the strength of the portfolio after our multi-year transformation. Puerto Rico same-store NOI was negative 0.5% an improvement from last quarter, but still causing a drag on the overall same-store NOI figure by approximately 60 basis points. For the year, we see no shift in our original same-store guidance range of 2.5% to 3.5% inclusive of the Sports Authority impact which I will discuss shortly. Year one rent per square foot on new deals which totaled 430,000 square feet in the quarter was in excess of $20 per square foot and the second highest starting rent on new deals in Company history. Inclusive of renewals, the blended rate per square foot was the highest total in five quarters and 17% above DDR’s average rents signed since 2009. While the composition of our portfolio with a disproportionate amount of box square footage does not compare favorably to other retail property types in terms of in-place rent. The continued upward trend in starting rent is material and indicative of the portfolio upgrade. As you have seen from DDR over the past few years, we have not chosen the path of simply buying shopping centers with attractive demographics or high in-place rents as these characteristics alone do not directly translate into value in the private market. Instead, we have sold weak assets and bought prime assets with attractive growth regardless of in-place rents. As a result, we have grown the rent per square foot of the Company at an annual rate of over 4% through both organic growth which was evident this quarter and through selling lower quality assets. We would expect a continued upward trajectory of this metric in future quarters. The lease rate for the quarter was flat on a pro rata basis at 96.1% as we absorbed two rejected Sports Authority leases. However, we continue to show great progress, leasing small shop space with a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter and a 170 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the number of new credit worthy concepts looking to expand into small shop space and expect that trend in addition to fewer move-outs to continue to positively impact net absorption for our shop space. The final two points I would like to address on the quarter are on regards to new lease spreads and the bumps associated with those leases. In the second quarter, we achieved a new deal spread of 28% the highest on record for DDR in 30 quarters. Recent trends and future expectations point to continued spreads in the mid-to-high teens or low 20% range on new leases and high single-digits on renewals. Additionally, the 103 new leases signed in the quarter have a compounded annual growth rate of 170 basis points significantly higher than the portfolio average of approximately 125 basis points, and representative of a very focused initiative from our leasing team to drive annual increases beyond historic norms and provide a future benefits to same-store NOI. Turning to the Sports Authority news, as you know the retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March and was the first sizeable bankruptcy in our space in recent years. The eventual liquidation highlighted the dramatic shift occurring in retail and the difficult environment for achieving and sustaining both profitability and relevance to the consumer. On the bright side, the bankruptcy provides DDR with an excellent opportunity for us to showcase not only the work we have done in recent years reducing exposure to weak credits. But going forward, it will highlight the quality of our portfolio as we make progress on backfilling the 13 boxes. Regarding our exposure, we have 12 boxes in wholly owned centers and one in a 5% owned joint venture, totaling 70 basis points of pro rata base rent well below the sector average. All 12 of the wholly owned boxes are in prime or prime plus centers with seven of the 12 in our focus 50 prime plus portfolio such as Shoppers World in Boston, Perimeter Pointe in Atlanta and Midtown Miami. Demand for this space is robust highlighted by the purchase of the designation rights by Dick’s Sporting Goods, T.J. Maxx and Burlington are four of the Sports Authority leases during the recent auction process. Despite our minimal exposure having four designation rights purchased was the highest amongst all of our peers and indicative of the quality of these locations. We expect Sports Authority to return the remaining nine locations to us in the immediate future and we do not expect to receive rent after July for those rejected locations. This will cause downward pressure on second half 2016 same-store NOI to the magnitude of approximately 80 basis points in the third quarter and 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and first half of next year. As I mentioned previously, this impact is and has been contemplated in our full-year same-store NOI and FFO guidance. I would also like to note that in the first quarter, we did not reserve for the majority of March rent as we expected the balance to be collectable at the conclusion of the bankruptcy process and our position has not changed. We look forward to updating you on a future calls about the releasing of the remaining nine boxes as our leasing team pursues best-in-class sporting goods, off-price apparel, beauty and specialty grocery retailers. Next, I would like to briefly address Puerto Rico. Well, we are encouraged with the recent progress made by the U.S. Congress to intervene, there is little new news to report on a micro level that is material. Although, we did see a 100 basis point improvement in same-store NOI since last quarter. As Tom mentioned, we’re reviewing the overhangs such as Puerto Rico that are associated with our Company and expect that senior management, the Board will conclude on the most thoughtful path for shareholder value creation over the long-term. With that said, our leasing and development teams remain laser focused on maintaining cash flow stability and even exploring ways to grow on the island such as the $12 million expansion of Plaza Del Sol to accommodate the island’s first Dave & Buster’s and the island’s second H&M which will be opening this quarter also at Del Sol. We remain encouraged by the health and sales of the majority of our tenants and we will continue to provide updates on asset level performance going forward. The final item I will discuss is our development pipeline. As you will see in our supplemental, we have transferred Lee Vista Promenade in Orlando to operational as the vast majority of the project is now online. We’re encouraged to report that our legacy pipeline now consists of only Guilford Commons outside of New Haven. 97% of the estimated cost of $69 million has been spent and 70% of that spend has been placed in service, but stabilization expected in the fourth quarter of this year. While centers like Guilford and Lee Vista are high quality prime shopping centers that DDR will own over the long-term. The dilutive returns associated with these deals are sub optimal and we’re pleased to report that we’ve quickly approaching the end of that legacy pipeline. Additionally, in the second quarter we also sold a parcel of land in Jupiter, Florida that was originally slated for ground-up development. This sale is an example of how we will continue to chip away the legacy land bucket which currently consists of $44 million of non-income producing assets all of which are being marketed for sale. As a result, we are pleased to report that we have decreased the amount of consolidated land and CIP as a percentage of gross asset value from 10.7% in 2008 to merely 1.7% today. A change that significantly decreases our risk profile and ties up much less of the balance sheet in non-income producing assets. Notwithstanding the conversation surrounding legacy development, we will continue to move forward with our redevelopment pipeline which provides us with over 100 million of spend annually at attractive returns in the 9% to 10% range and additionally pursue a strategic discussion with Tom, Vince and the Board regarding where ground-up development fits in DDR’s strategy going forward. And I’ll now turn the call over to Christa.
Christa Vesy: Thank you, Paul. For the second quarter, operating FFO was $122.4 million or $0.33 per share, which is a 6.5% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $120.3 million, also $0.33 per share. Non-operating items related primarily to land sales. During the second quarter, we also received approximately $3 million of additional management fee income related to the amendment of our asset management agreement with one of our joint venture partners that provided for a one-time payment upon execution. This payment is a non-recurring event and recurring quarterly fee income for the remainder of the year should continue to be in the range of $8 million to $8.5 million which is inline with our original guidance. When adjusting for the wind down of our commingled joint venture, the DDR domestic retail fund which is projected for year-end 2016, recurring quarterly fee income should be approximately $5 million. Additionally, as Paul discussed in detail, the timing of the Sports Authorities auction process pushed all rent loss associated with that bankruptcy from the second quarter and into the third quarter, given both of these items as well as the slight delay in the closing of our asset sales that are under contract. We are increasing our full-year operating FFO guidance range by $0.02 at the midpoint to a range of a $1.23 to a $1.26 per share. Turning to transactional activity. We closed on the sale of three operating assets and three land parcels for $58 million at our share during the second quarter, bringing full-year disposition to $282 million with an additional $505 million under contract. All of the operating assets under contract for sale are expected to close in the third quarter. Notably the portfolio located in Upstate New York comprises approximately 80% of the assets under contracts and the potential buyer has significant capital invested in due diligence. Currently the buyer is working to finalize debt financing which is progressing. Although it is taking longer than anticipated the expectation is at the sales to close in the third quarter. While these assets do not necessarily fit DDR’s investment strategy, we are confident that we would have alternative disposition options if this buyer is unable to close. Assets sales under contract and close year-to-date totaled $787 million at our share which is in line with the high-end of our original disposition guidance of $600 million to $800 million. These assets are fully occupied institutional quality shopping centers that average 200,000 square feet and carry a weighted average cap rate in the low-to-mid seven. However their low growth profile and locational qualities are not representative of the type of assets DDR wants to own long-term. While the management team will be conducting portfolio reviews over the next few weeks, we finally believe we are at the end of the major disposition process outside of purely opportunistic sales. We are also under agreement to acquire to power centers located in the high barrier to entry markets of Chicago and Portland for a combined value of $168 million. Both centers are expected to close in the third quarter and will bring total annual acquisition volume to $229 million approaching our original acquisition guidance of $250 million and fully funded with the disposition proceeds. The remaining $550 million of expected net transactional proceeds will provide enough liquidity to fund continued debt repayments and allow us to lower debt-to-EBITDA by 0.5 to 0.8 times to reach mid-6 level by year-end. In the second quarter consolidated debt-to-EBITDA sell by approximately 3.3 times to 6.66 times which is within 0.2 times of our previously stated year-end goal. In addition to reaching a post-recession low for debt-to-EBITDA and a post-recession high for fixed charge coverage ratio this quarter we are confident that our risk profile and the quality of our EBITDA stream are well-positioned for both bull and bear markets going forward. With that said while senior management and the Board will be discussing the optimal balance sheet strategy in the near-term. We would fully expect that additional deleveraging past 6.5 times should occur. There continues to be no need to access the capital markets in 2016. Following the close of the assets under contract we will have completed all necessary dispositions and will return to a normalized level of opportunistic transactional activity. However, two headwinds to earnings remained despite their strategic merits. The first is the imminent wind down of our commingled joint venture, the DDR Domestic Retail Fund. We have a 20% interest in the 55 assets held in the fund which was originated in 2007. The 10-year mortgage debt encumbering the assets creates the natural expiration of the venture in 2017. We have articulated to the market that we expect the culmination sale of the fund around year-end resulting in a loss of $10 million in fees going forward. It is worth noting we do have a rope around the portfolio that provides us flexibility and whether or not we stay involved on all or portion of these assets. We are conducting a strategic review of our options involving this venture. It includes the wind down of the venture with no future participation. Continuing equity ownership and/or management of the assets or purchasing a select group of high quality power centers that align with our investment thesis. The second headwind is the long-term outlook of our joint venture with Blackstone. It is an overhang given the preferred equity component and portfolio quality and DDR and our partner will look for an exit at a yet to be determined point to achieve their returns and clean-up our structure. The timing of asset sales as well as any eventual liquidation is fully dictated by Blackstone. Our economic interest in venture of assets are minimal 5%, but the fund generates the significant amount of management fees as well as interest income tied to $400 million of preferred equity. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O’Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you. Good morning. Sorry, good afternoon. Originally it was good morning. Good afternoon, Tom and team. Tom just a question here, it’s a two parter, but it involves the same element. If you can – one, you talked about stability and the need on the portfolio and investment side to create some stability with the various investments, so on one hand originally prior management had spoke about nearing the end of the clean up and you outlined what sounds like there maybe a lot more cleanup to go. But the second part is at the C-suite level in the past seven years there’s been three CEO’s, so how do you bring stability to the C-suite. So one is on the investment side stability and the other one is from a leadership standpoint stability?
Thomas August: Maybe I misspoke, but I tend to try to say that we are near the end, but we just got to hurry up and get there. We are dragging this out a lot longer than we had hoped and I think that everybody is looking for us to finalize the last few sales to get over the hump, but I don’t think it’s more to do I think we just want to do it quicker. In terms of the C-suite I’m signing a three-year deal. I’m here and I think we want to add people to the – we added Vince, we’re adding others to stabilize that, so I don’t see any contradiction in terms. We just need to get it going to be honest I’m the fourth CEO not the third.
Operator: The next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Tom, you’ve been doing a more in-depth review of the Company and its strategy, what’s driving that decision. Is that from your take on what you’ve seen since you became part of the management team in the last few weeks or - and a deeper review is needed or is that more Board driven as the result of any prior concern. So what does have happened regardless of David’s termination?
Thomas August: Well, I mean it happened because I’m unfamiliar I joined the Board in May, so I attended one meeting and I just felt before – to me is where are you, where you want to go and how do you get there and before we decide where we want to go, how we get there, I’ve got to figure out where we are, so I just wanted to do a quick and an in-depth analysis I could have sort of the whole Company from the asset side, the liability side, and the organizational side so we could make more intelligent decisions on how to proceed both organizationally and with our strategy on the assets.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. Tom, I’m just curious I know there was no severance charges related to David’s termination, but were there any costs in the quarter or anticipated in future quarters just regarding the whole termination process and I wasn’t sure if there was any sort of outstanding lawsuits from either David if he ever filed for wrongful termination or from potential third parties whether they be internal or external that may have been a reason or part of the termination process?
Thomas August: There are no lawsuits that we know up for sure; I mean nothing has been filed. We don’t anticipate any. We don’t anticipate reserving for anything in our cost to date if we’ve incurred some have been very minimal.
Operator: The next question is from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Tom, you mentioned there being more of both development and redevelopment opportunities and the Company you may have realized previously. Is the development you’re talking about expansion opportunities of existing centers or is this ground-up development, new sites with existing land, just looking for some clarification. And then can you comment on how much more sizable you suspect the opportunity might be over time?
Thomas August: Well, number one I would tell you that we are not talking about necessarily ground-up, the real focus was on the development within the portfolio. I’m going to let Paul comment on the size, but again all I’m saying is just from the beginning of our review with some of these assets there are more opportunities that we identified than we had previously thought and since we haven’t gone through the portfolio, it’s difficult to quantify the excess over what our original estimates were.
Paul Freddo: Todd. Yes, this is Paul. One of the things, we got a great advantage with the timing with Vince and Tom just coming on with this portfolio review, which is an extensive review of every asset in the portfolio which will be doing over the entire month of August, but really the way I look at it is and we’ve accomplished quite a bit, we’ve been somewhere around $600 million on about a six-year program and redevelopment with yields that average somewhere north of 10%. This is a fresh look at the portfolio because we do realize that redevelopment is one of the greatest ways we’re going to grow this Company and it’s a skill set we have, we will look at ground-up, but as we have talked about many times on these calls, it’s not a significant mover of the needle for us or anybody else in the industry. So skill set we have. We will maintain it. We will look for opportunities. We’re going to remain very disciplined and how we might go after the ground-up side of it if at all, but that’s something that as we get through the process of reviewing the portfolio and what our skills are and where we want to go, we will come up with a better determination. One of the things we have talked about very early on that we haven’t really focused on since we started this redevelopment program years ago was value add opportunities. Again, I feel very strongly that’s a skill set we have here at DDR, we should take advantage of it. Tom alluded to that in his prepared remarks about creating value versus just buying quality assets that [indiscernible]. So we’re going to look at it all. Fresh eyes on it, Vince had some development experience in his background with Forest City here in Cleveland and he seen it all from various retailers side. So it’s a good healthy look at the entire portfolio and see where we can go with it.
Operator: The next question is from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hi, everyone. Just curious in terms of the stability of the organization. Just curious if you could comment on sort of the morale of the group given the suddenness of the change here as well as any thoughts on potentially reallocation of sort of the human capital as you think about the organization?
Thomas August: Well, I’m obviously biased, but I’d like to think that the morale is pretty good. I mean clearly when you walk in at Monday morning and make an announcement that your CEO is no longer here, there was a bit of what the heck happened and a bit of a shock. But my focus is not been on and I’ve tried to be really diligent. I’m not looking back over my shoulder, I’m looking forward and I’m trying to convince everybody else that there’s still great opportunities here at DDR. We got a lot of things going for us. We’ve been through a lot of organizational changes, I can’t argue that, but if you look forward the opportunities look pretty bright and let’s do that. And I think that again from my perspective and I’m biased because I’m trying really hard to do this, I think the morale is good. And the capital – I don’t know, we got a lot of good people. I just need to understand it, we’re going to finish that process up real quick. I don’t expect a lot of reallocations, but I just want to make sure I understand what everybody’s position is, what they do the skill set et cetera, et cetera. So I think we’re well on our way to that.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon. So, Tom maybe you could expound or clarify a bit on the comments you made about potential sale of Puerto Rico asset. It’s been something that’s been contemplated for a while at DDR, but as I understand it, there’s been less interest in the DDR’s part in selling the best assets on the island, Plaza Del Sol, which I’m sure would garner interest, but that’s one you’d be probably more willing to sell, the bottom rung. There’s not much of a bid there. So can you give me a sense of what you’d like to do and how maybe the Puerto Rico portfolio looks in a couple of years as you get to execute how you want. And then maybe some sense, current sense of what cap rates are on the island for the better and then maybe the bottom tier assets?
Thomas August: Haendel, let me first suggest that I think I better discuss our strategy with the Board before I discuss it with you. As I said in my remarks, we are preparing a presentation for the Board. This is going to be a Board decision on the strategy and you’re right we have talked about some of the low quality, the high quality, no quality, all the quality. And I think to be honest more appropriate to review this with the Board and make sure I get their perspective before we comment on exactly what we want to do.
Operator: The next question is from Jeremy Metz with UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: Hey, guys. I know you talked about a hold on hiring for the time being, but one of the holds following Luke’s departure was that sort of CIO role. So just wondering if you give us your views there and if that’s the spot you’ll be looking to backfill down the road and then maybe bigger picture Tom your thoughts on the current G&A load of the Company?
Thomas August: Again, clearly that was an empty – it’s a spot that’s been empty which again probably 30 days before we figure out our structure and if that’s the position we need we’ll look internally and then go externally I mean clearly I think what is for sure. We want a senior person whether here or outside who can access deals, has good financial background, and can help us execute our strategy of growing the Company. Once we get over this review, we’ll see if we have that person internally if we don’t will go outside, but we’re going to make those decisions pretty quickly, but I think it would just been a little bit rash to go out and start hiring people before I understood who is here and what exactly our structure was.
Operator: The next question is from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: Yes. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on sort of the delay in asset sales. I guess one with the upstate portfolio is that delay just - purely just because of problems with getting financing and then also are there any other sort of broader delays on asset sales in the portfolio? And if so kind of what’s driving that?
Thomas August: Number one, I don’t think there’s any just broader issues for the delay, this is a big portfolio, it’s a lot of different assets. I think it’s just taking time given the flexibility that the buyer wants to have with his financing to put the pieces all together. We know that they’ve been spending money, they probably in excess of the million dollars I’m guessing I don’t know the exact number. They’re certainly following through on their due diligence. So I think it’s just an overall look at we like good - they want good financing, they want flexibility and they’re taking their time and putting that pieces together.
Operator: The next question is from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: I was going to ask you Tom what has surprised you the most since you’ve been at the organization on the positive side and also where do you think you’ve got maybe the most work to do?
Thomas August: Well, I think on the positive side to be honest, I was - again I’m not you know we’re not unique, okay I’m not trying to say we’re unique. But the amount of change that has occurred in this Company since 2010 has been enormous. Now we often had a bigger hill to climb, but the amount – it just surprise me and it surprise me to be honest how well the team and the organization has worked given to be honest the dysfunction at the CEO level and that has really surprised me. And I think what’s - I don’t want to say which takes the most work, but I think we’ve been so focused on sort of fixing things that we just going to turn our attention to how we’re going to grow. Because we just got a little more to go to get over the goal line and then we’re going to grow. And we just need to be able to shift as they say in politics we need to be able to pivot. We need to pivot towards the growth strategy from sort of fixing the balance sheet.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey good afternoon. Just a quick question I know you’re still thinking about how you are looking to position the Company. But I’m just curious just from your vantage point. Would it be something that you’d be looking at running a much smaller portfolio of assets? Overall I know in the past DDR is highlighted that your top 100 assets contribute about 50% of your NOI. So how are you thinking about that being in the [indiscernible] and I recognize you’ve only done this seat for a couple of weeks?
Thomas August: Oh! Please recognize that this comment comes from someone who’s been only two weeks to it but I don’t think we’re focused on size, we’re focused on the bottom line for our shareholders and if it means we grow, we grow that means we shrink, we shrink. I mean I don’t think to be honest given a lot of thought to the size as being a factor in how we want to position the Company. It’s really is what we’re focused on it we’re going to create the most growth for the Company and create the most accretive for our shareholders and the size has not been a factor or something we really spent a lot of time thinking about yes. Maybe I will as we go forward but certainly not yet.
Operator: The next question is from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Good afternoon. Tom, I recognize you need to be sensitive, but I’m curious what was it about the DDR culture that brought us to this point? And how significant could administrative changes ultimately be to assure that the organization gets to a place where you think investor confidence is restored and I guess if I could in sort of follow-up. Just over the past few years under prior CEO’s DDR kind of flirted with various satellite office locations, New York, Chicago. For whatever reason just given the opportunity you have now to sort of re-staff the C-suite, you know, are you going to contemplate locations outside of Cleveland for the organization?
Thomas August: Well, we have a few already, number one – let me answer the second part first. We have a few already. And secondly, as I said in my opening remarks we’re pretty highly centralized, we’re analyzing whether that’s the best model for us. It seems to be because of our concentration with our top 20 or 30 tenants, but that’s something that we were continuing to analyze. What got us to this point I really don’t care. I really couldn’t care less what got us to this point. Here is where we are today and we’re keeping our eye looking forward, I have no interest in looking backward. If it could be helpful, I would, but I’m not sure it will be helpful so I’m just looking forward. And what happened in the past, happened in the past that’s not my concern and I’m here to fix whatever is where we are from today going forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas: Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome Tom. I guess I wanted to touch on one of the topics that you mentioned, which was filling an independent Board seat you vacated. And I guess the current Board members have a great deal of private real estate expertise and tenure. I guess I was wondering what kind of characteristics or background are you looking to backfill that independent Board seat. And then maybe on a second part just from your perspective, does your move to management negatively or positively impact your ability to make organizational changes from being an independent Board member in your view.
Thomas August: Let see, number one, the Board qualification, you’re right, we’ve got a lot of real estate expertise. I think there are other things that – first of all let me check this is the dominating government committee decision, not mine. I will certainly try and influence it the way I think we should do it, but it’s their decision to make. And I think whether it’s a retail, whether it’s a financial expert, but certainly someone I think we have plenty real estate expertise. So someone with a different perspective that again as I said in my opening remarks will help the Board and help me and the team run this Company better. So different than a real estate expertise, retail, financial that comes to mind, but we’ll see. In terms of the decisions I think I have more influence. My position is that the Board is involved in the Board level decisions and then I am running the Company and there’s a lot of decisions that are – they’re my decisions to make and I will certainly make them in consultation with the Board because I value their input, but ultimately they’re my decisions to make and that’s the way we’ll make them.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe this question is for Paul since Tom you’re obviously very new and maybe don’t have this history, but in terms of the redevelopment and trying to I guess want to speed those up or you found more of them and going through the review. I guess I’m trying to understand maybe why those weren’t brought to light in the past or what’s – I guess what made you uncover them today versus a six months ago, 12 months ago, 18 months ago?
Paul Freddo: Steve, we haven’t uncovered anything in the past two weeks and we do have a pretty significant pipeline of pending deals which is probably in the $300 million to $400 million range. The thought we’re trying to get across, we’re going to take a fresh look at everything in this organization starting with the portfolio and that’s going to bring to light, different ways of going about it and I mentioned the value add which is something we’ve really not focused on since we started the program six or seven years ago. So it’s not like we’ve uncovered anything in the last two weeks that’s earth-shattering or huge number. I’m very confident what we have in our pipeline and ability to deliver somewhere between $100 million to $150 million a year of redevelopment spend and then bring into service. So we’re just going to take a fresh look at it, scrub it, look at how we can do things a little differently and see where we can create more value. So it’s not something we’ve been sitting on, no lack of confidence in the folks that deliver or execute on that program, it’s really – let’s just see how we can do it better and do it quicker.
Thomas August: And Steve, just the focus – it just you know when you’re looking in one direction you kind of miss a little bit in the other, it’s not that’s been over looked, it’s just that this has been the primary focus, how do we buy high quality assets in infill locations. I think we just need to open our eyes a little bit wider and have a broader perspective.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Great. Thank you. Tom you’ve expressed this sense of urgency, this complete review of the organization you mentioned policies, procedures, cultures. I’m curious you didn’t mention a review of corporate governance and the Board of Directors and so outside of just adding an independent to the Board. You look at the Board is constructed now eight members, five have been there for an average of almost 16 years which would have covered all four prior administrations including yours or four administrations. You have two from the Germans which obviously own a lot of stock and have that right to those seats and then you have yourself as CEO. Will you as part of this review look at the Board and make a recommendation if you decide that changes need to be made and if not if you’re not going to do that why and secondarily, if your recommendation is status quo other than adding independent. Do you think that the Company is at risk from you know from a slate that’s put up that would want to see better effective management of the organization?
Thomas August: Well, let me answer the last part first I hope that better management the organization has been addressed the last two weeks. So that’s number one. Secondly, is I understand the issue about longevity of the Board members. I think unfortunately or fortunately we’re in a position now what we need to add we can’t rotate to and I think that adding too many Board members at once is a risk as well just the culture in the thinking of the organization. So A it’s not my ultimate decision. I can make a recommendation to the Board. And right now my recommendation to the Board we need to add somebody and we need to add one or two people with a different perspective than as the previous one. The previous caller suggested financial expertise and our real estate expertise and bringing some of the financial or retail expertise. So ultimately I’m sure at some point there will be a rotation right now I’m more focused on the additions and bringing in a different perspective. End of Q&A
Operator: This concludes our Q&A session and the conference as a whole. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
34,SITC,3,2016,2016-10-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to DDR Corp.'s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran, Senior Financial Analyst. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you Angie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from President and CEO, Tom August; Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Vince Corno; and Executive Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO, Christa Vesy. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Additional information about such risks and uncertainties, that can cause our actual results to differ, may be found in the press release issued yesterday and the documents that we file with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO, operating FFO and same store NOI. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures and most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found on our earnings press release issued yesterday. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.DDR.com. Last, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom August.
Thomas F. August: Thank you, Meghan. Good morning everybody and thanks for listening into our call. As Meghan said I'm in the room here with Paul Freddo, Vince Corno, Christa Vesy, and Matt Lougee. I want to talk about three things today. First is just to reflect for a couple minutes on some meetings I have had recently with analysts and investors. I am going to make a few comments about the quarter and then Vince and Christa will sort of fill in on a lot of that, and then really focus on the strategic issues that we have been addressing the last few months here. Let me start out -- I sort of stayed here in Cleveland and visited properties during the summer, and went out on sort of a tour with visiting analysts and investors in Boston and Washington, a conference, a dinner. And I'm getting the same response from everybody, and that is, you're tired of the DDR story. It's always next year when things are going to get better. I'm the third CEO who says, we will get things better, and I guess, really as you look at the stock, price things haven't changed to everybody's satisfaction. I understand everybody's frustration, but unfortunately I can't go back to 2014 or 2015 and do things differently than they were actually done. All I can tell you is I am sitting here in October of 2016, we are going to tell you what we're going to do and then we plan on going out and getting it done. I wish there was more I could do, but we are doing everything we can and thinking of all the ways we can to try and create value for the company. I appreciate those of you who have stuck with us, and I certainly understand the rationale for those of you who haven't. We are a real show me company right now. We are not a trust me company. We need to earn back your confidence, and it's going to take time, and it is going to happen, not because I say so, but because we deliver on promises we are making to you in actual results. So again I just wanted to sort of say that to start off. On a quarterly basis things are looking good. The day-to-day operations continued to perform very well. We have had a pretty active leasing quarter with over 300 leases signed for almost three million square feet. Our occupancy dipped a little bit because of The Sports Authority, but we are still at over 95% leased, I believe 95.4%. Our same-store growth was a good 3.4%. Leasing spreads continue to be pretty strong. We are up 21.1% on new and 8% on renewal. And we are making really good progress on our problem tenants, that Vince is going to go into little bit, namely Sports Authority and Golfsmith. So all-in-all I think a very good operational quarter. We had impairments, and that just resulted from our projected increase in sales over the next year or two. I think as you all know once we put an asset into a potential sale category we need to look at it through sort of a different prism from an accounting perspective and that's what we have done. None of this related to any land. It all related to operating properties and it was pretty well spread throughout the portfolio. Let me move to sort of the strategic issues if I will. Organizationally -- I am going to start internally. We have made some changes internally that I think will allow us to operate more efficiently. We've combined a couple of positions that had been separated. Most notably we are also creating a more formal structure with our asset management team, which will be led by Matt Lougee. And what we are doing is forming teams with Matt's group and asset management and portfolio management and operations and leasing, I think to create a more disciplined look at the way we are looking every center, so that everybody has a team to have ownership of the bottom line and will be incentivized based on the bottom line results. And the CIO/CFO search, I started that probably right around Labor Day with the CIO and the CFO followed. I had hoped today to be able to give you some results. Unfortunately I'm close, but I can't announce anything at this point in time. Additionally, I've been speaking with the Board quite a bit and what we have agreed is, that we may also be seeking to hire a President or CEO role. As many of you have pointed out my background is not in retail, and I think adding more retail experience, at the senior level of the company to complement the people we have here will just do nothing but help us going forward. So the goal is really to have a significant amount of what I call intellectual capital with retail experience at the senior level. And then secondly, and this just really relates to, I think good management practices and succession, is I would hope that one or possibly more of the people, either internally or those who we bring on board will be in a position to take my place at some point in the future. So good, just good succession planning. Hopefully I will be able to show you some progress in that pretty shortly. I want to talk about the Board for a minute. The Board has agreed that we will be seeking two new Board members. This will allow us, first and foremost, to more adequately fill out some of our committee rotations. We are kind of short now with five independent board members, in how we fill our committees. I think, also, given the different background of getting a different perspective, whether the new Board members are in technology or e-commerce or capital market, will give me a different perspective and I think will help me run the business more effectively. I'm not sure exactly when those Board members will be added, maybe by February but certainly by our Annual Meeting in May. Let me move on to our portfolio review and our deleveraging strategy. We spent a lot of time this summer looking at the portfolio. Vince and I have been on the road quite a bit. I've recently been to Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Chicago and Denver. The rest we have seen sort of via Google Earth. And what we did was -- the purpose was several. One is to get Vince and I a little bit more familiar with the assets. Two is to categorize redevelopment opportunities, or shall we say, value creation opportunities at every center. And then the third was to look at what assets we might want to dispose of based on quality, location, compounded growth rates or whatever. So towards that end we have got a list of redevelopment, of value creation ideas for every center that we will be implementing over the course of the year. And then in the sales category, as you all know, we sold Upstate New York. That was sold for the mid-eight cap rate. So when you combine what we have sold in New York plus everything else we have done this year the overall cap rate for these sales have been in the 7.5 range. I did not go to the New York asset simply because they were under contract, but I kind of believe, that they were, based on everything we were told here, and looking at them internally that they were clearly on the lower end of our portfolio. We hope and we are planning on having another $250 million to $300 million, either sold or certainly under contract by our next conference call. We are now focused on some of our secondary markets, and I believe that the cap rates we are looking at will be between 7 and 7.5, on those assets that we are looking to sell, probably not only in the next $250 million to $300 million, but probably that will be the average throughout the course of 2017. Our goal is to get down to a debt-to-EBITDA of around 6.0, and the phrase we are using here internally is we want to do it in an orderly, disciplined, but timely fashion. So number one, get it done. But let's be disciplined enough so that we take a little extra time if necessary to make sure we get good pricing on each sale and don't become a forced seller. Moving on to our joint ventures, I want to really talk about two of them. First is Ballroom. That's with Blackstone. We've a 5% interest, 55 assets worth about $2 billion. As most of you we don't have control over that, Blackstone does. We understand they were in the market, attempting to be selling it. Again we just don't have the timing on that. We have -- do not have any interest in buying any of those assets. Our interest in addition to, probably about $100 million of equity, is the $300 million or so of preferreds we have at 8.5%. We created the sugar high for ourselves with this high-yielding preferred, and it's going to come off at some point. I just don't know at this point. I can't give you any timing as to exactly when that will happen. Manatee is another joint venture I did want to mention. It's 20%, we have 20% ownership. Again it also has about 55 assets. It's in the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range, which means our interest is $240 million to $280 million. That is in the market now. Initial bids are due in the next couple of weeks. There is a very, very active groups looking at it. There are a couple that are looking at the entire portfolio, and there are numerous groups that are looking at different pieces of it. As all of you know we have a right of first refusal on that. And we have been approached by a number of different parties to team up with them in some way to buy, joint venture, some of these assets. I think at this point we are just sort of keeping all of our options open. I obviously realize it would be nice to take advantage somehow of this right of first refusal, but we also want to keep in mind that de-levering is a main goal we have for 2017. On the timing, I think a lot is going to depend upon how many buyers are ultimately selected to buy this property. If it's one, obviously it could be quicker. If there's multiple buyers it could take a little longer. A guess today, and it's just a guess, is that that the deal will be awarded to the various groups or one group by the end of the year and we should be looking at a late first-quarter early second quarter close. In Puerto Rico we have done all our analysis. We have been approached by several groups who are interested either in the entire or part of the portfolio. I am not sure as we stated today, if we will be able to transact on that. A lot will be depending upon the financing available to the potential buyers. I don't want to be a forced seller in this. So as we look at our goals for 2017 it does not include selling Puerto Rico. It would be nice if we could. It would nice if we reduce our exposure at a minimum. But again I don't want to be a forced seller, and I think at this point it's too early. So the next 90 days are very, very important for us. We need to fill some organizational holes. We will have some direction on new Board members. We think we will sell between $250 million and $300 million of assets. The joint ventures, at least Manatee I think maybe, won't be closed but at least we will know exactly where we are headed, and I think we will have a much better handle on Puerto Rico. So we are really focused on what we need to do to get this done and achieve our goals, but I think we are also spending a fair amount of time on looking at what do we like after all this is done in terms of our size, the quality of our portfolio, our balance sheet, compounded on the growth rate, and I will tell you as we look here in Cleveland we are pretty excited about what we can be. We owe you a detailed plan. What I'm calling phase two of our growth, as to how we get -- once we get our initial goals, how do we grow and who are we. We have delayed that. And I've delayed it for a couple reasons. One is that we got a lot of big things in the market right now, just we are trying to figure out organizationally, some big joint ventures, some asset sales. And secondly is when we are looking at bringing on some very senior retail real estate talent I would like to take advantage of their expertise, and their thoughts before we finalize a program that we have in terms of how we are going to look going forward. So we will get it to you but I want to be thoughtful on this and make sure we do it the right way. So with that I turn it over to Vince Corno.
Vincent A. Corno: Thank you, Tom. And good morning to everyone from the city of Cleveland, the home of one champion and hopefully in the next couple of weeks, a second champion here very shortly. Thank you all for joining today's call. I would like to start off, this is my first earnings call but I want to offer up my thanks to Paul Freddo for his continuing support and tutelage. I am pleased to say that the transition of leasing and development from Paul to me continues to be very smooth and orderly. Paul and I have been great friends and special colleagues for over 20 years, going back to our department store days, and I must say it's a true privilege to be on the same team. Tom, Paul and I spent the last quarter doing a deep dive into the DDR portfolio, as Tom mentioned in his opening comments. In August and September we conducted 10 days of portfolio reviews in which we looked at the operational status of most of DDR centers from coast-to-coast. We looked at the property's strengths, weaknesses and opportunities, did an in-depth Boardroom assessment of each center's market position, tenant lineup, site plan, financial performance among other things, and these were all led by our by our capable leasing professionals responsible for the individual assets. It also provided me an opportunity to spend time getting to know the team. Tom and I, as he mentioned, also visited a large number of DDR assets since the last call. We have been to Puerto Rico, Denver, Chicago, and Atlanta with more business to come. I must offer that every trip I come away even more energized by the high quality of the centers across the portfolio and the pride that we have here at DDR about the team and the assets. Across the board the centers that I saw, or have seen in the last 90 days are very vibrant, compelling and crowded shopping venues. After the time I spent on the job here, I can personally attest that both from the retail side of the table from my days at Dick's Sporting Goods and now with even more conviction, now that I am on this side of the table, that the people, the portfolio and the processes here are the best in the business. The fact that DDR's operations haven't skipped a beat despite some of the turmoil at the management level is a testimony to the quality and the depth of our company's resources. I'm on the record, I think with some of you saying that the team here is a well-oiled machine and we continue to produce without any exception in this quarter in that same vein. This dynamic allows us to focus on the more strategic initiatives that Tom outlined without a concern about the core business. So turning to the operating metrics for the third quarter, as Tom mentioned they were very strong, as strong as they had been for years. We posted a 3.4% increase in same-store NOI for the quarter on a pro rata basis with domestic NOI, which comprises 87% of our same-store pool, growing at a robust 3.6%. Puerto Rico same-store NOI was likewise up, 2.1% in the quarter. This was driven largely by expense control relative to the prior year. While the Sports Authority bankruptcy had a negative 70 basis point impact on the overall same-store NOI growth rate, this was offset by strong new and renewal spreads, reduced CAM expenses across the portfolio and increased overage rent. We expect both the Sports Authority bankruptcy and the more recent Golfsmith bankruptcy to continue to negatively weigh on same-store NOI results going into the fourth quarter and into the first half of next year. Nonetheless it does not impact or affect our 2016 full year same-store guidance of plus 2.5% to 3.5%. In addition to the strong same-store NOI results there are a few other call outs for your attention. During the quarter as Tom mentioned we executed over 300 new leases and renewals, for close to 3 million feet. Average year one rents on the new leases came in at $18.29 a foot. Spreads for the new deals were strong at 21.1% at pro rata share, inclusive of the Puerto Rico assets. If you take the Puerto Rico assets out, new deal spreads were plus 29.5%. Spreads on renewals were likewise strong, at a positive 8% pro rata and 8.9% without Puerto Rico. DDR's inflation rent per square foot increased by $0.44 or 3% for the quarter. The completed sale or disposition of the Upstate New York portfolio removed subpar rents averaging around $11.00 a square foot from the portfolio and significantly boosted this metric. Since the third quarter of 2015, in place rents have increased nearly 6% on the entire portfolio. This is principally through strong new and re-leasing spreads, as well as disclosing of lower growth and lower rent assets. Year-to-date the average compound annual growth rate on new leases is 1.4%. This is an improvement over the 100 to 125 basis points that we have historically achieved. Despite having a portfolio comprised of over 75% anchor space, we continue to focus on achieving annual bumps in new leases to drive future same store growth on small shop spaces as well as pushing anchors on mid-term bumps up at least 10% every five years. As we all know built in rent increases set the stage for healthy growth in future years. This is despite our consistently very high leased rate and the initiative remains a key priority for our team. Our lease rate for the quarter ended up at 95.4% at DDR's pro rata share. This is 70 basis points below last quarter and primarily due to the nine wholly-owned Sports Authority stores in our portfolio that were rejected in bankruptcy. The decrease in the lease rate was partially offset by the continued improvement in the small shop lease rate which now stands at 89.9%, a 40 basis point improvement over last quarter and 140 basis point improvement annually. We continue to work through the Sports Authority bankruptcy and remain very pleased with the demand for our vacant boxes. Dick's Sporting Goods and T.J. Maxx assumed three of our 12-wholly owned locations without an interruption in the rent stream. In the case of the two locations assumed by Dick's at Perimeter Point in Atlanta and Midtown Miami, we recently signed lease amendments that reset those deals with a new 10 year base term, tenant allowance at higher rent. We are at leased or letter of intent for six additional Sports Authority boxes that we expect to open in the second half of 2017, all at positive spreads. Dick's, T.J. Maxx, Ulta, Specialty Grocery and Gym Users are the front runners for these spaces. All said we are on the path to having three quarters of our Sports Authority exposure resolved in the near term with better retailers, at better rents. As you know another sporting retailer, Golfsmith filed for bankruptcy since our last call and is in the process of liquidating. DDR has six wholly owned Golfsmith locations, all of which are in prime plus or prime centers. Golfsmith represents 30 basis points of DDR's annual base rent and occupies premises in the 20,000 to 35,000 foot square range. We have received word that Dick's Sporting Goods intends to assume and operate two of the six locations, both in prime plus centers, one in Denver, one in Phoenix and they will retain designation rights for the balance of the Golfsmith portfolio. The remaining four locations are located in two prime plus and two prime centers at slightly below market rents. We believe this provides DDR good opportunity to increase both the rent and the NAV at these centers by backfilling with better and stronger retailers in the event that Dick's elects to reject the leases. In any event we are confident that we will achieve successful and accretive solutions for the remaining locations. I am pleased to report that in Puerto Rico we had a great H&M opening at our Del Sol property in the quarter. And the island's first Dave & Buster's is on schedule to open next summer on the Del Sol food court. We continue to work hard to build and maintain the retail lineup of our [Indiscernible] dominant portfolio. With that said however our Puerto Rico business continues to underperform as compared to the consistently strong results of our Mainland U.S. assets. Same-store rental revenue was a diluted plus 0.4%, which is consistent with the flattish trends of past quarters. Spreads on renewals signed this quarter were a negative 4%. The weak spreads are largely due to tenant roll downs necessary to maintain the current leased rate of approximately 93%. We remain laser focused on maintaining and enhancing occupancy in our Puerto Rico centers with credit worthy tenants in the face of the commonwealth's economic and political headwinds. I would also like to briefly touch on our redevelopment pipeline. As part of my DDR indoctrination we did a detailed evaluation by property of the existing pipeline and potential opportunities. Based on this review I am confident that we'll be able to continue to deliver at least $100 million of redevelopment projects annually at returns in the high single-digits. This quarter alone we transferred $31 million of development and redevelopment construction work in process to active status. The majority of this came from our stabilized development in Guilford, Connecticut and $12 million from the expansion of our Belgate Crossings project in Charlotte where a T.J. Maxx and Burlington were placed into service in Q3. We have identified multiple wholly owned assets with major redevelopment potential and I will provide updates in the coming months. Before I finish my comments I would like to address some industry commentary concerning a potential glut of vacant department store supply that may soon hit the market and the impact that it may have on power centers. I start by saying that I'm a big believer in the power center format over other retail formats. And after spending 20 years in the department store business I only point to my choice to join DDR as a pretty good indicator of my level of personal conviction. Plain and simple of all retail formats power centers are best positioned to adapt to the consumers' rapidly changing shopping habits and demands. This is especially true in the face of e-commerce disruption to the bricks and mortar business and the retail industry's movement toward an omni-channel environment. We are witnessing an evolution of the physical store. In addition to its traditional function as a retail shopping venue the retail box is becoming a much more important and integral part of a retailer's distribution network. Innovations like click-&-collect, and buy online, ship from store are transformational. The changing role of the box favors our power center format over others. A power center has a distinct advance in its simplicity and convenience. Our centers are typically smaller in scale and easier to navigate, yet located in the same super regional retail nodes as our mall brethren. The physical configuration is generally rectilinear and easily accommodating to retailers' changing prototypes and sizes. With convenient surface parking right at the front door, the consumer can get in and out in an easy and efficient manner as compared to malls. Moreover our centers are much less complex when it comes to overarching legal limitations contained in easement agreements. I have personally been involved in multiple instances when a mall owner pursues repurposing a department store box only to be blocked by a third-party under an REA or city approval. Breaking up the department store box for multiple users is often times a cost prohibitive proposition, especially if it requires a downsize or consolidation of an existing occupant or a significant initial outlay to control the real estate. Perhaps the most important advantage of our model, power centers are for occupancy cost efficiencies with rent in common area and charges that are dwarfed by comparable mall economics. While these attributes in many respects are stating the obvious I think it is important that we emphasize them in response to a suggestion that there may be tenant flight risk. All said, I think the proof is in the pudding, as we count among our largest tenants many of the strongest and best in class retailers in the business. This is not a coincidence. We are dedicated to curating a synergistic retail line up in our centers to provide our retailers and their customers the most compelling and convenient shopping environment. As a veteran retailer I will tell you that co-tenancy matters and at DDR we have the retailers that people want and the format that people want. In fact the retail community is telling us this. We have only been approached recently by a number of highly regarded mall-based retailers seeking opportunity in our centers. They are telling us that their customers are telling them that they prefer the retail mix and convenience of power centers. While some may advocate the plausibility of redeploying vacant department store space for use by power center-based retailers, there are significant and real hurdles to achieving this. Nonetheless we see view potential competition in the form of an empty department store box no differently than we would view any other competitive real estate on the market. As with all competition we have and will continue to monitor and aggressively address competitive risks to our portfolio. If there is a shuttered or soon-to-be vacant box in any one of our markets that is competitive with our real estate, regardless of whether it is in a mall, a power center or grocery-anchored center or freestanding you can be sure that we will be on it just as we always have. In fact we have already surveyed every center in our portfolio and have identified properties with a Sears, Kmart and/or Macy's within five miles. In each of those centers we weighed the flight risk of each anchor tenant greater than 10,000 feet with a lease expiration in the next five years. Our initial assessment under very conservative assumptions is only about 2% of our approximate 1,000 anchor tenants in our wholly owned portfolio, which affects 13 centers, poses a theoretical flight risk. Obviously we will be working on eliminating or reducing those risks as we move forward. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Christa.
Christa A. Vesy: Thank you, Vince. For the third quarter operating FFO was $120.6 million or $0.33 per share which represents a 6% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items FFO for the quarter was $120.1 million, also $0.33 per share. Non-operating items primarily consisted of approximately $500,000 of transactional and debt extinguishment costs. As Vince mentioned the quarter benefited from strong same-store NOI growth through our consistent new and renewal leasing spread as well as through expense reduction. During the third quarter we also recorded approximately $105 million of impairment charges, due almost exclusively to the change in the holding period and probabilities of sale related to assets in our current disposition pipeline. While we clearly remain sensitive to impairing assets these charges were triggered by management and the Board's decision to move forward with additional asset sales in an effort to achieve new deleveraging goals. While the prior strategy targeted a pro rata debt-to-EBITDA figure of approximately seven times, the current team sees the need for additional deleveraging to a figure of at least six times, if not further. While we're very comfortable with our position in terms of the size of the unencumbered asset pool, debt duration, EBITDA stream, lack of development and international exposure, we no longer find it acceptable to be an outlier on debt-to-EBITDA. We are committed to a year of capital raising through additional asset pruning in 2017 for de-levering as we pursue rating upgrades to benefit our cost of capital going forward. Next, I would like to provide an update on our transactional progress. We closed on the sale of 25 assets totaling $457 million of DDR share in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter to date including the sale of the portfolio of assets located primarily in upstate New York. Asset sales closed year-to-date and under contract to close in 2016 total approximately $839 million at our share and are inline with our revised disposition guidance of $700 million to $900 million and carry a weighted average cap rate of approximately 7.5%. We also closed on the acquisition of one asset in Portland, Oregon for $87 million, increasing our concentration in the market to four assets. We are also under contract to acquire a grocery anchored power center in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago before year end. Both of these acquisitions were in process prior to the management change and with these transactions we will be inline with our original acquisition guidance of approximate $250 million, all of which will be fully funded with disposition proceeds. Regarding modeling items we continue to anticipate the full wind down of our co-mingled joint venture, the DDR Domestic Retail Fund by the first quarter of 2017. We have a 20% interest in the 55 assets held in the fund and we collect approximately $12 million of management fee income from the venture annually. I would like to highlight that we do have a right of first refusal on the portfolio that provides us significant rights with respect to the ultimate disposition of the joint venture assets. Consequently we are continuing to analyze various scenarios that will allow us to maximize the benefit from our ROFR. Additionally our Blackstone three joint venture which acquired the former ARCP portfolio could also be wound down over the course of 2017 as mentioned by Tom. While the timing is not clear we do not expect that we'll maintain an equity ownership or benefit from the interest income associated with approximately $294 million of preferred equity for the entire year in 2017. I would also like to note that the preferred equity line item on our balance sheet has been renamed receivable preferred equity interest, to underscore that the $400 million balance related to both of the Blackstone joint ventures will be returned to us in full following the sale of all the joint venture's assets. This change was initially made in the fourth quarter of 2015. However, we continue to see this receivable will balance missed in our NAV calculations. Finally while we are not yet providing guidance for 2017 I would like to draw your attention to the approximately 70 basis point spread between the cash and gap interest rates on our 2017 consolidated debt maturity. This spread causes interest on the income statement to be expensed at an artificially low rate which results in an increase in GAAP related earnings metrics, including FFO per share. This spread is disclosed in footnote four, debt fair value amortization in the quarterly supplement. Following the repayment of 2017 maturities the balance is expected to be reduced by 40% to 50%. I would also like to discuss changes in our supplemental disclosure this quarter. As you know the SEC has updated its interpretive guidance regarding the use of non-GAAP measures including pro rata financial disclosures. We have revised the presentation of our financial statements and our quarterly financial supplements in accordance with the SEC's guidance. However we will continue to provide the pro rata information consistent with prior quarters to ensure accurate and seamless modeling. Pro rata balances necessary for modeling can be found on page 16 in the third quarter supplement. Finally due to strong operational results and given the delay in the closing of the portfolio located primarily in Upstate New York we expect to exceed the high end of our full-year operating FFO guidance range of $1.23 to $1.26 per share, and are therefore revising guidance to a range of $1.26 to $1.28 per share representing 3% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. These disposition proceeds should allow us to achieve a pro rata debt-to-EBITDA figure below seven times by year-end and we will look to further lower this metric to a figure closer or better than our peer group. However given the moving pieces regarding our future transactional strategy we will not be providing additional guidance on 2017 numbers on this call. We do look forward to updating you on next year's results in early 2017 consistent with our past practice. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Goldfarb from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alex Goldfarb: Good morning. Good morning out there. Just a question, Tom, you brought up the Board and you brought up the two replacement board members. Given the history that DDR's been [ph] a stand out with basically a dysfunction between management and the Board, I know you guys are looking for a replacement for you as an independent, to get a new independent. So the two Board members you are talking about, are these going to be two of the five who have been there for over 10 years, in addition to you or it's just two in general, and as part of that can you talk about making sure that going forward there is more alignment between the Board and management, because clearly that's been -- there is an overhang on the prior management and it's just been something that makes DDR a standout, which it shouldn't be.
Thomas F. August: Thank you for the question, Alex. First of all I would like to say that my relationship with the Board is good. So I'm not going to discuss history. History, all I can tell you is the Board has been very supportive, as I have thought about what we want to do in terms of the deleveraging and JVs. That's number one. Number two. I think what we are thinking of us right now is first let's add to the Board. We are pretty short on committees, I mean, the ability to fill the committees. So we are looking for two to add and I'm sure that the Board once we get these people on board will be addressing Board rotation in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hi. It's Michael, and Christy is on the phone with me as well. Tom, you have effectively described DDR as a show me story. Show me all the stuff that you are doing and then ultimately it should be reflected. What is the appropriate amount of time that you expect the market to give you to execute against this plan, and I guess at what point given the progress you are making and where the stock trades would you encourage the Board to consider strategic alternatives? Obviously the stock being at the mid-$15 today, down from $20 in the summer is back to 2012 levels, sizable discount to the current NAV. I guess at what point does it make sense to run a dual track process rather than wait?
Thomas F. August: Well, right now Michael I can tell you my focus is just on fixing the fundamentals of the company. They are not focused on strategic alternatives. I think my mandate from the Board has been fix what we need to fix in terms of our leverage, in terms of our focus, in terms of our joint ventures and then let's see where we stand after that. So I think that when you look at the next quarter we are projecting substantial noticeable improvement. It's not getting us all the way there but $250 million of assets sold, another 250, additions to the board, additions to management team. So we think we are making significant progress on a quarter to quarter basis. That's really what my focus is today.
Operator: Next question comes from Jay Carlington from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Jay Carlington: Good morning. So tom what does the hiring of a CEO, President kind of mean in terms of your role and time frame at the company, because maybe there was an assumption you would be there for the next couple of years. So has that thought process changed at all?
Thomas F. August: So maybe I misspoke or maybe you hopefully didn't hear me right. We are talking about hiring a President or CEO, -- excuse me a President or COO.
Jay Carlington: Okay.
Thomas F. August: So obviously what we want to do is hire some really qualified retail experienced person and that person will hopefully along with others, either in the company or additional hires be in a position to take my place at some point. Now whether that's three years, five years, two. I don't know. Obviously we want to get the right person in here to help us with this turnaround.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Vince, maybe you could talk a little bit more about Puerto Rico and the demand that you are seeing down there. It sounds like renewals were down. I'm just wondering is there any new activity and I guess how much of a price discount do you have to give people in order to get them to either stay in current space or to kind of manage through the sales declines?
Vincent A. Corno: Candidly, it's a difficult environment down there. A lot of the tenants that are rolling are requesting significant rent reductions to stay on board. What we are doing is positioning the asset so that we are not locking in at these lower rents for the longer term because we do believe that will be opportunity down the road. But I would tell you that it is an environment where in order to maintain a 93% leased rate we are having to make concessions to tenants that are rolling.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Tom, I understand that you don't want to be a forced seller in Puerto Rico, but you laid out a target of reducing leverage to six times debt-to-EBITDA which includes quite a bit of disposition activity to get leverage to that level. If you don't sell Puerto Rico and you end up selling other assets instead, are you comfortable owning that portfolio as a larger exposure within DDR?
Thomas F. August: Well I think the preference would be to at least reduce our exposure there but again we are going to be faced with the choice and then I'm sure we will get some sort of offer and we decide it is appropriate for us to sell it now or hold it a little bit longer. Again our preference would be to reduce our exposure somewhat but we don't want to get too far in front of ourselves where we are forced to take a deal that just doesn't make any economic sense.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Could you just help recap your disclosure program? I know you said you are looking to sell 250 or 300 more in the fourth quarter. I am guessing that excludes the JV asset sales. So in totality what is the range of the activity that we should expect from DDR next year? And the second tied to that Puerto Rico when we look at the year-over-year change in the ABR for a top five assets it seems like it was down 1.6%. Just curious how you expect to get some reasonable pricing when NOI is going negatively?
Vincent A. Corno: Let us start. I think we are targeting 250 to 300 for the next quarter. In those numbers we're not assuming anything for any of our joint venture or the two joint ventures that I referred to which would be the Manatee and the Volvo. And I think the second question, I think we were flat not down.
Thomas F. August: Yes. Puerto Rico, Ki Bin, in terms of the sales model, one that is based on an annualized quarter lease ABR. So it's not overly comparable quarter over quarter, when you are looking at individual assets, so there could be seasonality involved in there and just the annualization. So as Vince mentioned we were roughly flat in terms of ABR growth in Puerto Rico.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys talk a bit about the full year same-store NOI guidance. You left it untouched here. We have got 60 days left in the year. I'm curious why you haven't narrowed it. It implies a 4Q same store NOI basically 0% to 2% which clearly a big drop off from recent quarters. Are you being conservative here given your concern over Sports Authority and Golfsmith as you mentioned earlier and as part of that can you talk about what you're expecting from them? And any other potential tenant issues that are maybe emerging or factoring into your thinking, and can you weave in some thoughts on the big jump in the lease termination fees this quarter as well?
Thomas F. August: As to the same-store NOI roll forward I would tell you that going forward we don't expect it to be on the high end of the range. Fourth quarter will probably be on the lower end of the range that we have guided. The TSA impact and the Golfsmith impact obviously will take some of the luster off of the recent performance. As to the TSA and the Golfsmith locations, as I mentioned in my comments we are in the process of redeploying those assets. We have three already resolved. We have six that will be up and running in the middle of next year. With the Golfsmith it is really still too early to tell. But certainly with respect to the guidance that we provided to-date we expect it to be on the lower end of the guidance in the fourth quarter.
Vincent A. Corno: And on the term fee question and driven mostly by a deal with Game Stop on multiple locations. That's what drove the big number in the third quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Metz from UBS. Please go ahead.
Jeremy Metz: Hey guys. Tom, I want to follow up on Michael's question earlier on how DDR has been this next year's story for the past few years. You guys took up your disposition targets again which will further dampen 2017 earnings, paring back Puerto Rico is obviously still a priority. So I'm wondering how confident you are that next year will be the turning point here and then what sort of earnings growth rate do you think is realistic for the company from there?
Thomas F. August: Going forward, I'm not sure about that. I will tell you for the next year assuming the market conditions stay kind of where they are now I think we are going to be hitting our goal. I think, just giving you an example, I think in New York we got kind out in front of ourselves telling you it was done before it was really done and I think we want to be cautious here and make sure we can deliver. We are really confident about the next quarter. I would suggest that we think we are going to be able to get our goals by the end of the year. If it takes us an extra quarter or so, so be it. But that is sort of where we are. In terms of the -- I know you are all waiting and you deserve, what do we look like afterwards. We are pretty close to finalizing that but again we are hopefully going to bringing in some senior retail talent pretty quickly and I would like to have them put their finishing touches on it before we sort of tell the market. We only -- when I started my conversation, we are a show me company. We are not trust me. I don't want to start saying things we can't deliver. So I want to be a little bit cautious and take a little bit longer than I normally might.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hoglund from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: Hi, I appreciate the color on the potential vacancies that might come to the market from department stores. I'm wondering what's DDR's point of view in terms of the retail environment heading into 2017 in terms of how might the level of vacancies and bankruptcies be relative to 2016. And if management does have a view on the likelihood we do see a lot of department store vacancies?
Thomas F. August: I think in terms of the retail trends that we are seeing out there, I would say that the winning concepts are really in the off-price sector, the Ross, the Burlington's. We are also seeing specialty grocers, home improvements, restaurants, fitness, entertainment, all of those categories are showing signs of growth. As to the industry segments that are losing market share and showing a little strain that would be department stores, full price apparel, obviously office supplies and electronics. As to our portfolio, I would tell you that we do business and count among our largest tenants some of the success stories in the industry, the darlings of the industries if you will; the TJXs, the Dick's, the Ross, the Ultas, the PetSmarts of the world are in our centers. They are all showing strong signs of growth. In the case of Ulta in the second quarter they were up 14%. By and large across the board the tenants that I just mentioned are all showing positive comps as compared to other retailers. So we are optimistic about the holiday season, about the potential for our centers and the tenants in our centers. We look at it as a real opportunity for us to continue to grow our same-store NOI and our tenants will continue to show positive comps.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Yes, hey. Tom, just in terms of some of the executive searches that are going on right now plus the potential to add a President and COO, one, just curious how we should be thinking about G&A as we head into 2017 but then also below that executive level, is the transition phase or the turnover that you are seeing in that second layer, is that largely complete at this point or do you expect some additional changes below the executive level?
Thomas F. August: I think the G&A will move up slightly. If you all recall I think we had a $10 million reduction from 2014 to 2015. So there will be clearly a slight uptick depending upon how many and the expense of these people we are bringing on. My guess is it will probably not be -- it will be still less than it was two or three years ago. And I think what we have done is -- you would guess when I was named CEO there was a certain amount of instability here, feeling, people just nervous. I think with that the longer I am here the more stability we have gotten, and I think we are putting in place incentive programs for people to really show them the value of staying here at DDR. So I don't think there is going to be much more turnover at the lower level as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Hi. I was wondering are you expecting another year of heavy asset sales in 2017 above the JV inline similar to what we are seeing here, and if there is anyway can you throw out some rough parameters? And secondly I know you mentioned the 2017 cap rates would be about 7.5%. Curious how much of overall 7.5% product is in the overall portfolio to be sold at some point?
Thomas F. August: I think that we probably have the first part of our sales program is going to be at the 7.5 range, the first half maybe. Certainly the next $250 million to $300 million will be in that category.
Matthew A. Lougee: Michael, it's Matt. I would add that obviously in terms of dispositions for next year we have not quantified that in terms of guidance, although with Tom's remarks I think whatever you can back into mathematically I'm getting to roughly a term lower. It's probably the right net sales number in terms of cap rates. Mid-sevens is probably what we have left in the portfolio. I mean the New York stuff was the worst of the worst. And so that cap rate print I think would be on the high end of anything else we would sell going forward. So I think from a modeling perspective I think you continue to see a seven handle on those.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carol Kemple from Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Carol Kemple: Good morning. On the income statement operating and maintenance expense was down quite a bit over last year. Was there anything that led to that decline just besides you have sold assets?
Christa A. Vesy: No. I would say generally speaking there was maybe a bit of outsized spending in 2015 compared to 2016. We did have lower expenses across the portfolio both in Puerto Rico and domestically. In Puerto Rico we did experience some savings on the utility front side, just due to benefit of lower rates. But I would say it wasn't necessarily part of some sort of a formal program.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Boenning. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Great. Good morning. A question on your net effective rents. Could you maybe talk about why the net effective rents appear to have dropped by $1, a $1.5 relative to previous quarters and why you're CapEx is picking up a little bit?
Paul W. Freddo: Yes, Floris. This is Paul. One it's a function of several things and obviously the starting rent has something to do with where we end up on net effective rent, and they were slightly lower than the prior two quarters but still a strong number. I don't want -- that starting rent on new deals of $18.91 is something we feel very good about. It is not the same number as the other two quarters but well head of about 20% north of our average base rent in the portfolio. So you are always going to see some choppiness in the starting rent based on the character of the deals we make in a quarter. In this quarter and in terms of some of the cost, I think it is always important to remember we are including everything in that cost part of this equation, landlord work, tenant allowance, commissions. I'm not sure that's the way it is being reporting by everybody else but we have got it all in, and in this quarter we happen to have a couple of deals that, the demise and split of one of our Sports Authority, boxes out in LA, in the LA market, great comps but a costly deal and also a new specialty grocery we did backfilling, that we will be in HH Greg, again at a significant spread but costly. So a little higher costs this quarter. No trend that concerns us at all as we look at the capital we are putting into the deal.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Good morning. This is Ronald Kamdem on Richard Hill's line. Just a quick one for me. Talking, looking at the dispositions that you have mentioned for 4Q and assuming that the Manatee and Ballroom goes through, can you just remind us that the end of 2017 where does that put you in terms of assets and obviously you spent a lot of time going through and walking through the portfolio. When you are thinking about longer-term and the disproportionate amount that comes from your top 50 assets, longer-term view where do you think could be an ideal asset base for the company? Thanks.
Thomas F. August: I think that if we do what we say we are going to do and the two joint ventures wind up we will be at around 200 assets. And I just want to remind everybody that several years ago it was 850. When I first started two or three or four months ago it was 350. So it is a significant drop. I think one of the things that is getting lost in a lot of this is that as you can tell by the cap rates, we are selling the lower quality stuff. So I think the quality of the portfolio will be much better. I'm hoping that once all this noise with the management issues get settled that people start to focus on the real estate and the quality that we have created over the last few years. I don't think we have set a goal in terms of number of assets. I think that our goal is really quality and growth rate going forward. And we just got into a little bit of trouble when we started buying these the big, big portfolios with several hundred assets and disposing of the bottom pieces has taken us a lot longer than we thought it was going to do it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi. Good morning. It is Christy here as Michael. Just to be clear on the timing regarding Michael's question. You mentioned that you have a lot going on in the next 90 days. Is that the timeframe after which you might start to explore some more strategic things to demonstrate to the market a discount to NAV? And then, just on Puerto Rico, you mentioned sales are somewhat dependent on financing. Would you consider providing seller financing to get deals done?
Thomas F. August: I think what I told Michael is my focus right now is on improving the overall quality of DDR from a balance sheet asset perspective and then adding some new people from a new organization. I don't think I addressed -- and if I did I shouldn't have. We are seeking strategic alternatives. I have not said that at all. What we are doing is just fixing what we have today. We think that we will be in great shape once we do that. I can't remember the second. It was several questions in there. Seller financing, I think -- again I think what we have said it's a little too early to tell where we are with about Puerto Rico. We would like to reduce our exposure. We will do something that's economically advantageous to us and nothing more than that. We will keep all of our options open with respect to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Please go ahead.
Paul Morgan: Hi, good morning. I am curious you said you were out in the markets touring the assets over the past quarter or so. What your takeaways are, the prior management had set, kind of clear demarcation prime plus, prime and had a view on kind of where the cutoff was. Now you have implied dispositions going forward to get to your new leverage hurdle. I mean does that -- do you think that the asset sales that are implied by that are going kind of cut into what we used to think of as the prime portfolio? Do you think that was the right quality bar to set and kind of anything -- any color that's related to kind of what you saw recently?
Vincent A. Corno: I think that we would be selling the lower quality in secondary markets. I think that's what our goal is. I think when I look back at my predecessors, Dan and David, I think that was their philosophy too. I think that in fact the quality has improved dramatically. Appropriately the other issues with the company have overshadowed. People are really looking at the real estate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Yes. Good morning everybody. Tom, thanks for a good overview of your immediate goals. I guess the one question I had relates to sort of the organizational structure that will be reporting to you, say six months or whenever the executive level positions that you are currently looking for get filled. Can you give me a sense as to what that looks like? Who are the people that were reporting to you and what their responsibilities will be?
Thomas F. August: At a minimum there will be all of the corporate functions which will be the CAO, the CFO, the General Counsel, potentially the CIO. Depending upon what role -- obviously the leasing and development and depending upon who we bring in, it could be have some operational people reporting to that new person. I think until we actually hire the person and understand the skill set that we are bringing in, deciding reporting requirements at this time is just a little too difficult for me right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tammy Fique from Wells Fargo.
Tamara Fique: Hi. Just following up on Paul's question maybe a little differently, asking a little differently. Following the recent portfolio reviews and looking at property strengths and weaknesses, I am just sort of curious, these broad portfolio reviews have been done a number of time over the last few years. So how is this review different versus prior reviews in terms of what specifically you were looking for and how were you thinking about redevelopment yield thresholds?
Thomas F. August: I am going to take the first part and I will turn it over to Paul or Vince for the second part. The portfolio views are really different because three or four years ago they were looking at 850 assets with a totally different quality and locational range than what I did this time, which was 350 assets, really 335 since New York was pretty much done. My review was of a much more focused and higher-quality portfolio than might have been conducted three or four years ago.
Paul W. Freddo: As to the redevelopment pipeline I think we feel very confident that we should be able to support at level of at least $100 million a year and the yields on that should be in the high single-digits. There is a lot to work within the existing portfolio. Be it an out parcel, be it repurposing vacant stores. But certainly I think that that's a pretty low threshold and should be able to sustain that level.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
35,SITC,4,2016,2017-02-14 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the DDR Corp. Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meghan Finneran. Please go ahead.
Meghan Finneran: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call you will hear from President and CEO, Tom August; Executive Vice President of Leasing and Development, Vince Corno; and Executive Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim CFO, Christa Vesy. Please be aware that certain of our statements today maybe forward-looking. Although we believe such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, you should understand that these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.DDR.com. Last, we will be observing a one question limit during the Q&A portion of our call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. At this time it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom August.
Thomas August: Thank you. Good morning everybody and thanks for listening into our fourth quarter conference call. I’m going to give a brief summary of our 2016 results and really spend a few minutes on the progress we've made and the strategic objectives we've outlined in the last conference call. Vince will review the operational results and discuss the status of the retail environment, and then Christa will discuss our financial performance and our 2017 guidance. Before I start, Paul Freddo was in the room with us today and I'd like to thank him for his service to DDR. As many of you know he will be stepping aside at the end of the month. He's been here nine years. He's been an extraordinary contributor and leader to the company. He has done a great job with Vince on the transition and we will miss him. So Paul on behalf of all of us at DDR, thank you very much. Let me get on to our 2016 performance. It's been an active year and I think overall it's been pretty solid. We've leased over 9 million square feet of space including Puerto Rico when I give all these numbers, it will include Puerto Rico. Our new leasing spreads have been in excess of 20%. Our renewal leasing has been 7.5%. Our occupancy - we ended the year at 95% which was slightly down and that was caused by the TSA bankruptcy, Vince is going to touch on that and how we’re doing in releasing those boxes in a few minutes. Our average base rent was up almost 5% and our same-store was up 3%. We’ve sold over $133 million worth of assets that included 50 income producing properties and nine pieces of land, so pretty active. I think what we all know is that the fourth quarter slowed down a little bit and that was due to our Puerto Rico situation and bankruptcies. Let me focus now on strategic objectives we had. On the last call which is I guess late October or November, we talked about five things that we really needed to address. Number one, was additions to the Board. If you remember I outlined that we have only five independent Board members and committee assignments were kind of tough, so we needed to add a couple and we wanted to add people with a diverse background, a different perspective from those that are currently on the Board and the management team and I’m pleased to say as many of hopefully have seen in our press release recently, we added Jane DeFlorio. She joined us last week's Board meeting. Her background is in capital markets and retail which is different from others on the Board so I think she is going to be a great addition to the team and we're really delighted that she was able to join the board and look forward to her contributions going forward. We are looking for a second Board member, that process is well underway and I hopefully will be able to announce another Board member certainly by our next conference call which is in the beginning of May of this year. On the management side, as we all know Vince joined us in July. He has gotten up to speed remarkably quickly and is providing us with that retail expertise that we would have lost with Paul's leading the company. So on the retail front I think we are in good shape. Bill Ross joined us as COO in January. Bill is going to be focusing on our strategic initiatives and asset management giving his back on McKenzie, General Electric and [Forced City] [ph] where he headed up the asset management program. We are delighted to have Bill on the team as well. We need to round up the management team, as with the Board's search that process is well underway and I should be making an announcement shortly hopefully by the end of the quarter if not sooner on how we feel about the management organization. Next was our joint ventures. What we wanted to do is we like joint ventures, it help us with our cost of capital but we need to find a partner whose business objectives were more consistent with ours and I think on the Manatee joint venture we have done that. That deal has been awarded. It is under letters of intent. It not yet firm or closed certainly so I can't go into too much details let me just say you that we found a longer term investor who will be buying out the 80% interest owned by the limited partners. DDR will have the opportunity to stay in as a 20% general partner. Our debt will go down slightly through asset sales and as currently structured, our fee stream will be extended certainly longer term and our rights of first refusal will stay in place. I want to spend a minute on this because this was one of the things we struggled on because one of our objective is to simplify our structure, our strategy and really reduce quote unquote [indiscernible] but we decided that this was a good deal for us to go forward with, one, because we had a partner whose business objective is similar to our always. Secondly, it didn't really reduce our leverage a lot by selling this because of the - we only own 20% and the fee stream would go away. Thirdly on a positive side, the fee stream is now been converted from a shorter term which was going to end in May or June to somewhat longer and I think the most important thing from our perspective is by retaining all of the rights of first refusal. There are a number of assets some of them are power centers, some of them are grocery centers but they are in markets we know, their assets we like and I think when our leverage gets a little bit more acceptable levels this will provide us an opportunity to grow. So overall this was a good deal for us and that’s why it was a rationale so moving ahead with it. On ballroom that is our joint venture with Blackstone. There is really not a lot to say on that. We’ve sold three smaller assets. We have a couple more under contract but we received no indication from Blackstone and their intention to sell a portfolio or close out this investment. As you know, we are a 5% equity partner, we provided $300 million with the preferred. Our Blackstone is managing general partners so we are just really following their lead on this. The fourth and probably the one we spent the most timeline and is certainly the biggest for us is our leverage. As you know we had a goal of reducing our debt to EBITDA to 6.0 hopefully by the end of this year. Before I tell you about our activity, let me just give you a very brief outlook on what we are seeing in the market. We are not selling our prime plus assets but given the number of people know we are trying to deleverage. We received a number of inbound calls and our perception is that there is little change in cap rate environment on any assets in any market probably in the mid-5s. There is still a lot of money out there but what we've seen is it's spreads have widened 50 to 100 basis points for B assets and/or B markets. We’re seeing a lot of activity if there is some sort of value added plate anything we’re selling whether it be redeveloping, reposition or re-tenanting space. Buyers want to feel that they at least have an ability to have some upside potential. The market is more limited for stabilized B assets in B markets. We’ve made significant progress on selling assets and I think on our last call I indicated I was hopeful that we have $250 million or so either under contract or sold by this meeting and again this is subsequent to the upstate New York sale which was for $390ish million. Since the Q3 we now have $335 million either under contract or sold since that day at mid 7 cap rate. Additionally we have approximately $225 million to $250 million of assets under letter of intent. Now I will caution you obviously there is a long way from a letter of intent to a contact to sale but I just want to give you sort of an idea of the activity level where we’re seeing. The cap rates on these new deals again are in the mid-7s and we've been selling assets either to get out of some markets where we don't see we have a longer-term future focusing on selling slower growth asset or upgrading the physical quality of the building. Our goal is to convert those assets that are under letter of intent and a couple more into contracts and in sales so we’re budgeting and hoping for another $250 million to $300 million of these assets sold or under contract by June 30. I’ve given you a bunch of numbers so let me just state this in a little bit different way. On 12/31/15 our debt-to-EBIT was 7.4 times. On 9/30/16 it was 7.1 times. 12/31/16 it was between 6.8 and 6.9. Given the $335 million under contract and closed that should take us down to 6.6 and our budget for midyear again with asset closed or under contract will be getting down to 6.4. So lots of progress, long way to go but lot of activity, we’ve got a lot of stuff in the market and I think we're on target to hit our goal hopefully by year end or shortly thereafter. The last strategic goal was Puerto Rico. We’ve made some progress but it has been slower than we had hoped. We have one group that is looking at the entire portfolio and we have several that are looking at different parts of the portfolio. All those groups indicate to us that before they could make a firm offer we needed to know what kind of debt was available for this type of assets in Puerto Rico at this time. So we spent the last two to three months working with investment bankers, brokers and rating agencies and we have received five, I think or six offers on debt financing. The quotes were approximately 60% leverage. Overall the spreads were good but obviously the gross interest rates have increased a little bit as interest rates have risen particularly since the election. So I think we're pleasantly surprised that we received five to six quotes for 60%ish loan-to-value on properties in Puerto Rico at this time. We have now just started to work with the potential buyers and seeing if we can convert those interests into offers and contracts. We’re not counting on these sales to meet our leverage goals but certainly would like to reduce our exposure to Puerto Rico. If the uncertainty on the island with the government oversight board with the new government down there produces poor offers then we’re prepared to sit and wait until conditions stabilize and improve. So summarizing on the strategic objectives on the Board one in place, one more to come. Hopefully we checked that box off by May. On the management side Vincent and Bill are in place look to complete the staffing on the management organization by the end of the quarter if not sooner. The JVs, Manatee should be close by the end of next Board call, or our next conference call. Clearly on the Blackstone we’re just waiting on that we're really following Blackstone's Lee and on Puerto Rico we’re just beginning to work with buyers so there is more to come on that. So with that in am going to turn it over to Vince.
Vincent Corno: Thank you, Tom. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining today's call. I’d like to start off by summarizing results for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2016 followed by our outlook and expectations for 2017 and then will finish with some commentary on the overall retail environment. DDR produced same-store NOI growth in the fourth quarter of plus 2% at pro rata share and plus 3% for the full year 2016. This is exactly at the midpoint of our original guidance of 2.5% to 3% for the full-year. Not surprising, fourth quarter same store NOI was pressured by the Sports Authority bankruptcy which cost 110 basis point drag in Puerto Rico which was down 1.1% same-store NOI for the quarter, an caused an additional 50 basis point drag. Excluding Sports Authority in Puerto Rico, same-store NOI actually exceeded our guidance at plus 3.6 for the quarter and plus 4.0 for the year. Our lease rate remains high at 95%, excluding Puerto Rico and retailer bankruptcies the lease rate is actually in excess of 96%. This highlights how well our domestic portfolio is performing and how we are now realizing the benefits of our concentrated efforts to upgrade the portfolio over the last couple of years. For the quarter we executed over 400,000 square feet of new leases and nearly 1.5 million square feet of renewals. This is consistent with the pace of prior quarters. For the year we leased more than 9 million square feet. New leasing spreads for the fourth quarter were up 21.3% and renewal spreads were plus 8.3% excluding Puerto Rico in both cases. The average rent on new deals for the year was more than $19 per square foot which exceeds our portfolio average by more than 20% and drove our overall rent per square foot to grow 4.7% year-over-year. We expect our overall rent per square foot to continue to grow in 2017 as our portfolio quality continues to strengthen principally through planned strategic divestitures. I'm also pleased to report another strong quarter of built-in new growth or built-in growth on new signed leases which was plus 1.4% for both the quarter and for the full-year 2016 and represents a 30 basis point increase over 2015. A follow-up on our Sports Authority stores. As I mentioned in the last call we have 12 wholly owned units, three of which we assumed in the bankruptcy process by Dick's Sporting Goods and T.J. Maxx of the remaining 9, 6 are at least in advance discussions with a list of retailers that include T.J., Dick's Sporting Goods Burlington, ULTA, Petco, Five Below, Hobby Lobby and Sprouts Farmers Market. We expect five of the 12 locations to commence rent in 2017 with the remainder in 2018 at blended positive spread over Sports Authorities rent in the 6% to 10% range. We're seeing similar success with Golfsmith with whom we had six wholly-owned stores. Dick’s Sporting Goods there assumed two leases in bankruptcy and we saw no interruption in the rent stream on those two deals. We have a committee approved dealer and a ongoing lease negotiation with a national high-end home decor outlet, and in another one of the empty stores a deposit of spread leaving three remaining locations all of which are the subject of active interest from the retail community. We will continue to update on our progress. As we target 2017, we remain very encouraged by the operating fundamentals of our domestic portfolio and expect deal volumes and economics to be on power with 2016 setting aside the impact of retailer bankruptcies in Puerto Rico. Our 1% to 2% same-store NOI guidance range outlined in yesterday's release accounts for continuing challenges in Puerto Rico and a possible wide-ranging contraction of the national junior box retailer on the low end of that range. Our 2017 shapes up as a transitional year for DDR. We have to staked our path to returning to same-store growth in the high 2%, low 3% range in 2018 and we are determined to capitalize on the transformational improvements that we have delivered and continue to deliver with our domestic portfolio. On balance, the portfolio quality is never been better and 2018 shows promising growth once we get our Sports Authority and Golfsmith spaces back online. I would also like to address our redevelopment pipeline. I personally visited many of our assets since I started last summer and continue to be encouraged by potential opportunities that we have to add value to our centers. In the fourth quarter we placed $16 million of construction and process into service at an 8% yield as Dick's Sporting Goods and Five Below opened up the Kenwood Square in Cincinnati. I would encourage everyone to see this redevelopment as it is a proud accomplishment for our company. We are on track to place an additional $80 million of CIP in the service over the course of 2017 and high single-digit yields roughly half of which is incremental to same-store NOI. This includes expansions at our recently opened Lee Vista Promenade in Orlando and Belgate Shopping Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are also on track to place into service Puerto Rico's first Dave & Buster's at Plaza del Sol that will open up in the fourth quarter of 2017. We continue to combo portfolio for major redevelopment opportunities and are actively pursuing projects at trophy assets like Shoppers World in Framingham, Massachusetts, Midtown Miami and Woodfield Village in Schaumburg Illinois. As everyone knows, the retail environment is going through a fundamental change, in 2017 we expect the disruption to continue. Nonetheless we believe that DDR's high quality power and grocery anchored centers are formats that are positioned not only to survive but to thrive in the new retail order that is unfolding. We're encouraged that many of our retail partners especially of price and discount are posting solid market share gains with comps in the plus mid-single digits and even higher. It is no secret that many retailers that favor power centers are benefiting from the fall out of the malls and the department stores. Grocery stores in our portfolio continue to do well and drive daily traffic to our centers, we feel very good about the strength of our retailers and certainly value the continued partnership. In additions to our compelling and industry-leading retail, convenience also sets us apart, our centers are manageably sized, they're easy to access with ready side surface parking at the retailers doorstep, we're finding that the American Shoppers more mission focused in our shopping trip and the ease of getting in and out is more important than ever. For the same reason, our centers are well suited to serve the evolving dual purpose role of Bricks and Mortar stores as both shopping venue and logistics distribution point, winning retailers working to perfect buy online pickup in store and buy online ship from store models and our real estate format is ideal for this adaptation. Having said that, I also acknowledge the challenges lie ahead since the beginning of the year, there have been multiple and notable retail bankruptcy filings and store closures but fortunate for DDR share owners, to date these bankruptcies will have no little or no effect on our portfolio. It is conceivable however that we will see additional bankruptcies and store closures potentially are impacting our portfolio in 2017. As we always have, we will continue to closely monitor at risk retailers and get out in front of potential vacancies. We have also done a good job of mitigating this risk on the front end by identifying struggling retailers early and reducing exposure in new deals and through divestiture. We're also very proactive and trying to get these spaces back in advance of the bankruptcy filing or store closure announcement. In [Edvane] [ph] there are few tenants that have garnered recent headlines that they are mentioning. hhgregg is 10 wholly-owned DDR centers and six joint venture centers, paying Pro Rata ADR about $3.8 million or 55 basis points, two of the 16 assets are currently on the market for sale in 2017, that will reduce our exposure to 45 basis points and lower hhgregg to number 47 from number 41 on our top 50 tenant list. In place rents average $11 which is far below our new junior box rents are today and offers significant positive spread opportunity. Many of hhgregg stores in the DDR portfolio report sales that are in line or exceed company average which would arguably reduce store closure risk in the event of reorganization. As resources also been mentioned in the media, DDR has 41 pay less locations, there are 125,000 fee total, pro rate ADR from pay less approximately $2.2 million or 30 basis points which we will put it at about number 60 on our top tenant list. These are generally small spaces around 3,000 feet and we are optimistic that we will be able to fill these as we always do in the ordinary course. Gander Mountain is another one that has been in the news with which we have five stores and 20 basis points of ADR. Our exposure here is minimal as we have the three wholly-owned locations all of which are either under contract or slated for sale this year. It would leave us with $100,000 or less of run exposure. We are very comfortable with our manageable exposure to these retailers should they close or file bankruptcy and are optimistic that will back to any surrendered stores with stronger retailers at better rents. Before I finish, I would like to address the flood of recently announced department store closures and the shadow supply that will be soon on the market. We are always laser focused on potential risks to our assets, in what remain to be seen whether retailers - are retailers are real estate agnostic as some spouse, I do not know this. Great retailers want to be next to other great retailers in easily accessible centers with convenient parking that generate high traffic counts in the prototypical box at rents that are proportionate to sales. On all counts, DDR portfolio is an industry leader and we remain highly confident in the long-term sustainability and growth of our business model. That concludes my comments, I will now turn the call over to Christa.
Christa Vesy: Thank you, Vince. For the fourth quarter, operating FFO was $111.1 million or $0.30 per share. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $111.2 million also $0.30 per share. For the full year, operating FFO was $468.4 million or $1.28 per share which is a 4.1% increase over the prior year. Including non-operating items, FFO for the quarter was $466.2 million or $1.27 per share. During the fourth quarter we closed on the sale of 24 operating assets and three land parcels for $497 million at our share bringing the full year total to 50 operating assets and nine land parcels for $833 million at our share in line with the revised 2016 disposition guidance of $700 million to $900 million. These transactions carried a weighted average cap rate of approximately 7.5%, so far in 2017 we closed on the sale of three assets for $31 million and are under contract saw an additional $168 million. Additionally in 2016, we closed on the previously disclosed acquisition of two power centers located in Phoenix, Arizona and Portland, Oregon for $148 million and subsequent to year end we also closed on the acquisition of 3030 North Broadway, a 132,000 square foot urban shopping center anchored by Mariano's grocery store located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago for $81million. The Chicago acquisition in the first quarter was originally scheduled to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 and would have represented an acquisition total for the year of approximately $230 million which is in line with our guidance of $200 million to $300 million. Additionally this acquisition represents the company's desire to not simply acquire large format power centers but to own and acquire the high quality real estate that represents an opportunity for growth and net asset value creation. This acquisition has the primary driver of the $100 million of acquisition activity disclosed in our 2017 guidance release. Before I discuss our 2017 earnings guidance further, I would like to provide some context surrounding the ranges provided in last night's press release. Given the uncertainties surrounding the potential transactions we are contemplating including the significant volume of wholly owned disposition, our commingled managing joint venture, the two Blackstone joint ventures and the associated preferred equity as well as the potential reduction of our exposure in Puerto Rico, we do expected our range could change during the year. We will be a thoughtful and communicative as possible and our commentary to the investment and analyst community to provide much information as possible as we throughout the year. While we understand guidance changes are cumbersome we are making critical decisions in 2017 to set the company up for a clean slate of earnings growth in future years. Regarding our 2017 operating FFO guidance, last night we released an operating FFO range of a $1.12 to a $1.16 per share. The reduction in projected earnings relative to 2016 primarily is driven by our strategic decision of a new management team to de-lever further with a target of six times debt-to-EBITDA while we do not take the earnings dilution expected in 2017 lightly we have made the decision to prioritize our balance sheet over earnings growth in an effort to soon position DDR to benefit from a largely strong cost of capital from a relatively strong cost of capital in an effort to generate outside future growth. Given our view that DDR's share price remains below net asset value, our primary source of capital will be asset sales between $800 million to $1 billion exclusive of DDR pro rate share joint ventures, and the associated repayment of any preferred equity. We expected cap rate on these dispositions to be in the mid to high 7% range and occur largely through the final three quarters of the year. In addition, our current guidance range does not specifically contemplate a potential opportunistic sales of any portion of our Puerto Rico portfolio. Proceeds from all asset sales and investments will be used exclusively for debt paydown which currently contemplates approximately $600 million of near term unsecured notes at a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and $360 million of wholly owned mortgage debt at a weighted average GAAP interest rate of 3.8%. I would like to point out that the 3.8% GAAP rate does carry a cash interest rate of 100 basis points higher resulting in artificial earnings benefit today with headwind upon paydown of refinancing. In 2017, we expect to pay off over $950 million of near term debt maturities at a GAAP rate of approximately 5.4% with prepayment penalties of less than $10 million. The prepayment penalties will make up the difference between the operating and NAREIT FFO ranges provided. Regarding the joint venture related line items, we expect between $30 million to $33 million of fee income down slightly from 2016 as a result of a $2.6 million one-time fee in the second quarter of 2016 as well as the potential decrease in fees as a result of the Blackstone joint venture. The timing of the exit of that venture remains uncertain and such our interest income guidance contemplates the preferred equity remaining outstanding for the majority of the year. As Tom mentioned we also expect to remain at 20% partner in our 55 asset managing joint venture. Additionally we expect 2017 G&A to be flat to slightly higher than 2016 at $77 million to $80 million and our dividends remain flat in 2017 as our payout ratios impacted by reduced operating FFO. On the operational side, same store NOI will be pressured in 2017 as the recent bankruptcies of the Sports Authority and Golfsmith as well as deteriorating fundamentals in Puerto Rico will away on performance. The full impact of these major tenant bankruptcies are reflected in our same store NOI for 2017. For contact we guided in our release to a range 1% to2% same store NOI growth in 2017 which was driven by approximately 100 basis points in the full year 2017 in back of these bankruptcies and another 50 basis points from Puerto Rico which is expected to produce negative 3.5% to 4% NOI growth in 2017. While the same store headwinds are challenged during our transition year in 2017, we are encouraged by the domestic portfolio run rate which when excluding the impact of Puerto Rico and bankruptcies would have been approximately 3%. As the final line item on 2017 guidance we expect to deliver approximately $80 million of redevelopment, largely back half rated at cost on cost yields in the high single digits as you know we bifurcate out major project like our expansions at Belgate and Charlotte and leaves the general land out as incremental NOI to our same store growth. As a result approximately half of the $80 million that will be placed and serviced during the year is considered major and therefore incremental to that same store NOI figure. Finally I would like to discuss the expected impact of our 2017 capital allocation decisions on future earnings given the significant amount of transactional and joint venture activity projected for this year, there is a risk the timing of that activity leaves further in the year and therefore may lead to further dilution the following year. While 2017 represents a final year of our major disposition in joint venture wind down activity it nonetheless as a multiyear fact and could lead to a multiyear negative impact on earnings growth. Our strategic goals to position this company with the best in class balance sheet portfolio an earnings growth trajectory, while we have full conviction in a long term decisions outlined on this call we are more staggered of the future DDR and the growth and stability that those decisions will detail. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning guys. Christa you mentioned the multiyear negative impact on earnings growth just looking at the 800 to 1 billion of asset sales in 2017 you expect, you are not transacting amenity how much is then there for the Blackstone JV or for Puerto Rico and can you give us sense for what else in that bucket. I'm assuming it doesn’t encompass sort of - all of the Blackstone JV or may be it has and you still like the stuff Puerto Rico looking beyond how much more dilutive capacity so, its $0.30 kind of the Q4 '16 quarterly number what’s the steady stake quarterly FFO after you do everything that you do want to $0.25, $0.26 I think for the market tricks that the all the things that you are doing and the potential dilution associated with that, those changes, having a sense of what the floor and FFO could be.
Christa Vesy: Sure, so just a back up a bit. From a Blackstone perspective we really aren’t projecting much of an impact on the 2017 earnings, anything that would happen with something that could be kind of more of end of years so that's also from a fee standpoint. When you look year-over-year just kind of bridging from 2016 to 2017 and looking at that may be $0.12 to $0.14 decrease in operating FFO we're looking at about may be $0.09 of that is a combination of probably 2016 the full year impact of the 2016 asset sales, as well as projecting for 2017. Also looking at the bucket of the asset sales and you’re talking about the $800 million to $1 billion as Tom mentioned and as I mentioned in my comment, that’s not really something that specific to Puerto Rico. That’s just looking at an overall general bucket. So that’s something as we progress during the year and we made progress on our asset sales we’ll probably have a little bit more color as to what to that – how that run rate could get impacted.
Operator: And the next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning every one. Could we talk a little bit about perhaps evolving dialogue you’re having with the buyers that are looking at the Puerto Rico assets, how has the buyer pool changed, what is the if there is any kind of re-pricing activity that’s happening. And I guess a second part to that question and maybe important is, if you get [indiscernible] including Puerto Rico done, what is the remaining pro forma quality of DDR portfolio look like and if you can maybe apply some operating assistance say for demographic data around it so that maybe the market can better appreciate even though you have less earnings per share what that quality looks like?
Thomas August: Let me address the Puerto Rico first. First of all I guess the best way to characterize it is clearly is the private companies, no public REITs are interested right now. I think that there is a recognition that Puerto Rico might be a great investment at this point in time but you know some of you guys want to get on this quarter to quarter and have to explain it for the next two or three years while it turns. So all of the buyer – not all by buyers, the buyers we’re talking are all private buyers, they are all fund type raising money in the LC Puerto Rico is even with today's rate interest rate they see as a good cash flow projection that they can make some cash flow on and hopefully benefit on the upside when this things turns around it stabilizes. So that’s kind of where Puerto Rico is. And I can't remember…
Matthew Lougee: So Ki Bin it’s Matt. On the pro forma portfolio obviously this would exclude Puerto Rico being a part of the conversation. As we outlined 800 million to 1 billion of asset sales likely domestic, we’re probably looking at an asset count in the low 200 range. Certainly fewer JVs as Blackstone goes away. Very hard to peg demographics on that, we have it internally but obviously it’s a mixed bag of assets sales. We don’t know what’s going to head so it’s hard to peg that. Rents first quarter what I think you see today roughly 15.50 that should be north of 16. Once we get down with asset sales I think you’re looking at a larger overall asset size and notably you’re looking at a growth rate if we’re selling 0% to 1% potentially negative growth rate assets in the 2% to closer 3% range.
Operator: The next question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks just wanted to follow up a little bit on Puerto Rico and sort of transacting there. So you have some interested parties, you have some indications for debt financing so it come down to pricing and I was just wondering if you can characterize where pricing is on some level and then what would be a reasonable time frame to get something done from this point forward if something were to get done here at this point in the cycle.
Thomas August: What I can tell you - I am not going to tell you what I think reasonable pricing is. I think we’re going to wait and see and then we'll make a decision when we get that in. In terms of timing I would hope we will have some indication within the next 30 to 60 days and then it would probably be another 60 to 90 after that to close something assuming we had acceptable offers. I think look at where the market is changing pretty dramatically even from the last six month to now, so I think we want to be flexible but prudent and reasonable on what we can live with in terms of pricing on any assets here in Puerto Rico.
Operator: The next question is from Jeremy Metz of UBS.
Jeremy Metz: Hi guys. You talked about some of the increasing interest from the mall based tenants so I just wondering if you can give us some more color on exactly what you are seeing on this front and then with the Golfsmith and Sports Authority leases you mentioned Gander Mountain probably you’re going to get some spaces back from office supply names. So I am just wondering how deep really is the tenant pool and demand today for these bigger boxes and how many of these are more going to be candidates to spend the smaller boxes where maybe demand is a little stronger. Thanks.
Vincent Corno: This is Vince. I would tell you right now we see pretty robust demand as we’ve improved the overall quality of our portfolio. Now the boxes that we are getting back we really not having lacking for demand for the most part. I would tell you that with respect to the small shop tenants, we’ve seen a rise in overtures from - retailers that historically been mall based tenants expressing interest in exploring possibilities of coming in to our centers. I think in recognition of the fact that certain malls in this country may be subject to risks given the department store status, but all said, we're finding tenants and the demand we see is robust for the vast majority of the boxes that we're getting back and we feel very good that we can redeploy these boxes with better quality retailers that would be accretive to the merchandise mix of the center at better rents in most cases.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Hi, everyone. I know we spent a lot of time at Puerto Rico here but just curious you mentioned getting five to six quotes and being happy about that on pricing for the financial side of things. I am just curious when those quotes were provided and whether or not they contemplated some deterioration here we are seeing in the fourth quarter, as well as expected in 2017?
Vincent Corno: I can’t answer what they were contemplating I can tell you that the quotes came in mid-to-late January - certainly mid-to-late January. So they are pretty up-to-date.
Vincent Chao: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies.
George Hoglund: Yes. One more on Puerto Rico. You noted the 60% potential LTV, how much additional financing you think a potential buyer would be looking for in terms of what they be also looking for [indiscernible] any preferred equity and would DDR be willing or think it might be necessary to provide any seller financing?
Thomas August: I think that some form of secondary financing would probably be required and I think depending upon the pricing and where it fits in the capitals deck we will be flexible and certainly considered it may be deal happen.
Operator: And the next question comes from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill: Hi, good morning guys. Promise I am not going to ask about Puerto Rico. I was curious about some of the comments you made about Class B assets and specifically some of the demand that you were seeing for value ad plays whereas the market activity was more limited for stabilized B properties and B markets. So I was hoping maybe you give a little bit more color on the 50 to 100 basis points cap rate widening that you're seeing in B assets, separated between value ad plays and stabilized B properties is it uniformly 50 to 100 basis points or it's attracting the value ad plays is maybe those are widened now little bit more?
Matthew Lougee: Hi, Rich its Mat. So based on Tom's commentary, I would say we haven’t seen any irrational widening of that, you’d argue that 18 months ago it could've been a rational in terms of stabilize B quality centers or A assets and B markets for those that are taking subset in the power center space. We’ve seen that widening roughly 100 basis points we’ve seen that in the high 70 today, I don't think that’s property all for DDR most of the re-portfolio as most of the bulk of our assets were A quality assets and A quality market. But As and Bs and B quality market is what we are selling today. That certainly gone out value ad certainly gets double the triple the number of bidders, if you’re selling 100% leased center that’s a good solid bound in a B market today, you're going to have one-third of the bidders that you already have a vacant box. And whether or not those potential buyers can do better than DDR could potentially do, remains to be determined, but certainly more bidders, better pricing and probably with the value add component who knows on the cap rate at this point as we market this stuff but you're probably two to three times the number of bidders to those assets.
Operator: And the next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning. First Tom nice to see some new blood on the Board and look forward to that continuing. Just a question on Manatee on the Inland JV and you guys before had spoken about simplifying DDR exiting the Blackstone obviously got Puerto Rico on the market and then also exiting the Inland as a way to clean up the portfolio get away from the JVs and just have really wholly-owned assets. So just curious why you guys are deciding to stay in the Inland JV?
Thomas August: Alex there are several reasons. Number one is we found a partner to extend it. So it’s a little bit longer term rather than shorter-term deals that where we are in. I think secondly and again most importantly is, we are undergoing a significant downsizing. Now as we are selling assets, we would like to think at some point we are going to be growing. So to us this was a nice bridge from Point A to Point B we keep the fees in place, we keep the roofers in place on assets that we really like both grocery and power centers and we are thinking that in a not too distant future, we will be able to exercise that role for a number of assets and convert them from 20% own to 100% own. So A it bridges us a little bit certainly with fees and secondly it provides us an opportunity I think a leg up obviously with the roofer to buy assets that we really like to buy when our debt levels are a little bit more acceptable.
Operator: And the next question will come from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, so I won’t promise that I won’t ask you any more questions on Puerto Rico, but I guess my question is Tom you mentioned there is more demand from selected pieces of the portfolio in Puerto Rico, which I assume means the better quality assets La Plaza del Sol. So I am curious really how vital are likely partial sale here really is. How would you explain that to the marketplace especially they would leave with lower quality, less desirable assets in Puerto Rico and I guess as a different question, can you give us a broad sense of what the cap rate differential for the upper and lower quality asset in your Puerto Rico portfolio compared to the U.S., your couple U.S. assets? Thanks.
Thomas August: Well I can't answer all of that. But I can tell you this - I think we are recognizing that if we sell part of the portfolio we want to be left with something that saleable as well. If we have 12 assets, we are not selling the top four and you'll stick with the bottom eight. We are going to sell enough so that we are comfortable with what we have left. And you know to be honest there has been so few asset sales in Puerto Rico right now. I don’t think we are in a position to tell you what the cap rate is, we are kind of anxious to find that up for ourselves from our buyers. But I can - you can rest assured that we are keenly aware that people would like to buy the best assets of the best two assets and we recognize that if we don’t sell the whole thing we have to be left with something that is saleable once things stabilize a little bit further.
Vincent Corno: Tom if I could add something to that. I think for the most part across the portfolio the 14 assets that we have on the island they range from power to script to malls, all of those formats we’re comfortable with. So if we mix and match and there is a partial sale, we have the expertise to be able to run very efficiently with the balance.
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: Hi. I guess going back to the JVs for a second. I guess the comment was in 2017 you are wrapping up the major JV repositioning, so it looks like you found the new home for Manatee on Blackstone, it doesn't sound like we should bank on something happening in 2017. Is there anything else that we should be aware of it's on the horizon in terms of the JV unwinding? And I guess by the end of 2018 do you think you could be in a position where Blackstone JV is gone, Puerto Rico is gone is that kind of – what you are aiming for?
Thomas August: Well first of all, we really not in position and have no indications from Blackstone for the timing of the ballroom sale. So I tell in before everybody, but I can’t give you a better answer we sort of model a very little half of this year from an earnings perspective. In Puerto Rico we are anxious to do something but we are anxious to do something on a prudent basis. So we hopefully we will find out what that translates into next 60 to 90 days as these potential buyers come up with offers and then we’ll just to have to give you more update on the next conference call. But I don’t want to project anything right now, because we just don’t know.
Operator: And the next question comes from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons.
Carol Kemple: Good morning. It looks like in the fourth quarter there was about 100 basis points spread between the lease income and commence rate, do you expect that to be similar at the end of 2017 or do you expect that to close and if so where do you expect that spread to be?
Vincent Corno: I am sorry, that was the 100 basis point spread between leasing and commence was that you said?
Carol Kemple: Yes. 140 basis points between leasing and commence?
Vincent Corno: What I would tell you is that we have a number of - this level is pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past, I mean the 40 basis points. We have a number of larger deals that are in the pipeline that’s kind of unique just to this particular quarter. We have a first time for instance at [indiscernible] 30,000 feet. So I would say to you that this is just ordinary course differential. There is nothing in there that is unusual.
Carol Kemple: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question comes from Michael Gorman of BTIG.
Michael Gorman: Thanks, good morning. Could you just spend a little time talking about the G&A run rate and kind of how you think about the platform going forward? You are about a net seller of 700 million last year, another about 1 billion this year, you talk about simplifying the platform. So can you kind of put that into context with 3% increase in G&A at the midpoint and where you think that goes from there?
Christa Vesy: Yes, I mean on a full year basis, I think when we look out at the 3% increase I think we think that’s pretty reasonable. I think we feel comfortable where we sit today with the portfolio that our level is in line. I think it’s not unreasonable particularly compared to where we see our peers. Obviously it’s a number that we’re mindful of and we pay close attention to. But I think when we look out again how we’ve trended as a percentage of revenue over the years on the portfolio side I think we see that number, there is room for improvement but I think it looks pretty in line for this next year.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Michael Bilerman: Good morning it’s Michael Bilerman with Christie. Tom I had just two questions. One in your opening comments you talked about having some announcements by the end of the quarter if not sooner on the completion of the management team and so I am just curious maybe you can expand a little bit on that but also talk about the G&A impact whether that’s in the 77 million to 80 million or not in terms of the types of hires that you are looking to make. And then the second question relates to sort of FFO and the trajectory and I think you and Christa had both talked about there is a lot of things that are out there in the guidance are going change over the year. I think one thing that would be helpful for the street is start to focusing on where you are going to be when all set and done and perhaps thinking about where you are going to be in the fourth quarter after you’ve at least completed what you’ve laid out in the guidance of you know almost $1 billion of sales and the same-store. What is that quarterly FFO in the fourth quarter? And then we can start modeling in Puerto Rico, we can start modeling in Blackstone and then I think the street can start focusing on what that bottom level is of FFO so they can get comfortable in buying the stock. And I think having that disclosure and having those numbers would be very helpful.
Thomas August: Unfortunately Michael I cannot give you too much more color. Obviously as I said, we’re well underway in the process of finalizing the management organizational positions. I think we’re in good shape. If we find a real good guy who wants a lot of money we’ll pay him slight effect to G&A but right now I think we’re good shape on that.
Matthew Lougee: Michael, it's Matt. On FFO growth as we think about modeling in conjunction with how you guys think about it it’s not lost on us that our trajectory is down significantly this year. We are contemplating internally what the run rate on that it. I think based on the same store, the long term same stores guidance of this portfolio which we’ve not given yet and we will articulate to the market of hopefully something closer to 3%. In addition of our redevelopment pipeline and transactional activity I think a range of 4% to 6% FFO growth is something that we’re targeting internally and so I think we’ll be out with those assumptions soon. One thing we do want to note to the market is that in 2018 as a result of significant transactional activity in 2007 it will pressure, will likely pressure earnings in 2018 and we hope that that’s modeled in and we’ll work with the street on that. But after the impact of those asset sales we do expect to be a 4% to 6% FFO growth company, healthy dividend growth on top of that to get to a high single-digit total shareholder return after that.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One.
Chris Lucas: Hi, good morning everyone. I guess Tom just trying to get a little clarity on the disposition pool given the fact that you sort of removed the JVs from that as a potential source or not a likely source of proceeds and Puerto Rico also sort of not being included. So I guess what I'm wondering is that what risk is there that out of the $800 billion or 1 billion of asset sales that you're targeting for dispositions this year, how much of that is actually going to remain a prime or prime plus type category or muscle essentially being sold in order to meet the leverage guidance.
Thomas August: No, what we've done, we’ve sort of prioritized the sales in terms of as metric site outlined at the beginning, whether we slow growth markets we don’t want, fully leased. And so far so good, I do suspect that as the year progresses there will be have to be some trade-offs we’re going to make because not everything is going to hit, we’re going to find some markets as Matt alluded to before where maybe it’s a stabilized B market or B asset and people just, the cap rate is too light for us to swallow. So as of yet we haven’t had to make those trade-offs so I would think that maybe just is a wild guess, you know, 200 million to 300 million maybe we have to go to prime assets if everything – if something fall out of bid. But so far we’ve got a list of assets that I think we’re comfortable with and so far the market is absorbing them. If it changes we clearly going to have to make some decisions but I don’t think it’s going to substantial.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from George Hoglund of Jefferies.
George Hoglund: Just looking at total potential asset sales in 2017, hypothetically if you guys got a bid, an acceptable bid for the whole Puerto Rico portfolio tomorrow would that impact how you review the remaining asset sales or could we end up in a scenario where we see 1.5 billion to 2 billion of asset sales in 2017?
Thomas August: Well, let's gets that offering will be, that will a great position for us to be in but clearly would affect it. I mean, especially as we reflect in the previous question that was asked, if we have to start trading-off between prime assets and selling things. If we can get Puerto Rico sold I'm sure it will make us and the Board rethink how much we should be selling to get our leverage done and maybe we’ll go a little bit lower than 6 and maybe we’ll just decided if that’s enough and clearly there will be some trade-offs we make if we get an offer for Puerto Rico that’s acceptable shortly.
Operator: The next is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here. Is Puerto Rico I guess doesn’t happen to the degree you're expecting, does that effectively make you want to slow down other asset sales because Puerto Rico would take up more of your NOI - the slides of NOI pie. And the second question you mentioned cap rates in the A markets for A assets. Just broadly speaking what percent of your portfolio of NOI is in that group?
Thomas August: I think that we have a goal of getting to the 60 times. We haven’t budgeted Puerto Rico being sold in there so I don’t think as I sit here today that that would affect our thinking very much and I think we want to – we get down we’ll have to deal with Puerto Rico some other way. So I think that answers the first question Matt, I want you to take the second part.
Matthew Lougee: Ki Bin it’s Matt. And we’ll provide you guys with a much better breakdown of portfolio post asset sales. At this point today A assets in A market is classified by call the top 30 MSAs were very, very strong growth assets in the top 50 MSAs. I think I guess probably three-quarters of the portfolio that’s in there. The remaining 25% you are going to have Puerto Rico and then you are going to have A assets and B markets and that’s some of the stuff on the market today, very, very little non-prime and prime minus stuff. So probably three-quarters of that is As in A markets.
Operator: And our next question is from Floris van Dijkum of Boenning.
Floris van Dijkum: Thank you. A quick question for you guys. In terms of property type it sounds like maybe you are more open to broadening your - the type of ownership obvious the acquisition in Chicago was more of a lifestyle urban lifestyle center and the Manatee has a lot of grocery anchored. Are you - you think that the composition of your portfolio in two or three years’ time could have a lesser way to power centers?
Thomas August: I think it may change. I think what we’re looking at in terms of I don’t think - this is not a total strategy shift but I think 70% of our portfolio today has some sort of grocery component to it and I think that what we’ve seen is the quality and how we’re able to handle grocery especially in markets where we have a big presence we’re very comfortable with. So I think we’re going to be focused clearly going to be a power company but focusing on good real estate and good markets and especially if we have a presence here I think we’re more likely to stick with grocery than otherwise.
Operator: And next we have a follow-up from Christy McElroy.
Christy McElroy.: Just a question on the disposition 800 million to 1 billion what is the range of cap rates on the aggregate dispositions as embedded in guidance. And secondarily, I assume those are excluded from the 1% to 2% same-store growth but what would that collection of assets have done in terms of same-store performance or what was the total portfolio has been if those assets were included.
Vincent Corn: I think overall we’re in the 7.5ish rage for everything we’re projecting to sell and I am not sure I understand. Matt did you understand this.
Matthew Lougee: Yes, we’re in the 7.5ish range for what we’re selling Michael. One thing we caveat on that based on your follow-up question on growth is that we view the NOI the lot of these assets at risk and so the year one cap rate is not really indicative of a cash flow growth profile of these assets which is why they are on the market. And so the NOI growth is certainly below what we’re projecting for the long-term growth of this company at 2% to 3% hopefully on the higher end of that range. So the ones we’re selling are you can assume are credibly in the flattish to potentially negative growth rate range.
Operator: And this concludes our question and answer session. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

This release and our quarterly financial supplements are available on our website at www.ddr.com. For those of you on the phone who would like to follow along viewing today's presentation, please visit the Events section of our Investor Relations page and sign in to the earnings call webcast. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good evening and thank you for adapting your schedules so that we could communicate with you about our results and initial business planning as quickly as possible. First, I'd like to say how honored I am to have been asked to lead this excellent organization and express my thanks to the Board of Directors for extending this wonderful opportunity. DDR has faced some challenges over the years, but that doesn't take away from the extraordinary people working here who have invested so much of themselves into this business. I'm incredibly grateful to be working with such diligent, intelligent and capable colleagues. We're going to depart from established practice this quarter and touch on a broader range of topics during this call in an attempt to begin answering questions I know you all have. We'll discuss our quarterly results first, including a description of our new earnings guidance and then move on to the restructuring we announced at the beginning of the month. Finally and most importantly, we'll discuss the short- and long term business plan we have begun to implement. Before I move on to earnings, I'd like to address our rationale for moving to DDR. Mike, Matt and I made this move with the expressed intention of making tough decisions as quickly as possible. We're aware the volatility has been painful for investors and I want you to know that we share your sense of urgency and the need for change. We believe change is most critical in capital allocation and balance sheet management. Regardless of our stock’s multiple, we intend to treat our capital as scarce and costly and risk adjustment will be central to every allocation decision. The balance sheet is key to risk management and it's our intention not just to lower leverage which can be costly to shareholders, but also to manage our liquidity and maturity schedule which are less painful but equally important to address. We're here mainly because we believe DDR can exploit what is quickly becoming the most dynamic retail environment in decades. The challenges we face are at once undeniable and sobering, dramatic change in demand for retail space and formats, a spate of tenant bankruptcies, many in our core tenant base and, of course, widespread investor fear that retail real estate will simply become obsolete. You can see these challenges in our share price, in our earnings this quarter and certainly, in many of the assets you drive by on your daily commute. But changing fundamentals and subsequent investor concern can also spell opportunity. Opportunity that we believe DDR can exploit because of the breadth and the depth of this platform. We have dozens of leasing professionals working in multiple offices spanning the U.S. We own assets in scores of important local markets and we operate across the retail property spectrum type, from grocery-anchored centers to outlets, lifestyle centers and of course, a big collection of semi-regional value-oriented assets. These assets plus our skilled staff mean we have daily touch points and relationships with the nation's largest, most important retailers. Putting our plans to work and combining them with our collective experience, we see several key advantages. Number one, we're capital oriented. We're currently prioritizing balance sheet repositioning over investing, so that we can ultimately buy assets in a potentially thin investor pool. Number two, we're cash flow focused. Our main goal is to generate actual returns on retail real estate over a reasonable time period. Gone are the days where one can buy an asset simply because it produces a higher average ABR, better overall demographics or short term noncash FFO accretion. Third, we're collaborative. Challenges like those being presented to us today demand an ability and a willingness to work with a wide range of constituents, including capital partners, municipalities, retailers and even simply departments within our own organization. Fourth, we're creative. We look at what makes a property successful and will continue to think outside the box when looking to deploy capital. We're passionate about seeing how an asset can become something different. Fifth, we're contrarian. We like looking outside expensive gateway markets to find highly profitable assets with attractive initial returns. Hopefully, this serves as a useful introduction to our approach to this business and how we intend to turn risk into opportunity. I'll add more substance later, but I'd like first to address the company's results for the quarter which were ahead of our internal budget even if they were adversely affected by the ongoing impact of The Sports Authority and other bankruptcies. Our quarterly Operating FFO result of $0.30 a share was ahead of our forecast, driven largely by better-than-expected results from Puerto Rico, an acceleration of lease amortization from the termination of a Sears ground lease in Coon Rapids, Minnesota and lower-than-expected G&A cost after adjusting for onetime charges, offset by lower interest income resulting from the reserve we're taking on the Blackstone joint venture preferred investments. We have some headwinds ahead of us which Mike will address more directly, but I feel extremely positive about the leasing team and the progress we're making. I'll hand the call over to Mike and then Matt to briefly cover some of the quarter's key results and I'll return post to continue discussing our initial business planning. Mike?
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. DDR's results this quarter and for the remainder of the year are being weighed down by significant anchor vacancies resulting from recent tenant bankruptcies from The Sports Authority, hhgregg and Golfsmith. Same-store NOI for the quarter was down 10 basis points, including a 3.3% decline in Puerto Rico. Excluding results from Puerto Rico, same-store NOI was up 50 basis points. Our portfolio of lease rates fell to 94.3% from 95% last quarter. While these bottom line results are relatively modest when compared to the last several years, they should not take away from the outstanding job being done by our leasing team in retailing spaces. In fact, we executed 285 leases and renewals totaling 1.8 million square feet in the first quarter, nearly 200,000 square feet of which was formerly vacant. Finally, blended leasing spreads this quarter were 5.6%. The leasing spread result was negatively affected this quarter by a single-anchor deal in Puerto Rico. The lease was the first step in the reactivation of a dark but rent-paying anchor and we're excited about the prospects for backfilling the remaining space at a significant positive spread. Without this lease in Puerto Rico, new leasing spreads were 16%. Given the impact of tenant bankruptcies on results, I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing our prospects for re-leasing these large vacant spaces. Let's start with The Sports Authority whose former space we've had control over for the longest period. We expect to make significant progress on these in 2017. We already have about 40% of the spaces re-leased and we expect to have rent commencements for 77,000 feet of additional space by the end of this year, with the vast majority reoccupied and generating revenues by mid-2018. On hhgregg, another significant retail bankruptcy, 2 spaces or 17% of the GLA is already either re-leased or assumed and we expect re-leasing and corresponding rent generation to take about 18 months for the balance of the spaces. Finally, on Golfsmith, the last of the large recent tenant bankruptcy impacts, 50% of the leases have either been assumed or replaced and we expect to re-lease the remainder over a similar 18-month period. Bankruptcies are, of course, undesirable and they're clearly attracting a lot of press, but spaces in strong locations with good traffic tend to get re-leased. From that perspective, I'd like to highlight some of the significant open to buys out there as well as deals we've done over the last couple of years with these retailers. While the news has emphasized the challenges faced in the retail industry, a wide range of tenants continue to expand. In the review of the 30 most active tenants with whom we're working on deals, the open to buy is nearly 3,000 units. And given the breadth of our portfolio and the talent of our leasing team, we're confident DDR will continue to be well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity. The Internet and changing consumer patterns will undoubtedly cause some weak retailers to fall into distress, but there is still a healthy list of high-quality replacement anchors, including the TJX brands, Ulta Beauty, Dick's, Aldi, Ross, Five Below and Burlington. I'll now hand the call over to Matt to discuss key transaction and accounting topics for the quarter.
Matthew Ostrower: Thank you, Mike. I'll start with a review of key transactions in the quarter, starting with incremental ongoing deleveraging through asset sales of $124 million. We have an additional $49 million of dispositions and loan payoffs completed quarter-to-date. Moving from transactions to impairment, we established a combined $76 million valuation allowance for 2 preferred investments with current aggregate face amounts of $395 million that the company made when the 2 Blackstone joint ventures were established in 2014 and 2015. These reserves are noncash in nature and we expect no change in cash interest income from the JVs until they are liquidated. That said, in conjunction with the $76 million charge to GAAP net income incurred in association with the establishment of the reserves, we have stopped recognizing the noncash portion of the preferred dividends that we continue to be owed on the entire face amount of the preferred security. This will cause GAAP preferred dividends which we include in interest income on the income statement, to decline $8 million annually starting in the second quarter. The principles for assessing the impairment for this type of investment are similar to a loan and thus, unlike for a typical consolidated real estate investment, depend on how a third-party looks at current market values. As a result, the valuation of our Blackstone preferreds are much more exposed to recent increases in cap rates for certain big-box assets in secondary and tertiary markets. Our preferred investments in these partnerships receive preferred distributions from operating cash flows. However, capital distributions are treated differently. When proceeds from asset sales are distributed prior to 2020 and 2021, they are subject to sharing with the common partners. After 2020 and 2021, when DDR can exercise its preferred redemption rights, capital distributions are made first to the preferred securities. Blackstone which exercises significant control over these joint ventures, continues to pursue sales of these assets. So we believe there is a very high likelihood of fund liquidation ahead of the 2020 and 2021. Our allowance reflects our expectation that in the event today's higher cap rates persist and Blackstone liquidates the JVs before 2020 and 2021, there will be insufficient proceeds to repay the full face value of our preferred investments. We have provided a more fulsome description of the cash flow and capital proceed structures of these preferred investments in our supplemental. I'd like to now turn to a discussion of our revised 2017 guidance. First, given the uncertainty inherent in transactions and given the significant weight of transactions in prior guidance, we're withdrawing annual EPS, FFO and Operating FFO per share guidance. That said, we will continue to provide as much transparency as we can about our expectations of other metrics over which we have more control. First, on same-store NOI, we have revised our expectations to negative 1.5% to 0%. This change reflects the current management's most up-to-date view of 2017 leasing and operations, especially the impact of vacancies from the tenant bankruptcies Mike outlined in his presentation. 3 factors account for over 200 basis points of these expected 2017 growth headwinds, one, our 3 largest bankruptcies; two, Puerto Rico; and three, 2 other one-off anchor move-outs. The bottom end of the guidance range assumes additional tenant bankruptcies and anchor move-outs which we feel is appropriate given the dynamic nature of retail fundamentals today. For modeling purposes, our 1Q run rate does not include any income from The Sports Authority or Golfsmith but does include a full quarter of income from hhgregg stores which closed in April. Our expected lease rate is now 93% to 93.5% to reflect these changes. We would expect pro rata same-store NOI, including Puerto Rico, to trough in the second quarter with Puerto Rico's own results expected to trough in the third quarter. Second, on G&A, the organizational changes we announced earlier this month are generating a reduction in the top and bottom end of our G&A guidance to reflect the approximate $6 million of annual run rate savings we indicated the changes would generate. We don't have control over tenant bankruptcies, but we're doing everything in our power on the expense side to mute the impact of bankruptcies on the company's overall profitability. Our guidance for interest income has fallen $7 million to reflect the prepayment of a higher-yielding mortgage loan the company purchased at a discount to par in 2010, as well as the impact of the valuation allowance I just described on the Blackstone preferreds. As David will outline in greater detail, we fully intend to make some significant changes to the balance sheet this year, whether from dispositions or refinancings and some of these may prove to be accretive to FFO. But the magnitude and timing of these changes are too difficult to predict at this time. We will provide updates as we execute on our repositioning. We want to be clear that we're extremely focused on improving corporate liquidity, lowering leverage and increasing duration. We're also committed to our unsecured structure and our investment-grade credit rating. I'd now like to turn the call over to David, who will discuss initial thoughts on our strategic plan.
David Lukes: Thanks, Matt. One key change we effectuated since quarter end is the organizational streamlining we announced at the beginning of the month. These were, without question, extremely difficult decisions to make, but we're convinced they are right for the company and for our shareholders. DDR's portfolio has shrunk significantly over the past several years without a commensurate decline in our employment base. Our goal in the restructuring was to be decisive, timely as well as thoughtful and objective. While we reduced headcount significantly, no particular area of the company was targeted nor do we lose the ability to respond to changing business conditions or exploit new opportunities. While the changes were difficult, we can now provide clarity to our team that we've got the right people moving forward. I'd like to turn now to the future. I'll break my comments into both shorter term principles and observations as well as thoughts on where our long term business plan is going. On the short term side of things, I'll outline 5 key plans and principles. First, as I outlined earlier, we came to DDR to make tough decisions in a timely and thoughtful manner. I can assure you that no one wants answers or decisions as badly as we do. That said, given the impact of these decisions to our overall profitability and capital base, we must take time to understand the assets and the various alternatives in front of us. Second, we intend to lower leverage and improve liquidity. This is a reflection of our view that less debt means less risk and that investment opportunities tend to arise when capital is scarce. We're as aware as anyone about the costs associated with deleveraging and we intend to weigh those costs carefully against the benefits of capital assets. But I sit here today with confidence that we can make measurable progress on this front without accepted dilution to value. As I said in my opening remarks, we as a management team are examining a range of strategic options and that involves assessing the sustainability of our dividend payout ratio. While the dividend falls under the domain of our Board of Directors, we currently believe there's a significant cushion to the payout ratio even after taking into account our deleveraging plans. Third, we believe liquidity is even more important than measures of overall leverage and we'll be looking to improve the term structure of our liabilities, taking advantage of still relatively low long term interest rates to term out our debt where it's prudent. In short, we'll be seeking to significantly lengthen balance sheet maturities and ensure limited short term debt roll. Given that the company has some higher interest rate maturities coming up, this should partially mitigate dilution from deleveraging. Fourth, we'll seek to address and provide closure on our Puerto Rico exposure as quickly as possible. Senior management has already spent a lot of time visiting and analyzing these assets, not to mention getting our hands around the critical macro environment. We do believe we own some of the best real estate on the island, but we're not naïve to the economic challenges or the impact the significant exposure there may continue to have on our stock's valuation, particularly if we successfully shrink the size of the domestic portfolio. The asset markets are more challenged in Puerto Rico than they are in the continental U.S., making transactions extremely difficult to execute and we're not a distressed seller. We're diligently considering and assessing all options, including a full or a partial portfolio sale, joint ventures, mortgage financing, holding most or all of the assets as well as other creative alternatives for the portfolio such as a spinoff. Fifth and finally, while we always conduct communications with our shareholders and analysts in the spirit of maximum transparency, we also believe that previewing some strategic plans, especially those involving transactions, can be damaging to our negotiating position and to investor expectations and confidence. For this reason, we're establishing a clear policy that we will be communicating about transaction specifics only after they have occurred. Now on to our long term planning and analysis. Before I describe some of our strategic plans, I'd like to provide some observations arising from our initial analysis of DDR's portfolio, some of which I believe run counter to conventional wisdom. First, DDR's portfolio is diverse. It has a well-known value tilt towards big-box centers, but this value orientation is accomplished in a high-quality manner, with nearly 2/3 of our ABR coming from centers that have the strongest discounters in the country like Ross, T.J.Maxx, Marshalls and Burlington. Roughly 1/3 of our properties are anchored by traditional grocers like Publix, Kroger and Giant Eagle as well as specialty grocers like Whole Foods, Sprouts and Trader Joe's. Another 35% is anchored by mass merchants like Costco, Super Walmart and Super Target that tend to allocate a significant portion of their GLA to groceries. That is a combined lot of food exposure which brings more frequent customer shopping trips. Separately, as a measure of the quality of the land underneath many of our centers, about 30% of the properties have premium anchors such as Whole Foods, Wegmans, Nordstrom Rack, Costco and Trader Joe's. Finally, a physical inspection of many of our assets suggests we have very little shop space. Only 22% of our GLA falls into that category. Our economics, on the other hand, are quite different, with nearly 40% of our ABR derived from these smaller tenants. These in-line tenants drive healthy leasing economics for DDR. An analysis of our 2015 and 2016 leasing transactions suggests that the $100-plus million of capital the company invested over that time period generated very healthy double-digit unleveraged cash return on costs even when weighted with the cost of down time and these returns were boosted by especially compelling returns on shop leasing. While an increase in anchor vacancies may erode these returns to some degree, the analysis suggests that there's significant cushion to allow us to continue to meet our cost of capital. We have a lot of anchors, but there's sufficient in-line space, a business that remains healthy and growing, to enable us to achieve our return objectives. Good leasing economics translate into good cash flow generation at the property level. An analysis of the company's same-store NOI adjusting for CapEx spent at each property over the last 4 years suggests that this is indeed the case. Following some tough years during and immediately after the financial crisis, DDR saw the benefits of operating leverage as CapEx fell and leasing remained robust, allowing the cash generated by the same-store pool to increase significantly faster than reported same-store NOI itself. Again, recent anchor vacancy will adversely affect these economics, but it's good to see that historical investments in the portfolio have yielded real benefits. And before we get carried away by the obvious challenges facing retailers today and the potential spillover effects on our portfolio, we should remind ourselves that the credit backing, our largest tenants, remains healthy on average. To attempt to measure this, we've created an index of debt and operating metrics for most of the top 50 tenants on the schedule provided in our supplemental and weighted those metrics by our pro rata revenue exposure to each of those tenants. As you can see, despite the negative news on a number of tenants, our leases which are effectively unsecured obligations from retailers, remains high to strong credit. Said differently, the news on retailers may remain challenging for some time, but we believe they remain positioned to meet their contractual lease obligations. Now I'd like to return to strategy and share our goals for the future of our portfolio and give you some insights as to how we evaluate retail real estate and how it will affect our investment decisions in the future. Our long term goals are to create durable and sustainable returns for our shareholders with a focus on NAV growth from a stable base of well-positioned assets. We'll give you a summary of our real estate principles and provide some initial commentary on what we've found within our existing portfolio so you can see how our thought process will influence our investment and divestment decisions. Shareholder capital is precious. We need a compelling reason to deploy capital and our decision to do so will be guided by 3 primary criteria evaluated on an asset by asset basis. Leasing, development and property management leadership all have a strong voice in this process, especially given their historical knowledge. First, we want to hold a strong base of assets with durable cash flows. This means naturally growing NOI due to strong market fundamentals and solid market position from a good tenant mix and location. Second, we believe significant opportunity exists in assets where the built square footage is not achieving the most profitable result for the landlord. Many investors currently view big-box centers with skepticism. Some of this is warranted and we will sell those assets we determine to have weak fundamentals. On the other hand, many big-box centers have a shopping draw deep into a 5- or a 7-mile trade area and largely ignore the needs of the closer-in 3-mile ring. The convenience aspect of shopping for both good and services is a distinct goal of our investment decisions, so we like assets that under serve the local population and we see opportunities to create value by exploiting the arbitrage between box and small shop rents. Greater consumer traffic should mean more durable cash flows and the easiest way to accomplish that is to fill a market void, deboxing certain properties and adding small shops with services and goods geared towards convenient shopping is exactly what we're looking for. Thirdly, we'll focus our efforts on properties that have even more significant, sometimes transformational, redevelopment potential. Sometimes this is due to low density, sometimes due to below market rents and often a result of zoning upside with alternative uses. You'll see us apply our focus and expertise to capture this type of value. We're still in the process of a thorough portfolio review. However, we've already begun to apply our investment criteria as we seek to delever from asset sales. One way to create a sell list is to instead focus on a keep list. I'd like to briefly talk about some of our keepers identified to date because you can get a better sense of how our 3 investment criteria are applied. Keep in mind that we're taking a fresh look at the positioning and prospective cash flows of every one of our assets, a process that is still very much in progress. I'd also like to specifically point out that many of these examples following are in nongateway markets. This is important, as retail real estate is incredibly reliant on local fundamentals. We strongly believe that the right asset in the right location can have very durable cash flows almost irrespective of the greater MSA. So we may end up keeping some assets previously marked for sale or selling some assets previously marked as keepers. Many investors know well our portfolio of dominant gateway assets, but we also have durable assets in secondary markets worthy of our continued investment. Let me prove this thesis to you. On our slide presentation, you're seeing Cotswold Village in Charlotte, North Carolina. You can see from the aerial photo that this site sits within a dense 3-mile ring with excellent access for convenient shopping. The site is 100% leased and the anchor tenants do exceptionally well. In fact, the grocery store, Harris Teeter, has a gross occupancy cost of less than 2% and high sales drive traffic to the Marshalls, PetSmart, Ulta Cosmetics and a great lineup of shops. You'll note from the chart in the middle of the slide that the shop spaces make up 40% of the site's square footage and that on average, the shops pay rent at 1.65x the average anchor rent. This site, in my opinion, is about as efficient as one could hope for, a great use of square footage for the landlord that will continue to produce above-market growth of 3% to 4%. This is durability. Now let's move to the Boston MSA and look at Everett, Massachusetts. Again, very dense trade area, but instead of a grocery anchor, this site has a dominant lineup of big-box tenants. The convenient access promotes a regional draw to our 640,000 square feet of tenants who do very well. You will note the bar chart explains how the square footage is being used and what the results are for the landlord. That is the percentage of shop space within the entire site is quite low at 19% and, therefore, creates a scarcity value for those tenants that occupy smaller spaces. The result is that the shop tenants must pay a higher rent to get into the site at 2.2x the average anchor rent. Scarcity value continues to drive rents. And although most big-box centers have slower-growing top line revenues, this site will likely generate a consistent 3% as boxes roll options in the next few years and shop tenants must simply pay to stay. As with Cotswold Village, this asset has highly durable cash flows and both properties are great examples of our first investment criteria, naturally growing NOI. Since we just looked at the grocery center and the big-box center, let's look at Brandon, Florida, where we have a bit of both. Regional access draws from a wide trade area and supports Lowe's, Nordstrom Rack, PetSmart and buybuy BABY. But the site has great convenient access for the 3-mile ring and has a very productive Publix, generating close to $700 a square foot in sales and an occupancy cost of less than 2%. These are great fundamentals for a landlord to work with. It's also a great example of our second investment criteria which is an underserved 3-mile ring. The fact is that retail is changing and even quality locations such as this one are losing larger-box tenants with recent bankruptcies. However, look at the percentage of shop space, only 13%. And look at what the scarcity value of those shops has produced, a rent multiple of 2.3x. There's no need to drastically alter this property. But certainly, there's an opportunity to capture NAV growth by better serving the shop needs of the local community. After all, high-volume public sales can easily support a more diversified service and restaurant variety and those tenants will pay rents that justify our redevelopment investment by deboxing and increasing the shop ratio on the margin. One simple concept plan you'll see on the screen illustrates how box tenants can be converted to shop space with higher rents for the same space. It is within existing zoning rights, does not violate existing lease restrictions and clearly, has market demand. Another deboxing strategic example is The Promenade at Brentwood in Missouri. The west side of St. Louis has consistently been a stable submarket. Nearby Washington University and a strong local school system makes this trade area highly desirable. It's also a retail node with both box centers and grocery centers. DDR has the dominant box lineup and more importantly, the company put a Trader Joe's into the site in 2014. The daily traffic volume produced by Trader Joe's has substantially increased the way the site services the 3-mile ring and here is where the opportunity lies. If Step 1 was the grocer, then Step 2 is capturing value created by that grocer. We have an unbelievably low 9% of site square footage allocated to shops. And even worse, we have wasted square feet in the back of the site that could be much more valuable in a better site layout. You can see from our concept plan that a better shop offering next to the grocery store plus a redesign at the rear of the site could substantially change the way this property is shopped. With a shop rent average of 3.3x the average anchor rents, we can profitably increase the NOI in the event we recapture box space over time. There is nothing I respect more in an operating culture than leasing and DDR has a great leasing team. As we focus on opportunities like this, we'll be adding to our team with a focus on shop leasing. It's difficult, but it's highly profitable at the right locations. Another such location is University Hills in Denver, Colorado, this time with a full-line grocer and a powerful lineup of box tenants such as Marshalls, Ulta, PetSmart and Michaels. On the weaker side, there's an Office Depot with low rent. As we consider the long term nature of this site, we recognize that the shop ratio is low for a grocery-anchored property and again gives us confidence that the long term cash flows are durable even in the event of a box closure and we reallocate square footage to be more profitable for the landlord. Again, our concept plan calls for deboxing and increasing our shop offerings with no zoning or existing lease restrictions. Speed of execution is one of the primary benefits of this concept plan. I'll turn to another nongateway property, Midway Marketplace in St. Paul, Minnesota. Our third category of desirable investment criterion is those sites that have the right ingredients for transformational redevelopment. They tend to be older properties with a layout several decades old and a community that has changed around it. I highly doubt you've seen this property featured before as it's not in a coastal gateway market and is decidedly short on curb appeal. But let's look at the facts, Walmart, T.J.Maxx and LA Fitness are all paying rents in the single digits. We have a large discount grocer with a low occupancy cost and strong sales and the shop square footage on the site is only 7%. Now we know that frequent grocer visits produce strong shop demand, but there's another demand driver here. In 1998, a regional rail plan was approved to connect the sister cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. After all, both cities have a CBD employment base and many bedroom communities lie in the neighborhood between the 2 cities. The rail line went through extensive planning and years of eminent domain to acquire the land required to force this path. The street ultimately chosen was University Avenue which runs directly along our northern property edge. And one of the major metro stops selected is at our front doorstep, the corner of our property adjacent to the LA Fitness. Better yet, the rail line opened and became fully operational last year and is currently serving 40,000 people per weekday which smashed estimates by almost 50%. Now we have a transit-oriented site and as many of you know, local governments are usually very supportive of transit-oriented development which means we have an asset with tremendous future upside. We don't yet know how we can access this value, when a project can be started or even what the right design is for the property. But if you look at a conceptual rendering and imagine a transit-oriented mixed-use project situated between 2 major cities, I'm sure you can see why we believe certain nongateway retail assets have highly durable cash flows even in the face of a changing retail environment. Pulling back from our initial examples of interesting properties that we found in our current inventory, I'd like to remind you that we also have a collection of trophy assets in primary gateway markets, properties that are well known to investors. When you combine the trophy assets with the growth potential of the many not-so-well-known properties, we believe we have great opportunities ahead to create shareholder value. Before we take questions, let me recap what we've stated here today. We're committed to making change as decisively and as quickly as possible, but we want to be thoughtful and some things will take time to execute. We came to DDR because we see an opportunity to make change to the capital allocation strategy and improve the balance sheet. We also came because, while we're aware of the enormous fundamental challenges we're facing, we believe the dynamic environment may well create generational investment opportunities. We see our key advantages as being capital-oriented, cash flow-focused, collaborative, creative and contrarian. We believe DDR's portfolio must be modified in the capital-raising process, but it is diverse and can continue to generate positive economic returns for our investors. We're clear on what principles we will use to parse our assets and decide which ones remain or be sold. And finally, we've begun to review the portfolio, finding the beginnings of a redevelopment and reinvestment program that we think will both strengthen assets and yield compelling returns. We're humbled and excited about the challenges and opportunities we're facing and we look forward to sharing more concrete plans and accomplishments in the near future. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator and take some of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital.
Todd Thomas: Just first question. So a lot of your commentary around the retail environment and DDR's portfolio in general just pointed to a lot of the deboxing potential, so that 80-20 big-box small-shop mix that you discussed, where do you think that ultimately should be in your view in the long term? Do you have a target in mind as you begin to think about the portfolio today? And is there a range of annual CapEx required for this type of activity that we should be anticipating or thinking about?
David Lukes: Todd, I would love to give you details on that plan and we're working aggressively to try and figure out what we think the potential is. At this point, to be frank, we've gone asset by asset and we still have a long ways to go, but we're focused on where we can create value. And at some point, we'll be able to express to you all what size we think the pipeline could be for this type of program.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And for the 3 larger bankruptcies that you outlined, the slides were helpful, for Sports Authority, hhgregg and Golfsmith. Can you just talk about the leasing spreads and returns on average that you're achieving on those boxes? And then it sounds like you're expecting those spreads to decelerate. So how much of a deceleration is appropriate to anticipate here as you make your way through the remainder of those boxes?
Michael Makinen: Basically, we're anticipating for each of the 3 bankruptcies we highlighted to have leasing spreads that are all positive, on average, across the group. On the slides themselves, you can see that we actually present our expectations. With Sports Authority, for example, we're anticipating anywhere from a 5% to 10% leasing spread on those. And we’re anticipating similar results on the rest. It really comes down to the timing and the types of tenants that we’re going to anticipate in those uses. But in general, we're looking at about an 18-month period and we're fairly optimistic that, that will materialize.
Todd Thomas: All right. Great. That's helpful. And then just lastly, you've made some organizational changes here early on and I'm just curious whether the platform’s where it needs to be for the long run and whether there are some additional changes to asset management or operations just in terms of how the business is actually being operated or conducted today.
David Lukes: Well, speaking for myself, I'm very enthusiastic about the size of the organization and its structure. As we noted, there really was not a lot of organizational change other than rightsizing the employment base relative to the portfolio today with some room to grow. So I feel very good about what we have today and I don't anticipate that we're going to be responding further based on what we have today in our portfolio.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Yulico of UBS.
Nicholas Yulico: I guess, first question is just putting all this together on the strategy. So your leverage is higher than peers. You're talking about more of a focus on liquidity than leverage now and it seems like there's a lot of CapEx spend that needs to go in to reposition the portfolio. So I'm wondering, as you are wrestling with whether or not to sell Puerto Rico based on pricing, if you did not sell Puerto Rico, what's the pathway towards you being able to reduce leverage, improve liquidity and also have the CapEx spend -- the dollars for your CapEx spend that you need?
David Lukes: Well, bear in mind that -- I would not say that reducing leverage was a backseat. I mean, I think we're pretty clear that we have an expressed intent to use asset sales which we believe we have a good portfolio of to be able to act on that and make a better play of reducing our leverage. The second component in terms of liquidity, I think, we also outlined how we can accomplish that. And I'm not concerned at this point about any specific type of portfolio, for instance, Puerto Rico impacting our overall decision to reduce leverage.
Nicholas Yulico: Okay. I guess just one other question on the balance sheet. Could you just explain kind of what's going on from a cash flow standpoint? I mean, your cash went down versus fourth quarter. Your -- you now have $90 million on the line of credit. You were a net seller in the quarter. So what's going on from a sort of cash flow standpoint sources and uses in the first quarter?
Matthew Ostrower: We had -- well, you can see that we sold about $124 million of face-value properties. I think, it's $118 million at pro rata share. You can also see that we consumed most of that cash in acquisition that was committed to, I think, back in the fourth quarter when it's contracted at that point. So really, I don't think you're seeing a huge net benefit of dispositions in the first quarter. So I think that's -- those are kind of the 2 biggest pieces and of course, we do continue to spend some money on the ongoing redevelopment program, so not to mention tenant improvements, et cetera. So I don't think you saw a huge amount of movement in overall leverage, net cash generation, et cetera, in the first quarter. We obviously intend to change that balance significantly throughout the rest of the year. Does that answer your question?
Nicholas Yulico: Yes. I was just wondering with all that was going on, why, I guess, the revolving credit facility went up and you now have a $90 million balance on that. It just seems like a lot relative to what you may have spent on the redevelopment capital.
Matthew Ostrower: Yes. Look, I think a lot of that will come down to timing of various expenses, et cetera. There's no huge one move in capital spending in the first quarter. So I think that's largely noise. Again, I would think, as the year goes by, you'll see, hopefully, asset sales proceeds significantly overwhelming those other kind of onetime or timing issues.
Operator: The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: So going to your same-store NOI guidance and some of the occupancy losses, I usually wouldn't ask you this question about like 2018 and things like that but given the situation of just your maybe some of the tenants that might be at risk, if you had to describe the overall arc of same-store NOI or occupancy losses and if you tie that into your, kind of, your radar list for maybe troubled retailers, when do you think this negative 1% or 2% same-store NOI starts to reverse course over time or are we at...
Matthew Ostrower: Ki Bin, it's Matt. It's obviously, looking into the crystal ball is hard, right. I think everyone at the moment is a bit uncertain about exactly what the future holds as it relates to tenant bankruptcies. What we've tried to do is kind of lay out the big swing factors for you that we know about, right? And you can see from Page 14 of the deck, you can see that based on what we know today, we see the arc, as you refer to it, as kind of troughing in '17, a significant negative growth. And then we should start to see some rebound in 2018. I think it's very difficult for us to sit here and tell you what the path of tenant bankruptcies is going to be exactly over the course of the next 9 months. That's why we obviously laid out potentially a more negative same-store NOI projection than you would hope in the base case. Clearly, there are some other tenants that we have on our own watch list that would be on all of your watch lists that we worry about. The timing of this stuff has proven to be pretty difficult to predict. Things tend to happen a bit faster and a bit more decisively than in the past. So I guess, what I would tell you is based on what we know now, I would say we're cautiously optimistic that you start to see better growth, same-store-wise in 2018. That could change, obviously, if fundamentals get worse for a variety of the retailers and credit deteriorates. But based on what we know now, '17 should be a pretty tough year and '18 should be a bit better.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. That is helpful. And then the small shop repositioning or demising junior boxes plan, is that very incremental at this point? Or meaning it's only as boxes come back. I'm just trying to gauge if this is -- how meaningful it becomes over time.
David Lukes: I think with the way that you should think about it is that open-air strip centers in good demographic areas have a design. They have a layout and that layout is generating income for the landlord. Our purpose for showing those slides was simply that as things occur in the marketplace, we do have more options than simply finding replacement in the same square footage. And sometimes, many times, those options are accretive, not dilutive. How much there is, how frequently it's used, is it done forcefully or is it done after a bankruptcy occurs I think are all questions on each individual property. But I think the point to remember is that entitled and built square footage which is somewhat flexible, can be a real benefit to an open-air strip center owner as opposed to other types of asset classes.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And just last quick question, I know you don't want to comment too much on asset sales and I totally get that you don't want to negotiate publicly.
David Lukes: But you're going to ask it anyway, aren't you?
Ki Bin Kim: Well no, no. I'm going to ask you in a very, very general way. Is there a dollar amount, so you don't want to talk about specific assets or Puerto Rico, but is there generally a dollar amount that you do want to target? Because that was a big part of the story in the past.
David Lukes: I think that in the coming quarters, we'll probably be able to ring-fence for you a better volume so that you can do a better job of modeling. And it's a little embarrassing to not be able to give you a little bit more than a cannonball fire. But the fact of the matter is, if you look at our 3 criteria that we want assets to fall into, we have to evaluate each of those assets with our leasing staff, who the leadership is in this room today, the property management staff, the financial planning group. And as we go through the assets we can decide, is this a keeper or is this not a keeper. I don't know yet what the full number is going to show. I do know that we're going to overlay that keep and hold list up against a leverage goal of less than we have today.
Matthew Ostrower: I would just add, Ki Bin, to David's earlier comments in the prepared remarks, that we're really weighing the cost benefit here, right? It is expensive to delever if asset prices are really weak, right? And we're going to be looking very carefully at what assets we can sell for what prices. We don't know the answer to that question yet. We're getting out there into the market. We have a lot of exposure there and we're learning a lot very quickly, but for us to sit here now and tell you what that trade-off is going to be, I think, would be a bit too ambitious.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And for the record, I thought the comment you made about holding on to Puerto Rico being an option was actually pretty decent if you don't get the right pricing.
Operator: The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. David, I was wondering if you can just talk about sort of raising common equity and how that ranks in the pecking order because I've heard a lot of different comments. You've talked about shareholder capital is precious. Matt also talked about it's expensive to delever if asset pricing remains weak. I've heard you talk about improving liquidity, lowering leverage, lengthening your maturity schedule, wanting to be opportunistic given dynamic market that could open up for acquisitions which obviously requires you to be much lower leverage and have capital. So your stock price is clearly extraordinarily depressed. How do you sort of weigh that relative to other things and the need to raise liquidity and put yourself in a position to do all these things?
David Lukes: It's a great question. I mean, I'd say that's the topic du jour that we spend the most time discussing and thinking about because I would only pivot a little bit from what you just said the very last sentence. You said, the need to delever. I would say there's a very strong desire. If we term out some of our debt and we're careful about managing it, I think that the coverage we have right now and the dividend is pretty good. And the real issue is that we have a desire to be less levered because we know that opportunities are going to come and we have a team that has a lot of creativity and would like to make investments and make money for shareholders. How we get there is, at this point, a series of potential solutions. And my personal feeling is that asset sales right now are one of the best solutions we have to that. The portfolio is much more diverse than I thought it was a year ago. And that diversity is helpful because there are buyers for different types of assets in the retail space at very good cap rates. So I feel like the delevering is certainly possible to continue as we have been through asset sales. As far as equity issuance goes, we don't have any immediate plans to be using additional common equity at this point. I think throughout time, we'll always keep a bunch of ideas in front of us and figure out what's best at the right time. But as we sit here today, we don't have any immediate plans.
Michael Bilerman: And then I can respect on guidance not having guidance for this year given the transaction activity that you’re going to embark upon, but I'm curious as you think about the more longer term earnings power of this company as you go through the model, getting down to whatever target leverage you want to get down to, rolling in all of the vacancy that's created, where will earnings sort of bottom to when investors can expect to see growth? Is it $1 a share? Is it $0.95? Is it $1.05? We understand the $0.31 run rate is not sustainable, given the vacancies, given the preferred income that's going to go away, given the asset sales you’re going to do given the deleveraging. I think investors sort of want to understand where does it bottom and when does it bottom?
David Lukes: Well, I certainly understand the importance of the question and the severity. And I think that as enthusiastic as investors would be to learn what the trajectory looked like, I think we're more intrigued to learn that. And I think you just have to give us a little bit of time to understand this portfolio. It's not an insurmountable task. It's 151 wholly owned properties. Many of them are very understandable. The people that have been leasing and managing these properties have been at this company, in some cases, more than 10 years. We have a huge amount of information, but it's going to take some digestion to help us understand how that's going to translate into FFO over the long term. But I assure you, we plan to get there. I just don't think we're at the point yet where we can make a comment.
Matthew Ostrower: I would just add, Michael, I mean to David's points previously about urgency. I think we would view ourselves as having done a poor job for shareholders if we went through some long term 3-year miserable death-by-a-thousand-cut deleveraging process and couldn't give you any clarity in the relatively near future. So we get that there has to be a finite window to this. We want to get there as quickly as we can, but I think we would be -- it would be inappropriate for us to give you numbers that we just don't have 100% confidence around yet. We're working as hard as we can to get there.
Christine McElroy: Hi, it's Christy here, guys. Just wanted to get some further clarification on the reduction in same-store NOI and specifically the expected occupancy decline. You did cite the vacancies from recent tenant bankruptcies that had not been anticipated in the prior range. And you talked about Sports Authority and Golfsmith, the downside from which arguably should have been in the prior guidance but then plus hhgregg which I think is only another 50 to 60 basis points impact to occupancy. But the year-end occupancy target was obviously revised down much more to that, much more to a 150 to 200 basis point decline. So just maybe can you walk through sort of the different buckets of that expected decline in terms of tenants just not renewing versus the lease rejections within bankruptcy? Is there risk of more announcements beyond what we already know maybe embedded in there? And is it maybe also reflecting greater downtime or slow re-lease up from The Sports Authority and Golfsmith stuff? Just trying to get a sense for how much buffer there is on the downside here versus the base case on same-store.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks, Christy. I guess what I would say is when we went through this process, I think if you were us, you would have just put previous guidance to one side and looked at the portfolio that you have today, looked very carefully, you would've spent a big chunk of the last x weeks looking at those budgets and trying to understand them and trying to come to your own conclusion about what you think appropriate guidance is and what you think appropriate expectations are for NOI growth or contraction in the portfolio. That is what I can speak to, that's what the 3 factors I tried to give you were, to try to explain to you why there wouldn't be growth this year, why there would be a significant decline. It's very hard for me. We didn't spend a great deal of time trying to go through previous guidance or previous expectations. We spent a lot of time just trying to understand where we think the portfolio will go. So that's -- I tried to be as clear as I could. We tried to be as clear as we could about downtime on the various bankruptcies, the magnitude of various bankruptcies and when you put everything together with Puerto Rico and some one-off anchor departures, kind of, how we get to a potential flat or modest negative growth this year in same-store NOI.
Operator: The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America.
Craig Schmidt: I thought in the prepared comments, you had mentioned a possible spinoff of the Puerto Rico assets. Could you give a little more color on the thinking behind that?
David Lukes: What I said, Craig, is that with respect to the Puerto Rico portfolio, the management team is considering all options. And there are a number of different ways that we consider options but that is, along with others, simply part of an option pool. I don't really have any comments on it. I think any of the options we would consider would have some pros and some cons. But at this point, we're simply learning more about our properties and to the extent that we have any thoughts about which direction we're taking, we'll get more details out after a transaction takes place.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And is there any thought in terms of looking at M&A activity?
Matthew Ostrower: I mean, Craig, just to add on to what David said, again, we're not going to give you a huge amount of specifics on transaction that will be interesting. I know people want that clarity but we're putting absolutely everything on the table. We talked to anybody who wants to talk to us about these assets, anybody who wants to transact, our door is wide open. You can imagine we're out there. People have been -- we've been, as a company, been very public about its intention to think about reducing Puerto Rico exposure. So we've got a big billboard out there effectively. So we're having all those conversations but we're simply not going to give you specific commentary.
Operator: The next question comes from RJ Milligan of Baird.
RJ Milligan: David, I believe you mentioned that 1Q actually came in ahead of budget. And so I just want to clarify those comments because that would probably imply that there's even a bigger delta between the way you underwrote the next 3 quarters and where previous guidance was.
Matthew Ostrower: I'll take that one, RJ. I mean, I would just say that, yes, there was some weak -- we gave you some examples of some ways that we varied from our own internal budget. They were not enormous variances. And again, I really, I can't speak to what previous guidance was. That's not where we put the kind of scarce amount of time and energy that we've got. We didn't put that into reconciling those deltas. So it's hard for me to kind of bridge that gap for you.
RJ Milligan: That's fair, I understand that. Can you guys give us some time line in terms of when you believe the portfolio review will be complete?
Matthew Ostrower: As soon as possible. I mean, I don't know, David, you probably...
David Lukes: Matt saw me struggling, so he answered. That's the risk of sitting across from him. I think we've been here a matter of weeks and we're getting to know a lot of people that know the history of these assets, particularly the leasing staff. We’re traveling to look at the properties. I'd say we're working as hard as we can to try and get through a portfolio review. I don't see it being a protracted long, long process. And I think we've tried to show you a half dozen examples of what we found and what we've learned. So if you take a half dozen and look at the thought process that went into that, you can recognize that it's not a process that's going to take forever.
RJ Milligan: So are dispositions currently on hold as you review the portfolio? Are there certain number of assets that you have in the market that you're planning on selling? How does that work, while you're still reviewing?
David Lukes: We've reviewed more than the 6 that we've shared with you. Some of them, we have established as keepers and some of them we've established as sale candidates. And in that instance, we're proceeding with both the hold and the sale bucket.
RJ Milligan: Okay. And then the -- just any color on the time line for -- I know you guys said as soon as possible, is that a 6-month process, 1 year, 3 months? Any sort of guidance as to when we can expect. I guess what we're trying to figure out is previous management had guided to about $800 million to $1 billion of dispositions and if we get through the portfolio review and it's not a year from now and it's a greater number than that, then there's going to be more dilution in out years. And so I guess, I'm just trying to figure out...
David Lukes: Well, you can certainly reconcile the fact that our primary goal is delivering. It's not an outrageously complicated process to figure out certainly how to keep our program going that we find useful, meaning selling assets to reduce leverage. So I would not assume that our disposition program is going to be negatively impacted or slowed down by the portfolio review process. They'll be concurrent.
Matthew Ostrower: And just to be clear, I want to be very clear, we understand, I think, very clearly, very painfully, we understand what public market expectations are. And I think if we were sitting here today and we had major concerns about our ability to satisfy your and investor expectations around doing this in a timely manner, we would be signaling that to you, right? It's hard for us to be very specific at this point in time. I don't think it's advisable for us to be specific at this point in time. But we intend to meet or exceed people's expectations on this stuff.
RJ Milligan: Last question is, over the past couple of years we've gone through 4 CEOs, multiple portfolio reviews, different shifts in strategy. At some point, the focus really has to shift from any individual management team to the board. And I'm curious as to whether or not we should expect any changes on the board level in the near future.
David Lukes: Well, the board is there to represent shareholders and we work for the board. We consider them our colleagues and our bosses. As you can imagine, we spent quite a bit of time with this board prior to accepting these positions, talking about issues such as leverage and asset quality and future programs and the pros and cons of retail real estate and became comfortable that 3 people, plus a couple of more, decided that this would be a company that we would very much enjoy being a part of. So I think the board to date has been great for us to work with. We've gotten a lot of collaboration and support. And I think I'll leave it at that with respect to the future. We're simply giving them the respect they deserve and asking for advice and counsel, but also sharing our strong opinions about company direction and strategy.
Operator: The next question comes from George Hoglund of Jefferies.
George Hoglund: One question just on the same-store NOI guidance. You guys had mentioned that there's change in methodology with regards to bad debt expense. Is it possible to kind of quantify the impact of that on guidance?
Matthew Ostrower: About 20 basis points.
George Hoglund: About 20 bps. Okay. And then just in terms of kind of the watch list going forward, kind of whether you sort of talk about the top tenants on the watch list or what categories are you kind of worried about for the rest of the year.
Michael Makinen: This is Mike. Basically, when we look at tenants that are at risk, we'd break them into 2 categories, one is that group which requires immediate action and we've talked, obviously on this call in our prepared comments regarding Sports Authority, hhgregg, Golfsmith, I would also add Gander Mountain to that list which has 2 stores in our wholly owned portfolio which has filed. Beyond that, we're basically looking at tenants that we see as at risk and there's 2 ways we deal with it. One way is that we have a team that basically functions as a national accounts management program and a credit analysis program and we're constantly evaluating the financial health of our tenants as well as looking into how they're treating us with regard to renewals and what -- reading the tea leaves as well as getting the detailed information on their credit. The second half of how we deal with it is that we have our field leasing team which evaluates all the spaces and does a detailed backfill assessment. So right now, we're very cognizant of the fact that there are tenants out there who are on the watch list and we feel prepared to be well informed in advance of anything happening and prepared to follow up on backfilling and re-tenanting these spaces.
George Hoglund: Okay. Well, I guess, besides the ones that have already been mentioned, I mean, how much, I guess, is on your watch list in terms of...
Michael Makinen: I'll give you an example of a category that is a very close focus of ours and that is the office supply category. I think it's fair to say that the industry is changing dramatically in how office supply retailers are serving their customers. And we have a significant number of Staples, a significant numbers of Office Depots, OfficeMax in our portfolio. Those are tenants that we're keeping a close eye on, looking at their credit and looking at their individual lease terms in each of the spaces. And subsequent to that and concurrent with that, we're also taking a close look at how we feel we could backfill those spaces and the example that David gave about potentially downsizing the space and doing shops are one of the approaches that we're looking at for all those types of spaces.
Matthew Ostrower: I'll just add. It's really -- we're giving this range because we don't have a list of 3 names that we would say, aha, these are the guys going this year, right? We just don't have that. We have a list like I'm sure you do in your shop of tenants you'd be worried about where there's obvious credit concern. We're giving you a range for a reason and that's because we think there's some uncertainty around that. We just don't know what's going to happen and when.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just a few questions. First, going to the Blackstone impairment that you guys took. Just 2 on that. One, you said it's still cash flowing so just curious, was this a joint write-down that you and Blackstone did in concert so they took an equal write-down on their portion? And then 2, if you're -- if it's still cash flow and your view is that, hey, we're not going to be made whole on this when we do the accounting, we have to just stop recognizing right now versus it's still flowing versus recognizing the income that you're getting cash.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks for the question, Alex. I mean I would say, first of all, I can't speak to what Blackstone is doing. I think it's very possible. So to be clear, as far as we know, this is not a joint write-down. This is something that we're doing on our own. We're using GAAP accounting. It's very possible they'll use a different accounting standard for their books, given that's a private entity, et cetera. So I can't speak to what they're doing but as far as I know, this is just us doing it. To your question around cash flow and you'll see in our supplement we try to make it very clear, there's 2 parts to the dividend and Alex you may know this already but for others who don't, there's 2 parts to the dividend here, right? There is a cash component and there is an accrual component. There's a kind of payment in kind that we get. Nothing around the economics of the portfolio and the cash flows of the portfolio have caused this write-down, right? It's simply a concern that we have around cap rates and the ultimate capital payment we will receive from liquidation of assets and when those payments occur, right? So from a kind of a cash flow and even an accrual standpoint, the economics are basically all the same, they're fine, there's no huge problems there. But when you take as -- it's basically there's some very clear rules on this, when you take a reserve here, when you establish an allowance, the accrual piece, you simply stop recognizing, right? So we will continue to keep track of that. We continue to believe we're owed that by the joint venture, but we're not going to recognize that on our books because we've established an allowance already.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then but if you guys take an allowance independently, does that -- as you guys work with them, does that somehow make it tougher on the relationship? Or it's purely an accounting thing and people see through that?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, I don't expect this to have -- this isn't a relationship component. This is simply us following GAAP accounting rules, really. Whether we wanted to do this or not, we have to do it because it's what the accounting rules stipulate. I don't think anyone would look at us and say, oh, you're being obnoxious about this or something like that. It's simply us responding to the environment and the GAAP accounting rules we have to follow.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is as you guys talked about different efforts to try and sell assets or unwind things, including Puerto Rico and up here, I think one of the things you mentioned was JVs, so in the sense of keeping the portfolio investment grade, the prior management teams have done strong efforts to regain the strength of the investment grade. How do you guys balance dispositions and also potential JVs with maintaining that unencumbered pool that the investment-grade rating is predicated on?
Matthew Ostrower: We'll do what we have to do. It's as simple as that. So we won't get carried away in any particular area in a way that jeopardizes our ability to access unsecured capital which we view as central to this business plan.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank.
Vincent Chao: Just sticking with the Blackstone impairment. It sounds like that was just the cap rate assumption that you guys are worried about. I mean, can you share what the change in cap rate was that caused the $76 million write-down?
Matthew Ostrower: I don't think we're giving out a cap rate at this point. To the degree you have questions about the mechanics, I'm happy to go over that with you off-line. We've given you enough information in the supplement about the waterfall involved here that you can kind of do some of your own math around that. And I'm happy to walk you through that -- how that actually works. It's all out there in black and white.
Vincent Chao: Just on the leverage, we talked a lot about deleveraging a lot on this call. We've also talked about the fact that retail is undergoing some massive changes here today. And I'm just curious. I'm assuming you don't want to give us a leverage target. But some of your better capitalized peers are sort of in the 5x debt to EBITDA range and you also want to give yourself some cushion for potentially taking advantage of dislocations. I mean, is that the right way to think about leverage here over the next, say, 1 year or 2? It sounds like you don't want to let that drag for too long but that's a fairly significant decline.
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, look, I don't think we're going to commit to a target on this call. So we're obviously very aware of where peers are, having been at those peers ourselves, so we get that. I don't think that's the absolute standard. We're not just saying, where is everybody else, we want to get there. I think that can lead to some flawed decision-making, to be perfectly frank. This is going to be really about what capital needs do we think we have which we're still establishing and then what are the costs, right, what are the cost to shareholders of getting to the balance sheet we'd love to have. If we could snap our fingers and end up at 3x debt to EBITDA with no cost to shareholders, of course, we would do that, right? But that's not the world that we live in. So we're getting out there and trying to understand what those costs are. It's a huge part of this equation, not to mention what we think our capital needs are going to be, another thing that we're still spending time on.
Vincent Chao: Let me ask another way. I mean, how do you weigh what it appears to be increasing operational risks just from the environment overall with maybe trying to offset that by taking leverage down even more than you normally would? So forget about what your peers are doing. Relative to the risk of the entire business, how do we think about the right level of leverage? Because I think that's a question that we get. Is 6x okay? Is 5x okay? Maybe it's got to be 2x in today's world, where we're seeing a lot of closures and acceleration of bankruptcies and things like that.
David Lukes: I think we've effectively beaten this horse because our desire is to have a company that can get on its -- the front foot and can make some value-creation decisions. And we're absolutely geared towards trying to get there. At this point, I think we're still confident that we've got some asset sales of things that we don't see the value and can use those. But in terms of the endgame, I just don't think we're in a position to comment on exactly where the numbers should or will shake out.
Vincent Chao: Okay. I got it. Maybe just a different question. I mean, again, just sticking with the idea that things are changing pretty rapidly here. We're sitting here in one of the longest economic recoveries we've had in the history of the country, but yet retail closures and bankruptcy levels are approaching recession levels. You commented that you think 2017 will be the trough. I guess, given that we're seeing this massive amount of bankruptcies today when the economy is otherwise doing relatively well, why are you confident that 2018, things will start to pick back up again?
Matthew Ostrower: I would just say, just based on my previous comment, I'm not trying to express to you that we're highly confident that 2018 is going to be a recovery year and everything is going to be great, right? What I'm trying to say is we don't have really any better of a crystal ball than you or others do. We believe the portfolio can handle additional fallout. We're trying to provide some flexibility in our guidance. Obviously, if we ended up at the bottom end of our guidance, 2018 could be affected by that, especially given the potential timing for these things. So we're really not -- I'm trying not to sit here on a horse, kind of parading a bullish position here on tenant bankruptcies. We just don't really know. It does feel like some obvious candidates have fallen out. There's other ones that are in the press all the time that we're worried about, that you're worried about. We just don't know when it's going to fall out. What we do know is that we've got the right team in place to deal with this kind of fallout. It may have a short term impact to same-store NOI growth, but I think David, Mike and the operating leasing team here, they know how to change assets and how to adapt to this kind this adversity.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI.
Stephen Sakwa: I just want to circle back on the dividend because I'm not sure I heard you correctly. Just in terms of kind of the current dividend and the payout and sort of where you saw that going. Could you just kind of reclarify your comments?
David Lukes: Sure. My comments were that we recognize that the dividend policy is the purview of the board and that from our perspective as management, when we look at our coverage ratio, we feel like there's a reasonably good cushion there. We also recognize that it's one of the benefits of a REIT is a sustainable dividend. And we recognize the importance of it, but we're going to leave the policy decisions up to the full board as we consider that.
Stephen Sakwa: So I guess you look at that as a potential source of capital and kind of rightsize that even if there's sort of cushion. Do you look at that as kind of the first place to look and rightsize that? Or you'd say you can still maintain it even with occupancy going down towards 93?
David Lukes: Well I would say, by definition, it's always part of a dialogue about accessing capital. It happens to be lowest on the priority list, not first. So I guess what I was trying to say about the dividend coverage, if you look at it now, is we feel there's adequate cushion for us to feel relatively confident in the near future.
Matthew Ostrower: Based on what we know today, based on asset sales, deleveraging everything else, we feel relatively optimistic.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly: I appreciate the opening remarks on the business and the industry, David. I was curious, could you talk in broad strokes about how you're thinking long term asset value or same-store NOI growth prospects or power centers as -- on whole, I guess, at this stage of the cycle? I mean, do you see it as sort of a 1% business, 2% business? I'm just curious what your perspective is because given your background at some of the other companies you've both been at, I think I'd be interested in how you're thinking about it now.
David Lukes: It's a great question, Jeff. I mean, I have to admit that personally, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this because there was a time in my career where you could categorize assets by a brand name. It was a power center. It was an open air strip center. It was unanchored strip. It was a net lease property. It was an A mall; it was a B mall. And I think recently we've all begun to recognize that retail real estate takes up a lot of land and it takes up land in vastly different trade areas. Some of them are dense and some of them are less dense. And there's a reason why consumers go to these properties. If the reasons change, the properties should probably change as well. And most of what we're doing here at DDR is recognizing that we've got a very diverse portfolio and we're trying to think a little bit ahead of where we think the retail market is going so that we can be prepared to make changes in how our sites access the demographic in the near term 3-mile ring around it. I personally feel that one of the greatest benefits of retail real estate is the low ABR. When you have square footage in certain environments and only 1/4 of it is built and the rest of it’s asphalt, you have a great benefit of being able to be creative and flexible with the building which is relatively inexpensive to build relative to other types of asset classes. So I would agree with you that the traditional big-box power center with low shops and low pads is generally a slower-growing category than one is with a lot of shops and a daily traffic component. But that doesn't mean it will stay like that. And so as we look at divestitures and future investments, we're looking for properties that I think the square footage is just not being used in the best way for the landlord that it could. And that's without densification. I mean, other assets, you can have densification strategies. But even without that, just moving the puzzle pieces around on the table, I think, can achieve a lot of cap rate value and a lot of cash flow growth.
Jeffrey Donnelly: Understood. And I think -- and I understand your strategy can be different. I think prior management, in some ways, was going the opposite direction. A lot of their dispositions seemed to be limiting that in-line tenant space for the portfolio. Maybe just a follow-up because you referenced it. I mean, the regional mall space is arguably going through a very painful transition. I'm curious how you think that plays out for power centers, meaning that from a valuation perspective, do you think cap rates on core versus commodity power centers -- I guess, where are they going to be today? Where do you think those groups are headed? And from a leasing perspective, how competitive do you feel mall vacancies are for power center vacancies that could be phased? I'm just curious as you sort of plot those 2 versus each other.
David Lukes: No, it's a very good question because I think for the past year or so, people have been using the term shadow inventory. And I think it's an important question to ask ourselves, is what is the impact of potential shadow inventory. Putting cap rates aside, because honestly, I just haven't seen enough transacting to really have a strong opinion about cap rates across the U.S. But if you just simply look at a big box-oriented center in the same submarket as a B mall, there are some pretty big differences. First of all, the cost structure to operate a B mall with enclosed space is significantly different than the cost structure to open air centers. That cost structure is an advantage to the retailer if they're in an open-air environment and that advantage is critical if they need to pay a certain level of rent in order to remain profitable. The second is that I think that the larger power center or the larger big-box collections and we showed one in Massachusetts on our slide, the boxes are so diversified that it's a collection of departments that used to be in the department store. And having that diversity is much easier for a retailer to be able to analyze whether they want to go into the open-air environment adjacent to a bunch of other folks like them or into a merchant mix that relies on a couple of anchors to drive traffic down a certain corridor. So I think that simply the diversity of the anchor profile can make a big difference. Lastly, I would say that the layout does become an important piece of it. And I know that I consistently come back to physical layout. But the fact of the matter is that an enclosed multiple anchor mall which is a 360-degree design, is very different than a traditional open air strip center with respect to visibility and traffic and access. I think in all 3 of these categories, it benefits the retailer if they have a choice to be in a traditional open air layout and not to be in a mall layout unless there is no other alternative. What I'd love to do is look at over the next couple of months whether we can find examples of when did a big-box retailer leave a traditional open-air environment and go into a nearby 360-degree mall location. I bet you, it's relatively small, given how profitable they are in traditional open-air centers. That was a long-winded answer, I know, but it definitely is on our mind.
Jeffrey Donnelly: No, that's helpful. Maybe just 2 quick follow-ups I'm just curious about. On the asset sales, you talked about sort of keepers. I'm just curious, how do you think your keeper list compares to the list of, I guess, I think it was prime assets that was kept by the prior management teams? Is there a significant overlap? Are they kind of wildly different? I'm just curious how that might compare.
David Lukes: I mean, we haven't gotten very far in our vast 7.5 weeks, but we've gotten long enough to kind of understand that there is some overlap. I would say that it's really the lens or the context at which you're looking at a property. If you start with a trade area or MSA, you're going to end up with a different list. If you start with those 3 categories that we laid out earlier about our cash flow growth, I think you're going to end up with a different list. And our tilt is to be much more towards where do we think these assets can grow on a risk-adjusted basis, almost irrespective of the submarket. And I do think that is going to be a distinguishing feature that we're simply not afraid to be in markets like St. Paul, where it's not a traditional gateway market but I think we've seen some ingredients that make the real estate very valuable.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And just one last question. Maybe I don't you want to leave you out, Matt. Just given the prior staffing levels at DDR and I think the level of data analysis that had been undertaken by DDR on itself and at times peers, it seemed to imply that there's a pretty robust, I guess, enterprise information system there on DDR, its assets, its prospects. I guess I'm curious. I know it's only been 7 weeks, but have you found that it's maybe not the case, that maybe your -- one of your first orders of business has been sort of establishing some of that information on the portfolio? Like that's the initial hurdle you're facing and undertaking in assessment at DDR? I'm just curious what you're facing in that aspect.
Matthew Ostrower: No, the systems here, I would say, are pretty mind-blowing. We came from a pretty small platform before, where we had to be extremely cognizant of every single dollar given the G&A that we already had and the base that we had. This company has used scale to their advantage. They have designed some really good stuff. There's really good information available to us. And on top of all that, I would say and even more important, the people who are implementing this, the people who are using it doing the analysis, we've all been pretty blown away by. So it's only been positive surprises from my perspective.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan.
Michael Mueller: I hate to bring up asset sales again, but I'll keep it really short. I guess the question here is, can you talk about how the domestic asset sale plans, how they may or may not be impacted by what you'll ultimately do with Puerto Rico?
David Lukes: I would say that I don't see any connection between the 2.
Michael Mueller: Okay. So if something is not a keeper, it's still not a keeper regardless of whether or not Puerto Rico is sold.
David Lukes: You got it.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.
Christopher Lucas: On the tenant densification strategy, David, I was curious if you could maybe share a little bit about how you're thinking about the timing as it relates to getting the organizational and team in place in order to sort of accomplish that. Do you have that? I kind of think of DDR's organizational structure as being more centralized than probably the typical small-shop-oriented peer.
David Lukes: Well, I would say there's 2 components -- well, there's 3. There's the planning, there's the leasing execution and then there's the physical execution. I think the first part of the strategy, the existing leasing leadership of this company is much deeper than I think we're used to with smaller companies and I think that the opportunity assessment can happen fairly quickly. On the tail end, we have a substantial development and construction department. I must say that that's usually one of the more difficult departments to hire and recruit into. This company has retained some significant talent in both construction and development, so I feel fairly enthusiastic that we've got kind of the gas in the tank to execute on some plans. I think the middle component, you're hitting on something important which is some of us have a passion for shop leasing because I think it's an overlooked benefit to retail real estate. I think historically, this company has been top of the heap in terms of national chain box leasing. I think the relationships here are absolutely stellar. Mike has already gone out with the team and visited with a number of national retail chains at their own company headquarters, doing portfolio reviews. But on the shop leasing front, I think it's a matter of do we have enough people in those positions and are we focusing on those commitments that we want to make to those smaller property types? And I would say we're not quite there. We need to allocate some resources so that we feel like we have those resources on the ground and we'll continue doing that kind of within the teams that the existing leadership has in these different portfolios.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then just a quick one, Matt, on the -- you've got a couple preferreds that become redeemable, the one -- the sure one next. How are you thinking about your preferreds? Is that expensive debt in your mind or is that something you sort of keep around in the interim as you think about how to deal with the rest of the balance sheet?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, I mean -- look, I'll say first and foremost, we're in the process of formulating these plans, right, so I can't give any specifics. We're very focused on duration, right? We said, you can look at delevering which is very important and also very expensive. You can also look at how you manage your liquidity and your overall duration. And I think preferreds can be very useful in that process. So I don't really know the answer yet, but you can see where some of our biases are.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Just a quick question. Are most of the DDR leasing people on salary bonus or commission basis? And I was wondering if you had plans to change that to something similar to what you had at Equity One?
David Lukes: Still under evaluation, Ki Bin.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And just as one last question on the Blackstone preferred equity investment. The $76 million write-down, I mean, if I look at the PIK interest, about $8 million per year, it doesn't come close to that. So I was wondering if, I guess, there is a capital -- there is capital risk with that write-down, is that correct, if I understand that correctly?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, the reserve that we've set aside, so the allowance we've set aside here is about how we mark the assets. So again, it's not really about the dividend or the payability of the dividend. It's much more about what -- if and when these assets are liquidated and we said that we think that they're likely to be liquidated ahead of 2020, 2021 which means that this waterfall in place, we put it in the supplements and you can see it. When they're liquidated, what price do we think we’re going to sell the stuff for and how much money do we think we're going to get back to pay back the preferreds. So it's really a capital question and it's really -- it's our best assessment of where we think particularly some of these secondary and tertiary box assets are trading right now in the markets. And it's -- we did our best on that, no one really knows the answer to what exactly everything is worth.
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy of Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. I was wondering if we can just come back to the board discussion. When you came on, David, Tom came off not only as the CEO but came off the board. Can you talk about how that decision was driven? Was that your desire not to have him on the board? Was it the board's decision not to have him on the board? Or was it your majority shareholder, Otto, that didn't want him on the board anymore? Or was it his own decision that he was fed up and he wanted to get off the board?
David Lukes: I think, Michael, I would just simply rather focus on the future. The decisions at the board level remain at the board level. And all I can say is that we're excited to be here. And I think that's about all I can comment on the subject.
Michael Bilerman: Well, I guess if the board works for shareholders. Now that Tom is off and obviously, Jane had joined, but the remaining board members have a tenure anywhere, call it, an average of 14 to 15 years. If they work for shareholders and the shareholder results haven't been as positive and you guys have come in and communicated a lot of your strong views about where it needs to be. I guess why do you feel that the board doesn't need more change? Why isn't that something that's important to you as the CEO? You said you work for the board, the board works for shareholders. If the board hasn't delivered for shareholders what it needs and the stock price is a barometer of that, I guess, why wouldn't you -- why wouldn't that be a core principle that you have of improving corporate governance?
David Lukes: Right now, the most important things I can think of to spend time on are figuring out how to create value for shareholders on the real estate. We will certainly be spending a lot of time with our board in the next couple of quarters as we get into the strategic direction. And at this point, I'm still very enthusiastic about the reception we've had to date. And the working relationship between the people on the board and ourselves.
Michael Bilerman: And then, could we just review just on the occupancy from an operational standpoint, the 150 to 200 basis point decline in your targeted lease rate from year-end '16 to year-end '17, let's call it 700,000 to 900,000 square feet, by my math. I would have thought Sports Authority would have already been in the year-end number in the lease rate. I guess, can you just walk through that 700,000 to 900,000, how much of that is specific bankruptcies that are known today, how much of it is nonrenewal of the roll and how much of it is just the added conservatism that you've baked in for future store closings, either related to bankruptcy or just downsizing.
David Lukes: Yes, I mean, look, I would say that just like with the same-store NOI, we're giving you a range to work with there, Michael. So some of those are post year-end. We've had one-off. We've got a couple of significant one-off anchor departures and those add up very quickly, right? There could be more of those. We don't really know. We've also had bankruptcies since year-end. We've tried to give you as much data as we can on the total square footage of those numbers. So I think the math is pretty straightforward on that.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley.
Richard Hill: Just a quick question. I appreciate the desire to debox, for lack of a better term. But I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit of insight based on your historical expertise about how much that costs and what are you projecting in terms of a per square foot cost, just average sort of rule of thumb.
David Lukes: I think on a rule of thumb basis, it really does depend on the property. For instance, are the utilities already split in the back or do they have to be subdivided? How does the column grid lay out? Is the storefront made of precast concrete or is it stick frame? They can make the square footage to subdivide go between $50 a square and $250. So it really does depend. I would say that the reason we put those temperature charts in those slides on our deck is to simply point out the fact that when you have at least a $10 delta between the shop rents and the box rents, that usually means that it has the ingredient to at least study it further. So there are some properties that we studied that simply don't have that much of a delta between shops and anchors. And in that sense, we usually kind of put those to the side as we're still trying to find inventory. But you're right, the cost side of the equation then becomes equally as important as the revenue side and in essence, it's just too specific by property.
Richard Hill: Got it. I understood. And so just a point of clarification on my behalf. As I'm thinking about your portfolio optimization and the way you're thinking about that, it's trophy properties, number one; number two, properties that are already well positioned within their given market, such like Cotswold. And then number three, properties that are maybe underserved relative to their current tenant mix and can be deboxed. Is that -- is my understanding fair or am I missing something?
David Lukes: I would say the only divergence I would say from that is that to us, all properties have to fit into one of those 3 categories. They either have to have durable NOI growth on their own or they have a potential to move the square footage around in a deboxing event or thirdly, the land is so valuable that as leases expire, you can densify the properties. It has to be one of those 3. Otherwise, we're simply collecting rent. I mean, we have to create value and the best way to do that is to work on these assets. Trophy properties tend to fall into one of those 3 categories. If a trophy property that someone looks at and says, well that MSA is a trophy MSA, we might find that it simply doesn't have the ingredients that fit into one of those 3 boxes and we might sell it.
Richard Hill: And then I thought your comment about the cost benefit analysis was pretty interesting. And I was sort of comparing it to your comment that you thought there would be pretty interesting opportunities to maybe acquire in the future. And hopefully, I'm not putting words in your mouth there. But as I'm thinking about the opportunity, the cost benefit, how do you think about, for lack of a better term, the opportunity cost and the benefit of selling today at what might look like a distressed price today versus selling tomorrow and it might look more fairly valued? Are you guys thinking through that? How are you thinking about that?
David Lukes: It's funny we haven't gotten to the point yet where I think we have to look at a property and decide, boy, we really want to hold this one, but we really need to sell it. We simply haven't gotten there yet because in my opinion, we're finding inventory that we think is tapped out, doesn't fit one of those 3 categories and therefore, is just a sale candidate, almost irrespective of where you are in the real estate cycle. Because if you're going to sell at a point in the cycle that maybe cap rates are different than they were 12 months ago, on the acquisition and redeployment side, if you find something to put value into, you're likely also to find the cap rates have expanded in that market. So I think you're going to see us be a little bit agnostic to the cycles and probably more focused on where we can create value.
Operator: The next question comes from Paul Morgan of Canaccord Genuity.
Paul Morgan: I was very interested in your comments about the portfolio strategy in nongateway markets and submarkets. But I'm also kind of interested in kind of how you brought your experience at your prior company into that decision, obviously. Is it just sort of kind of doing the best with the hand you're dealt or is there -- are there things you found in the first 7 weeks when you looked at the growth within the parts of the DDR portfolio that you've -- kind of you viewed markets, like you say, St. Paul or others, nongateway markets to be kind of definite holds or submarkets or whatever? Is there kind of any new perspective you've had in kind of in these early days or is there something else, maybe just kind of the pricing disparity or any other reason?
David Lukes: I think if you kind of look at the context of the last 15 years and the different places, the different people sitting around this table here have been, there a lot of experiences that involved secondary markets, different types of assets. And in many ways, the flexibility that DDR has to be able to access those markets and get market information in some ways is a benefit to being a pure play in only 2 or 3 submarkets in the coast, because you lose the transparency to quite a bit of other real estate across the country. So I don't really see it as a paradigm shift that we've been trying to learn or have found. I think it's just if you're in the retail real estate business for long enough, you start to learn about multiple communities across the country. And we happen to have very good real estate in quite a few of them.
Paul Morgan: But even beyond kind of doing the best with your own portfolio currently, are you saying that as you look maybe down the road a ways at kind of incremental acquisitions, you would also see those to be in kind of a similarly broader set of markets?
David Lukes: Yes, meaning if we believe that we can purchase the assets that fall into our 3 categories, we're going to be more agnostic to the submarket and we're going to be more focused on how we can create value.
Paul Morgan: Okay. And just kind of the last little thing. I don't know if I missed this or not. But in terms of kind of the lease spread numbers you provided for the first quarter, in the context of where you see same-store and occupancy, is there any thoughts that kind of -- should we expect lease spreads to be kind of consistent with the first quarter for the rest of the year? Are there any reasons it can move either way?
Matthew Ostrower: To be perfectly frank, that's a number there we're happy to report to you guys. It is not a number that we focus on from a kind of management accounting perspective and an operational perspective. So I can't sit here and tell you we've done a great job forecasting all of those in the next 3 quarters. We'd look much more at cash flow growth. And of course, the cash flow and same-store NOI which is more cash like same-store NOI, is not going to be dependent on spreads. It's going to be spreads from some time ago, from 2, 3, 4 quarters ago, so it's not that we focus that much on short term.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for joining and for your patience in an afternoon call. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."
37,SITC,2,2017,2017-07-26 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the DDR Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day-Anderson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day-Anderson: Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and CEO, David Lukes, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Matthew Ostrower.

At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good morning and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2017 conference call. I'd like to invite everyone listening to join the Events & Presentation section within the Investors portion of our website to follow along with the slide we provided for this presentation. A copy of these slides will remain available on the presentation section of our website following completion of the call today. We've got quite a bit of content to review with you this morning. First we will provide an overview of our second quarter results including our leasing outlook. And then we'll quickly move into a variety of topics related to our repositioning process. We will review the major milestones we've hit so far, highlight some key changes to our balance sheet and guidance, and then review the conclusions of our in depth portfolio review with an eye towards providing some guidance around disposition volumes, the portfolio repositioning process, and our ultimate asset mix. Turning to the second quarter itself, operating FFO of $0.30 per share was ahead of our budget primarily because of lower than expected G&A expense, asset sales timing, and better than expected same-store net operating income. The positive variance in NOI relative to our internal budget was a result primarily of timing related items including earlier than expected rent commitments, several ancillary income items and a favorable co-tenancy resolution. In addition to these non-recurring items, results from Puerto Rico were above budget and bad debt expense was generally lower than expected. We highlighted in last quarter's call that we expected the second quarter to represent the weakest growth rate of 2017 because of the cumulative impact, this quarter of vacancies Sports Authority, hhgregg and Golfsmith bankruptcies. However because of the timing of the factors mentioned, we now expect the trough to occur in the second half of this year. Matt will comment in greater detail on this topic, but despite the change in 2017 same-store NOI cadence we remained very comfortable with our original full-year same-store NOI guidance range. Additionally, without diminishing the importance of contraction in same-store NOI, Mike will review a variety of ways in which we believe we're seeing a return of operating momentum to the same-store portfolio which represents over 90% of our share of the NOI. I'll now hand the call over to Mike to review our operating performance in greater depth.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. We will never be satisfied with the contraction in same-store net operating income, but behind the negative growth, there are a variety of metrics that point to improved future NOI performance. First, the highlight of the quarter was leasing activity. Our volume with new lease in this quarter including pro-rata share of joint ventures was 410,000 square feet at 1,629 per foot with new lease spreads of 10%. We also made substantial progress on a redevelopment pipeline this quarter with leases signed with First Time Market, NCR Trading Post at our Westlake Plaza Redevelopment here in Cleveland. And we remain on track to open Puerto Rico’s first Dave & Buster's at Plaza del Sol year end which we expect to be a significant draw on the island. These strong overall results suggest that while we may have experienced an increase in tenant bankruptcies and store closures, demand for space in our portfolio remains high enough to produce strong releasing volumes. Diving into these metrics, you'll see that while new and releasing spreads were within historical norms, the CapEx associated with new leases has risen. This is the result of releasing of anchor spaces especially those resulting from recent tenant bankruptcies. Now well some quarters will be better than others, it would be normal for leasing CapEx to be elevated and net effective rents to be somewhat lower as we recover from bankruptcy related anchor vacancies. Importantly, shop economics remained attractive this quarter with CapEx and net effective rents in line with historical trends. As David mentioned, the decline in same-store NOI was largely a result of store closures generated by significant tenant bankruptcies. This same phenomenon caused our quarter end lease rate to decline 60 basis points sequentially to 93.7 primarily as a result of hhgregg closures this quarter. We continue to expect the lease rates to trough in the third quarter. Our leasing pipeline remains robust specifically across the aggregate portfolio; we have 280,000 square feet of anchor leases and 240,000 square feet of shop leases currently in negotiation suggesting we should be able to sustain this historically high level of leasing activity reported in the first six months of the year. All of this momentum has translated into measurable progress on refilling vacancies created by Sports Authority, hhgregg, and Golfsmith with eight new leases and LOIs completed in the second quarter. In order to sustain this momentum, we have launched an initiative to redouble our focus on vacant shop space which we believe represents a $40 million NOI opportunity in this portfolio. We are expanding our leasing team and spending significantly more management time in this area. Demand for all of the space may see surprising in the current environment but it is not when considering our high exposure to tenants benefiting from the shift of the American consumer to discount oriented merchandise. This means that we're seeing deals not just with the usual suspects in this category, T.J. Maxx, Ross, and Burlington but newer and more quickly growing discount and specialty entrants like Aldi and Leedle, Totaline, Fresh Time, Hobby Lobby and Alta. We also executed two leases with Dick's Sporting Goods in Evansville, Indiana, and West Long Branch, New Jersey. With that, I would like to hand the call back to David, who will review some of our milestones today.
David Lukes: Thanks Mike. I'll now review with you some of our key achievements over the past five months. Our first month was focused on ensuring we had the right number of people in the right positions and the result was not just a significant cut to our G&A budget and reduction of overall staffing, but also the promotion of some of the strongest existing members of the DDR team. We remain highly focused on corporate costs especially those not specifically associated with headcount. We then turned our attention squarely on the balance sheet. Last quarter, we highlighted a significant work we could do ahead of dispositions to reduce maturity risk and we have since made progress on this front. Specifically, the $450 million 10-year bond and a $175 million perpetual preferred offerings that we executed in May and June resulted in a balance sheet that is much better positioned for capital markets volatility. Matt will provide more color on this momentarily. With our debt offerings completed, we continue to focus on the portfolio review process and executing on existing key transactions. I'd like to highlight our key accomplishments in this area. First, we closed on the restructuring of the DDRM or Manatee joint venture. This transaction resulted in a variety of benefits including demonstrating strong pricing for a key DDR portfolio, accessing attractively priced CMBS capital for a large retail portfolio, and demonstrating the sustainability of profitable and strategically valuable joint venture fees. We've also joined forces with Madison International, a highly sophisticated partner for the portfolio with whom we look forward to a long and productive relationship. Second, we closed over $200 million of dispositions in the quarter at a sub-8% cap rate pushing net debt-to-EBITDA down to 6.5 times from 7.0 times and demonstrating that the markets for retail assets including power centers remains active. We closed an additional $115 million of dispositions since quarter end as detailed in our supplemental including a $90 million portfolio in our Blackstone joint venture and are in negotiations on additional assets. We remain optimistic about our ability to transact given the quality of assets in our disposition pipeline. Third, included in the second quarter dispositions, were two assets in Puerto Rico that we sold for a combined $57 million at a low 8% cap rate. This transaction allows us to continue to manage our exposure to the island in the phase of domestic dispositions and demonstrates that there are avenues for reasonable transactions on the island. As I said on our first quarter call, we are not a distressed seller and double-digit cap rates for the remaining even higher quality portion of the portfolio is simply not realistic. We will continue to manage our Puerto Rico exposure in a thoughtful manner that protects our shareholders value. Finally and most importantly, we finalized our portfolio review, we now have not just a complete list of the assets we'd like to sell in the deleveraging process but a list we believe is saleable at attractive prices in today's environment. We expect to raise roughly $900 million of pro rata proceeds asset sales from April 2017 through mid next year, including $200 million that closed in the second quarter. We expect the end result of this process will be a reduction in our debt levels to about six times debt-to-EBITDA on a pro rata basis. I will return to our findings from this process in just a moment but first I'll hand the call over to Matt to review the changes in the balance sheet as well as some thoughts around sources and uses over the next year.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks David. We've made some noteworthy progress on the balance sheet in the last several months but have plans for further improvement or such on those in order. In terms of what we've gotten done, the financings we completed in May and June accomplish several goals, first our 10-year bond in preferred equity transactions demonstrate DDR's access to capital at attractive prices. Second and perhaps more important it serves to de-risk the balance sheet. We moved from a position of having too much debt maturing in the near-term to being able to absorb three years of maturities without needing further access to the capital markets even in the absence of additional assets sales. Finally, we increased our average debt at preferred duration from being one of the shortest in the sector to one of the longest at nearly eight years including preferreds. Looking forward, completion of our planned dispositions would position us to have one of the best balance sheets in a shopping center REIT space. Debt-to-EBITDA on a look through basis would end up just below six times, a more modest level on a year or two ago and in line with the peers. But we would have other differentiating changes as well including virtually no consolidated secured debt among the lowest level of bank debt exposure and average debt duration among the highest in the peer group and no significant maturities for over three years. The planned repayments of 2017 and 2018 mortgage debt should unencumber over $550 million of gross book value and eliminate mortgages with a 19% average debt yield. We've got a lot of wood to chop on the dispositions front but if we succeed, our balance sheet will be very well positioned to allow the company to take advantage of investment opportunities. I'd like to now turn from the balance sheet to 2017 guidance, which we are leaving unchanged despite stronger than expected second quarter results. On same-store NOI, we are leaving guidance unchanged largely because of a range of offsetting factors. First our NOI outperformance in the second quarter was attributable primarily to several timing-related factors including one earlier than expected rent commencements; two, favorable ancillary income results; and three a favorable one-time co-tenancy resolution. There were also some more sustainable sources of the positive variance including generally better than expected results from Puerto Rico and lower than expected bad debt expense. Offsetting the generally positive impact of second quarter numbers are several smaller tenant bankruptcies that occurred following our last conference call in April including Gordmans, Vestas, and Gander Mountain. A third factor that will likely impact annual same-store NOI performance is our ongoing dispositions process. We have several asset on the market that we recently finished releasing and therefore have higher 2017 NOI growth rates. While the decision to sell these properties is the right long-term decision for DDR, the exclusion of these assets from the same-store pool when they are disposed could negatively impact our reported annual same-store NOI growth. Summing up, we remain extremely comfortable with our guidance range, but we also expect our growth rate to trough in the second half of the year rather than in the second quarter previously. I'd like to also point out three modeling items. At quarter end, we had $414 million of cash on the balance sheet and $61 million of restricted cash. $310 of this cash was used to retire the April 2018 bonds in the second week of July and we will retire all of our remaining 2017 maturities $126 million of mortgage debt with the balance of the cash at first week of August. Additionally, as part of the April 2018 bond redemption, we paid make-hold charge of $7 million which we will recognize in the third quarter. Lastly included in the quarter was $1 million of base rent from bankrupt tenants that we will not receive in the third quarter. And finally, before handing the call back to David to discuss the completion of our portfolio review process, I'd like to touch briefly on sources and uses for the next four quarters. We expect to achieve our target six times debt-to-EBITDA goal by raising $900 million of pro-rata proceeds from dispositions including $200 million that closed in the second quarter. We intend to use proceeds from these sales to repay mortgage debt maturing in the next two years, the $200 million secured term loan outstanding, $200 million of the $400 million unsecured term loan, $82 million of unsecured bonds maturing in 2018, and $100 million of additional mortgage debt. While there will be a cost to shareholders from this activity to benefit is a much better balance sheet positioning DDR for future growth. This analysis does not factor in proceeds from the redemption of any Blackstone preferred. We view disposition proceeds and Blackstone preferred proceeds as interchangeable. Should combine proceeds exceed our de-leveraging goals, we would expect to reinvest excess capital. I would like to now hand the call over to David for a summary of findings from the portfolio review process.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. I'll take a few minutes to describe the results of our portfolio review process which we began discussing last quarter as well as what this means for our dispositions and capital allocation decision making going forward. As I said to you last quarter, we view each property like most investors view any investment they're making which means understanding the cash flow growth profile and the risk associated with achieving that growth, we are highly reliant on factors like location, site, and rent roll, and we are much less focused on the property MSA, the average base rent per square foot or specific retail format. These considerations can be broken down into specific qualitative and quantitative factors. On the quantitative side, we focus on the consumer within the assets specific trade area to measure four factors: number one, the spending power; number two, the gap between the centers in place rent and market rent; number three, the number of trips that consumers make to the center to measure its ability to attract convenience type tenants; and number four, the density of the asset or the SAR to measure site efficiency. On the qualitative side, we gauge the attractiveness of the intersection on which the asset is located. The assets visibility, the layout of the center, and of course the properties merchandise mix, which is an enormous factor in determining the assets consumer drawing power. Assets that screen well on these qualitative and quantitative aspects are those that are candidates for being part of the DDR portfolio over the long-term. With the assessments now complete, we can much better understand how the portfolio fits into the three buckets. We discussed in the first quarter call durable, growth and redevelopment. We believe roughly 66% of our NOI falls into the durable category which we see as assets with stable cash flows but more modest upside. These assets include our portfolio of ground leases and single-tenant assets, a wide range of more convenience oriented properties and perhaps the largest group, those assets that represent dominant locations and that offer very low occupancy cost ratios to their tenants. Our dispositions fall almost entirely into this durable category with a very few exceptions, we are selling them not because we believe they're risky but because of our de-leveraging goal. We will however use the de-leveraging process to sell lower growth rate assets and improve the impact of the higher growth assets we intend to keep. Roughly a quarter of the NOI fits into the growth category. These are properties that we believe have some financial upside because they're currently under serving their three mile trade areas that have an opportunity for profitable re-tenanting with high productivity merchants and those with recent box vacancies that we believe can be filled at an attractive mark-to-market rent. And finally, we believe about 10% of the portfolio falls into the third redevelopment bucket that we described last quarter. These assets should have the highest growth rates because they present significant densification opportunities significantly below market rents or an opportunity to optimize their overall formats. Just to make it a bit clear, how we're screening and making these decisions on assets. I'll review an example in each category. When we state that 66% of our NOI falls into the durable category, it's fair for investors to ask exactly what gives the confidence in the security of these cash flows in a challenging retail atmosphere especially in non-gateway markets. Polaris Towne Center in Columbus, Ohio, is a great case study. The Aerial photograph shows that the center has high visibility a long and simple layout and a convenient shallow parking field with multiple access points. The tenant roster includes a Kroger grocery store on one end, Lowe's and Target on the other and a strong collection of junior anchors and shops in between with well located pad buildings along the main access road, convenience, cross shopping, and visibility are the key ingredients for strong tenant sales. This is a great qualitative set up for the quantitative analysis which is primarily about rents and sales numbers and how they support the stability of the landlord's economics, so here are the numbers, Kroger's has a low-single-digit rent and an occupancy cost ratio of just 1.7% but their low rent is also flat for the next 21 years. Durable low anchor rents means economics must come from elsewhere and in this case it's the junior anchors and shops. Like several other junior anchors here, TJX has very high sales and a low 3.5% occupancy cost ratio. This sets us up for some strong shop rents which are indeed 130% higher than the junior anchors. But this high rent is also a product of shop scarcity only 20% of the center space is not anchored. This all means strong but limited shop economics. A near term OfficeMax expiration with a large mark-to-market rent opportunity even provides upside within the junior anchor category. And finally over $700,000 of NOI is coming from ground leases on single-tenant pads which carry an inherently low cap rate and tend to be stable below growth. Summing this up at 99% occupied, Polaris is a very high quality but also low growth property. Growth assets have similar qualitative factors but more financial upside. Consider Tanasbourne Town Center in Portland, Oregon, again exceptional location and visibility along with easy access and convenient site circulation, a strong anchor base of Nordstrom Rack, Target, Ulta Cosmetics, and Ross, generate strong consumer demand and traffic. You're going to note a scarcity theme with shops in our DDR presentations and this site is no different with only 20% of the GLA allocated to shops, the shop rents are 180% higher than the anchors. This property fits into our growth portfolio because we've recently executed leases to de-box and backfill a vacant Hagen, so the NOI growth here will be above average over the next year or two as occupancy rises back to 99% and new rents commence mid next year. This case study also demonstrates that DDR's high leasing volumes have been associated with good inventory in great properties made available through tenant bankruptcies. Speaking of the best real estate about 10% of our NOI comes from properties that we see as a yielding land place with greater densities in their future. A sneak preview of one such asset is Sandy Plains village just outside of Atlanta, Georgia, in Roswell. The property’s ugly appearance and anchor vacancy make it easy to overlook but surrounding demographics are strong and the site is one of the few open air and low density properties in an otherwise wealthy residential community. We have a strong movie theater with low occupancy cost many of our shops roll lease terms with no options in the next few years and the anchor vacancy is actually a dark and pain Wal-Mart that controls over 30% of the land, these are all great ingredients for redevelopment potential. Our executive team spent a day on the site a few weeks ago with our Atlanta office and we're all excited about the possibilities. Before we take questions, I want to briefly discuss our dispositions program. Previous management at DDR did an excellent job disposing of risky assets and you can see we made further progress this quarter paring back the portfolio. We're working hard on leasing. We're making progress on asset sales, our capital allocation is firmly geared towards de-leveraging and the portfolio review process has given us more clarity on our future growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: First question in terms of the operating environment, can you comment on whether there's been a change in your conversations with retailers since earlier in the year around closures and concessions. And then can you just comment on the deceleration in trailing 12 month leasing spread just taking place there over the last few quarters, is there any visibility around a stabilization there or should we anticipate a further deceleration on leasing spreads?
Michael Makinen: This is Mike. I'm going to break that answer into two phases. The first is comments related to kind of the tone of the tenants we've been talking to and I will say that while there is definitely a negative side of the tenants commentary, the tenants with whom we're doing deals has actually been quite aggressive and quite enthusiastic and aggregately we across the board we're not releasing any slowdown in the rate or the momentum of leasing. As far as leasing spreads, I still think that that tends to be a little bit bumpy and occasionally you're going to have some quarters with lower spreads some quarters with higher spreads but I really don't see a longer term trend shaking out that I would anticipate to carry forward on leasing spreads.
Todd Thomas: Okay and then Mike the $40 million base rent opportunity that you mentioned from leasing vacant shop space, where does that take the lease rate for that segment of the portfolio, I guess less than 10,000 feet and sort of what's a reasonable timeframe to get that lease rate up and recognize the value there. And then also just what was preventing the company from leasing that space previously?
Michael Makinen: Well I think I'll answer that in two pieces as well. First of all with regard to our past history, I think the company has always been quite good at leasing shop space but I also think that it has been treated a little bit more as a secondary growth vehicle relative to anchor spaces and I think that's really where the fundamental change is going to be taking place in that the shop space is going to be treated with just as much aggressiveness and just as much focus and reward as the anchor space. As far as where I think the spreads go, I think there's great roster of shop tenants out there on national franchise tenants and national tenants, who I think will actually help our leasing spreads.
David Lukes: Todd just to be a little more specific, I mean we're not going to give our guidance on exactly what we're going to capture that, we're starting this process, we're very focused on it, we will give you more clarity when we have it but I think the main message here is we smell some opportunity it's hard to know exactly how much of that will get and when at this point.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then just lastly, so the lease rate for the portfolio is expected to come in from the 93.7% at June 30. Do you have any sense I’m just trying to understand whether the bottoms in the third quarter and begins trending higher into year-end with a view in the 2018 or do you think that we continue to see the portfolios lease rate trend lower from 3Q into 4Q?
David Lukes: Yes. I would say based on what we can see today is troughing next quarter, so in the third quarter. I would say that from there we holding things exactly where they are today, we definitely see the ability to start making background particularly into 2018, as we talked about before. I guess the big wildcard there obviously is for the tenant bankruptcies which you and I have probably about the same amount of visibility on.
Operator: The next question comes from Christian McElroy of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christian McElroy: Just in the context of the portfolio review and asset sell plans of the $900 million that we should expect over the next year including Q2, we obviously know the breakout of the first $200 million but of the remaining given that you've sort of completed the review, can you talk about how much of that you expect will be in Puerto Rico versus the U.S. and how much of that could potentially be your share of sales in the Blackstone JV?
David Lukes: Hi Christy, good morning. With respect to the dispositions, I think you have to look at it from our perspective and recognize that we've taken every property in the country and Puerto Rico and putting it through a bottoms up analysis simply to put into one of those three buckets, so Puerto Rico I don’t see it is any different than the remainder of the country where we've got properties in three buckets, the ones that tend to be the lowest growth, the ones that we think we've kind of achieved maximum NAV, and the ones that are transactables are the ones that make the most sense to sell. So I don't think we have a breakout for you as to how much by property type or by location is within that number, I think you can rest assure that it’s going to tend to be the low growth assets that we're looking to dispose of.
Christian McElroy: Okay. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for what how you're viewing Puerto Rico exposure and kind of where you expect to be in terms of ownership at mid-2018 it seems like the two assets that you sold were not among your top assets on the island, and given that you sold them at a Lowe I’m wondering what that sort of implies for the value of your remaining assets in your view of that and the potential demand environment for additional transactions there?
David Lukes: Right. Well let’s look at a couple of interesting facts about the two properties we sold, the one of them is about an hour and a half from our office. These two properties are effectively the only ones of any great size, that don't have a Wal-Mart or a grocery store. When we look at the properties in Puerto Rico we see a lot of extremely high volume tenant sales particularly coming from Wal-Mart. We still see a lot of consumer traffic; we see plenty of sales volume that's driving some decent profits for the tenants. And I think we also have the best operating staff on the island. I mean if you spend time with our portfolio folks there you pretty quickly come away very impressed and so as an operator, I think it's our job to make sure that we’re extracting every bit of NOIs we can out of that property. But in the context we have to manage our relative exposure as a company especially in light of selling down assets in the U.S., our relative exposure goes up. So that's not, that's not lost on us. The reality is that I do think there is a market for reasonable transactions in Puerto Rico. I think we're open to continuing some of those transactions. But without any specific information, we're going to continue to operate these properties with the same vigor that we do in the U.S.
Michael Makinen: So Christy, we're just -- we're not going to give specific Puerto Rico guidance given health in the market is et cetera, I think our message remains the same there which is we will tell you about it once we've done stuff with the overlying theme that we understand we need to manage exposure.
Operator: The next question comes from Craig Schmidt of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schidmt: Great, thank you. I was just looking at the same-store metrics on the supplemental. I noticed that the base rent was up 0.4% on a DDR share basis but recoveries was down 1%. I was wondering why the recoveries would be down?
Matthew Ostrower: I don't know the exact answer for that question, Craig. I would say that there is some noise in the numbers this quarter based on some settlements that we had et cetera, so that kind of the recovery ratio is not kind of a perfect number to look at going forward. So I think it’s little bit annoyed I can get back to you on some of the exact sources there.
Craig Schidmt: Okay. And then do you see the activity in the limited small shops that yes the portfolio has improving by the trend of the end of the year.
Michael Makinen: I'm sorry did you say improving by.
Craig Schidmt: Just the rate of least spreads and occupancy in the small shops.
Michael Makinen: We're undertaking an initiative right now and I'm hopeful we'll start to see some results on that by the end of the year but it'll be a longer process within that.
David Lukes: And quite just a circle back to your previous question do you want to --?
Christa Vesy: Sure, this is Christa Vesy, Craig just let you know recoveries are really tied to with the spending is at the property so that has a seasonality pattern to it. So you're going to see a little bit more noise tied to spending I wouldn't say any sort of negative trend in anyway just more timing related.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: I guess as it relates to the Puerto Rico sales I realize it's not an overly deep market but could you maybe just describe kind of the process and maybe the number of bidders that ultimately took a look at some of these assets.
Michael Makinen: I think that, the fact that we transacted with a private buyer and what I would call a successful -- successful process is probably good enough right now, Steve. I think that the markets are pretty, pretty small. I think a lot of people know each other and we've built a lot of good relationships over time with this company a number of folks that work here for a long time have some great relationships on the island and we're continuing to talk to anybody that that has an interest in some dialogue.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. I guess it relates to $700 million of future sales I realize you're not being too specific on timing but can you tell us if you've got any of those assets currently being marketed.
Michael Makinen: Well, I think what we have given time and on the 700 million that we have a target for mid next year and I think we're feeling pretty good about our momentum but we haven't said is what percentage of that is in what location and I think we'd rather just remain silent until we transact.
David Lukes: But we are we are in negotiations on properties today Steve with riding through -- with the right levels of progress there whether it's you know purchase and sale agreement or otherwise. We definitely there is a pipeline of ongoing like it's going to kick off as of today.
Steve Sakwa: I guess my question was this all $700 million of that currently being marketed and it would close over the next call it 9 to 12 months is that.
David Lukes: I wouldn't say the entire $700 million is currently in the market it as you know this is a kind of a -- it's a process right so it depends on exactly how you define that. We definitely assess the salability of all of it using brokers et cetera so, if we definitely make progress on the whole thing how far we get an exactly when is -- we're not, not saying it because we're hiding something it's as you know these transactions is very difficult to predict.
Steve Sakwa: Okay and I get.
Michael Makinen: Steve some of it is just is making sure that, when you market a property for sale you need to have gone through the proper preparation I mean for instance if a large anchor tenant has an option exercised this December first we're either going to try and negotiate an early renewal or we're going to wait till the option is exercised and then there's a five-year term left because the CMS debt is going require that from a buyer. So some of the sales process is kind of paced out over the next six months before we market properties.
Steve Sakwa: Okay. And then just lastly in terms of sort of CapEx that you guys talked about and highlighted the higher CapEx on the new deals I think renewals are maybe not up as much but when you just sort of think about big picture kind of maintenance CapEx CI and leasing commission as a percentage of NOI is there sort of a ballpark number that you think is a reasonable run rate on a go-forward basis for the portfolio.
Matthew Ostrower: I think it's a really tough question it's obviously it's one of the $60,000 question but I think, I would tell you that, we do feel comfortable with is that as we do the anchor deals is going to be higher right kind of where it is today to go a little higher the lower but it's going to be a bit more elevated levels. The real questions up that - is what does the bankruptcy picture look like right if we continue to see this very high level of bankruptcy is obviously that long-term run rate is going to be quite a bit higher. If things taper off here and we've kind of gone through a cycle and we get through the -- we've gotten through the difficult part of it then obviously you're going to be down at the lower level. You can see I mean it over the course of the company's history you've seen this number cycle before right so, I would say at least in our experience that CapEx is, is rather cyclical and trying to choose a long-term number kind of depends in where you are in a cycle.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Two questions. First just wrapping up on Puerto Rico, I think you guys said that the sales were somewhere in the A cap range and based on your comments it doesn't seem like you're that you're that -- it seems like you’re more I guess easier to say is that the headlines of the fear in Puerto Rico and the NOI impact there seems to be less a concern for you guys versus maximizing the price, in other words you're fine keeping the assets and it almost sounds like the pain in the rental roll down that the island has experienced may be flattening out such that you're fine keeping those assets is that a fair assessment.
David Lukes: The certainly from a price perspective I mean I think if you -- if you tour properties for a living and you go to Puerto Rico and you look at the rent rolls and you watch the tenant demand and you see where the properties are located and you look at relative impact of internet sales you feel very positive about the fundamentals of what we own on that island. And so I think that from a from a shareholder perspective, shareholders should expect that we're treating their currency with a lot of respect and I think these properties deserve to be priced accordingly not in a fire sale manner and I do believe that long-term and even, even as recently as last month there are buyers that also find value in an NOI. So I think you're right that we do feel a little more positive and a little more protective of the value we have in that island. The flipside of what you're saying I'm probably a little bit more sober on and that is that the rent roll downs on the immediate short-term operating fundamentals in Puerto Rico are very difficult. The number of tenants that are seeking to backfill certain sizes of spaces is more limited than it was before. Part of that because we, we might be in a little period of time here where for in the U.S. retailers are simply not expanding on the island now that might change. But I don't -- I don't think it's a long-term damage I think it's more of a couple of years where we're looking at individual leases burning off and it's going to be a little bit of a bumpy ride. We've got a couple of leases coming online in the next year that are huge positive impact in Puerto Rico. Dave and Busters are one of them. We also have a couple of office depots that mature over the next year that have big roll downs and so it's a little bumpy a ride but we've had enough time to focus on the cash flows and really believe that we understand the long-term value of the NOI.
Michael Makinen: We are looking at on asset by asset base and right so it's -- it's not about a emergency sell the entire thing tomorrow in order to solve an IR issue it's about understanding each asset. Some assets look great, some assets less so it's going to be a much more to granular exercise but we are going to manage our exposure there.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And the second question David as you mentioned some cost saves outside of, corporate G&A et cetera so are there cost saves in the field whether it's regional offices or maybe more use of third-party brokers or things like that could you just discuss some of those other cost saves beyond the corporate overhead.
David Lukes: Yes, I think specifically I was mentioning non-headcount G&A, recurring G&A that runs through on a corporate level. And whenever you have a company that has sold as many assets as we have over the past couple of years there are opportunities to look at how we use office space where people sit, how they work together our IT department are outsourcing of certain functions with a G&A budget the size of ours we feel confident that we can find some cost savings, if we simply focus on it. Some of that is in the field but I would say quite a bit of that at the corporate level as well.
Alexander Goldfarb: Is there a number that you would identify?
David Lukes: No.
Matthew Ostrower: No.
Operator: The next question comes from Vincent Chao of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: David may be a question now going back to the different, the three different buckets that you outlined, obviously durable being the lowest growth I guess can you comment on sort of relative difference in growth do you expect between the three buckets and what the right mix is longer-term and then as far as the longer-term growth algorithm is it really just a matter of recycling those durable and once you get the growth assets stabilized in the redevelopment stabilize they become durable and you just keep rotating overtime.
David Lukes: Yes. I think the latter part of the latter part of your question is the correct way for you to think about how we're thinking about a portfolio if we have long-term flat ground leases that are growing at you know half a point is probably is viewed more as a source of capital for us in the long term than it is growth for the company. Our job is to make money in retail real estate and we fully intend to be putting a lot of hard labor into redevelopment and in repositioning particularly leasing which happens to be the easiest way to make money in real estate and we're going to be using lower growth assets over time as a source of capital. So I think that's probably the right way to look at putting specific ranges of CAGRs is a little more difficult simply because the top of the bucket, the redevelopment side is going to have a pretty outsized growth pattern but also a lot of capital involved. The middle section I think we'll have a very outsized performance but it's for a period of time because some of that is because of recent box vacancies where we have some lease-up potential. So I think it's a little bit I would feel uneasy putting specific target in each one of those categories.
Vincent Chao: Okay. I guess maybe a different way, I mean just from a mix perspective I mean once you're done with the dispositions which are largely in the durable bucket, is that likely sustain more mix going forward or does that just depend on the times in the cycle?
David Lukes: I would just say we have the cost of capital and we have a return requirement that we need to hit over time for shareholders right and that will -- so the mix that we have to some degree will be dependent on what we think the growth rates of those assets are going to be given where we are in the cycle right and our ability to hit our cost of capital. So we can more aggressively or less aggressively recycle that capital to try to achieve better returns for shareholders depending on what the existing assets are going to be able to do. We're sitting at a point of cycle right now with the fair amount of uncertainty, with the fair amount of vacancy et cetera. So I think it's going to be, there is going to be an evolution, it is hard for us to know exactly what it’s going to look like.
Vincent Chao: Got it, got it. Okay and maybe one last question on the same-store NOI growth troughing in 2H, we talked about this little bit earlier, it sounds like the current expectation is 3Q trough in lease rates beyond unknown bankruptcies and leaving some wiggle room for that, is there anything else that would cause the same-store NOI to trough be in the fourth quarter versus the third?
David Lukes: Yes I mean look there is -- I think there is a temptation to engage in some false precision here, right. Things move exact to our rent commencement dates and two or three anchors change rent commencement dates a couple of different months that can change or exactly due trough right. We do have -- we're going to have a couple of incremental vacancies that we know about that we know about for a while that are going to happen, one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter. So I think my level of conviction that is exactly the third quarter is not terribly high. But I think you should look at that, we said the second half deliberately because I think it's not totally clear which was going to be. I would expect some negativity, some negative growth probably in both quarters.
Operator: The next question comes from Caitlin Burrows of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Caitlin Burrows: I was just wondering if you could talk about Ascena obviously they are a decent tenant of yours and large kind of across all of the retail REITs and they recently announced they were going to go through some either foreclosures rent roll downs over the next few years. So just wondering what exposure you had to those leases expiring by mid-2019 and if you started those discussions with them?
David Lukes: We have certainly started discussions with them. We have about 100 stores throughout the various brands and right now it's in the very early stages and it's pretty difficult to determine exactly how things will shake out but we're all over it from the standpoint of both discussing with them as well as focusing on any backfill opportunities for situations we think may end up needing to be replaced.
Caitlin Burrows: And I guess as they've kind of said that they would either close the store at the end of the lease or look for roll down, do you have any idea of how kind of I guess willing you are to accept the rent roll down versus go out and resell?
David Lukes: Every single location is depended on the supply and demand of that market demand for the space, every single situation is treated independently store by store. So I don’t really have the ability to give aggregate answer for that.
Matthew Ostrower: Just as a point of clarification, it’s 1.3% of our ADR on a pro-rata basis.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it, okay. And then I know this might have kind of been asked already but just in terms of same-store NOI this year obviously the guidance range is for down at the midpoint and that would be a first time since 2009 and you guys even mentioned that the previous management team did do a pretty good job at turning the portfolio, so wondering just going forward when you think about long-term potential growth of the company, do you see it getting to positive territory and at what point might we be able to see even maybe like a 2% to 3% positive growth?
David Lukes: I think speculating on the long-term will be difficult, I would just remind you that yet as a management team that's been in the industry for a long time, I think we've seen a number of cycles and have kind of a general feeling as to how -- how much water is in the tub and the economy kind of ebbs and flows and certain types of properties are a little bit more stable and slower growing. Properties that have a high percentage of power center tenants, junior anchor boxes tend to be very, very stable unless there's a period of time where there's tenants did bankrupt and we're in one of those periods of time. So I don't think this is a surprise to us. I think we came here fully knowing at what point in the retailer cycle we're in but we all believe that DDR owns a pretty amazing portfolio of inexpensive space in the last mile situation and convenience is winning. So we're losing tenants but the leasing team are bringing new tenants to fill them up. So I would personally see it as kind of a short term issue where you're cycling through existing bankruptcy, the cost of companies and CapEx because there is a lot of work on the leasing side but we're left with new tenants and properties that are sitting in great trade areas. The only thing would change that is if this cycle of bankruptcies continues such that you never really get back to stabilization but at this point with the quality level of the real estate we have, I don't see that as a big risk.
Operator: The next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: Maybe I will start with you Matt, just thinking about the leverage target of about six times net debt-to-EBITDA. I’m just curious why you determined that level versus say something more in the mid-five or approaching more squarely in the middle around the range for BBB?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes I mean look I think that we will adopt the sense that if we can continue to de-lever without causing enormous pain to shareholders we’ll do that right but I think and to call this an exact science I think is difficult, I think we were looking at two different things right one is the willing, our willingness to inflict pain on the equity holders right and how much does de-levering does cost them, so there is a limit to how much we want to inflict. There is also a limit to how long we want to do this right. So we continue to dilute and dilute and dilute, year after year after year, so we viewed ourselves as having to some degree a time limit on this right and so what you can get done on that time limit also becomes a bit of a natural outcome and that kind of helps you drive towards where we ended up. The final thing I will say is and I as much as anybody I believe debt-to-EBITDA is a very important number but I think people should be equally focused on the structure of the balance sheet right and in particular what people maturity profile looks like, six times debt-to-EBITDA with nothing rolling in three or four years debt wise, it’s very different in fixed assets to EBITDA with everything rolling in three years right and so what I feel very good about is while we can all agree hey we would like to de-lever five times or four times sure, our willingness to inflict that pain is limited and frankly if we can get the effective leverage down by having a very long runway of very low maturities that's almost getting to the same place.
Jeff Donnelly: Thank you for that. And just now the review and plan are complete the end, you maybe have a firmer sense of the major factors that are affecting your future outlook, do you guys expect to return to providing FFO per share guidance and maybe as you move into the back half of 2017?
Matthew Ostrower: On the margin, I think so Jeff we haven't made a final decision about that.
Jeff Donnelly: And just one for David, can you talk more specifically about pricing that you're seeing in the market maybe how you see A versus B assets in A versus B markets and where you feel that remaining $700 million of asset sales falls in that grid?
David Lukes: Well starting with the latter, it's a little difficult to add and I know that it sounds evasive but it’s little difficult because the property typology that we’re putting on the market is not consistent. In other words, we're a little agnostic as to the retail format when we put properties into these three buckets what we're looking for is growth and we believe that we can roll up our sleeves and create NAV and so just by default it means that that bucket has a lot of different properties. We're going to be selling some single tenant net lease assets, we're going to be selling some grocery anchored properties, we are going to be selling some power centers and it's now a lot different than what we sold in the last quarter which was a mixture of those three. So I think on a cap rate basis, it's hard to tell you on a quarter-by-quarter basis what the whole bucket is going to look like. Personally, I think that our acquisitions team and the amount of insight we have into the market is a little bit surprising and that it's pretty strong that the CMBS world is still pretty supportive, I think at reasonable levels, I think they're looking through to the cash flows and seeing properties that are somewhat secure. And the number of bidders on everything to-date that we have really put into the market has been enough to make you feel confident we can keep going.
Jeff Donnelly: Maybe asking everyone I mean how do you think about the spread between sort of that A assets and A market sources I just call it B assets and B markets. I think there's been concern that some of the weakness that we've seen in the mall business for example on asset pricing is still going over into the power side of business I'm just curious if you think that there's truth to that or if you think that's maybe a little overblown I mean, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the pricing you've observed.
David Lukes: Well, we haven't we haven't seen and I know there's been a lot of dialogue but there's been a lot of dialogue in the last couple of months on everything retail. But in terms of the pricing the willingness of the buyers and the lenders we've still seen enough resilience that the pricing I don’t think is really moved a whole lot.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Thanks for the clarity about the trough and same-store NOI in 2H. And I apologize If you already went into detail on this but I was hoping you could give some discussion around your domestic portfolio versus your portfolio -- your Puerto Rican portfolio and maybe what's driving that deceleration and then how we should think about your JV. portfolio what seemed to decelerate the most across your Puerto Rican and then your domestic portfolio.
David Lukes: I give you only incremental color I would give, we've got I mean it's really hard again that this whole business of precision over a six month time period is difficult right. One of this transparent we can be but it's hard to pin down the exact numbers because things do move around. As one example we've got a Sears that's going to go bankrupt in the domestic portfolio in the third quarter not bankrupt sorry, it’s going to close in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter we've got a Wal-Mart in Puerto Rico that's going to go dark right. So based on that and some just trying to kind of read the TI lease a little bit different all given numbers we have I would say the U.S. probably a little more troughing third quarter if I had to guess and Puerto Rico troughing more in the fourth quarter growth rate wise. But it's again there's some false position there unfortunately.
Richard Hill: Yes. And so no specific trends to say look ones decelerating more than another.
David Lukes: No.
Richard Hill: Okay that's helpful.
David Lukes: I don't think so.
Richard Hill: All right so, you mentioned some comments about the CMBS market and I think maybe you finance something recently did you see any sort of difference in demand based upon differences in the quality of the portfolio that you were capitalized.
Conor Fennerty: Richard it's Conor. Yes I think the difference in demand was function of fixture floating and term as opposed to the quality for portfolio that we saw as biggest variable we saw.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: I just have a quick numbers question. I guess and talking about the second quarter results you mentioned here some non-recurring items in there. I think also Matt you mentioned that $1 million of base rent is not recurring talked about something co-tenancy resolution so if we're just thinking about the Q2 NOI starting point how much do we need to strip out on a go-forward basis to capture all of that.
Matthew Ostrower: Well what we said was there's a $1 million of now bankrupt tenants that we got so, we got some million dollars of base rent from bankrupt tenants in the second quarter that's going to disappear in the third quarter. There are some puts and takes Mike going forward and it's unfortunately is kind of a long list of small items so, I think it's really hard to summarize that. I would say you take that million and you can add a bit to it. I don't think it's a massive amount that you've got to add to it so I don't -- I don't have kind of buckets for you.
Michael Mueller: So it sounds like it’s not material anymore.
Conor Fennerty: We break that out in supplemental. You’ll see it we were back to historical levels starting in the third quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony How of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin: Thanks. Good morning it’s Ki Bin. Just one last question on Puerto Rico what were some of the reasons why those two assets were more sellable quickly versus the rest of portfolio?
David Lukes: Good morning Ki Bin. I don't think we said that they were more sellable at all I think that we looked at them and decided that those were two assets that were outliers in our portfolio for location and anchor type reasons. And a relationship with Ben Snyder in our office here resulted in the buyer that found some value in those properties at a reasonable price.
Ki Bin: Okay and like you mentioned if I look at the average base rent for those assets so it’s fairly a little bit lower than the average rate for in Puerto Rico and so 150 bucks a square foot or so, is there anything that we can any conclusions we draw from that for the remaining assets that are some on a much higher base rent and how we compare that to the 8% cap rate or is there just too many variables.
David Lukes: Well that the ADR variable which normally I would say is an interesting indicator since this one had a pretty low rent Kmart, way out on the west side of the island it's a little bit difficult to use that as an indication. If you wanted to pick one fact to, to put a ring fence around and understand transactions and why something got done is probably the size of the deal, two properties less than 60 million financeable private buyers, intelligent buyers that understand how to operate and have a long history so, those ingredients are important in terms of assets sales and you're probably seeing that through most of our asset sales, we don't really have items that are $100 million plus transactions happening right now in much of the country.
Ki Bin: And that capital was fairly economic right I mean those assets were full.
David Lukes: Yes.
Ki Bin: Okay. End of that quick one the notes receivable and your balance sheet went down anything to note there?
Matthew Ostrower: There was one -- the North Ridge that’s one of the transactions listed out on the page as the mezzanine loan payout in the second quarter.
Operator: The next question comes from Carol Kemple of Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
Carol Kemple: Good morning. This is just a question regarding modeling you all talked about a make whole provision from the bonds I think you said it was going to be $7 million next quarter will that be included in NAREIT FFO but excluded from operating FFO.
David Lukes: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Gooladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Gooladay: Hey, good morning everyone and your negotiations with tenants where you're getting the most pushback is it the initial rent, is that the contractual bonds the TIs just any color on that.
Matthew Ostrower: All the above. Just generally we get pushback on everything but as far as the trend off late and where we're seeing the sensitivity on the tenants, I think it tends to be a balance between the overall rents in the CapEx and making that work for us and work for them.
David Lukes: That’s not a new phenomenon.
Matthew Ostrower: There's not new about it but honestly tenants are top particularly the national chains and the Mom & Pops generally are left off.
Wes Gooladay: Okay. So you probably have I guess and we have heard something, some other landlords private landlords that the contractual bumps might have been under a little bit of pressure but not drastic like, some people are thinking but doesn't sound like that's the case.
Matthew Ostrower: That is not the case.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey good morning everyone. Just a couple of quick questions. David on your a portfolio review and as you were lining up the buckets what was the timeframe that you were sort of underwriting as you thought about were the opportunities were in terms of durable growth and redev.
David Lukes: Well that the timeframe of our modeling is 10 years. I would say that if you're looking at the durability that should be somewhat consistent across the term of the 10 years because that's more the definition of slow growth and durable. The second bucket the growth vehicle it's usually because there is some occupancy upside or there's some near-term idea that allows for growth and the redevelopment bucket is usually a little bit in the out years because it involves some negotiations with city governments with tenants on consent letters and so part of that feeds into a long-term business plan where you have kind of near-term, mid-term and long-term growth ideas.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great and then for the impairment for the quarter that was taken, can you give some color on that asset.
David Lukes: It was a variety of assets Chris. It wasn't just one asset, Chris I’m sorry once, there was a land parcels well right. Christa that you want.
Christa Vesy: Sure. This is shopping center which under the accounting rules to for the most part that's a good trigger, that is triggered anytime there's some sort of a change in what you're whole period is so that's just an asset that we're now looking equity in our disposition bucket. And then there was and then also two undeveloped parcels of land which again just some change in assumptions with how the team is looking at what those parcels are what we're going to do there.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then David you mentioned that on the Puerto Rico transactions that financing was involved. Just any color you can provide in terms of what the general terms were leverage wise or anything like that as it relates to the financing terms anything?
David Lukes: Definitely not.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then just last question on the -- you mentioned that you’ve got – you still see it better sort of give you guidance about it, are you seeing any divert of dispersion widening as it relates to the bids you’re seeing or is it still sort of inconsistent in terms of where bidders are coming in as a group?
David Lukes: Domestically or in Puerto Rico, Chris?
Chris Lucas: I think domestic, it doesn’t matter, just a broader question.
David Lukes: Do you mean if they were three bidders, are they widening out from each other is that what you mean or you mean?
Chris Lucas: So if you had sort of the normal bidding process had been say you’re getting three to five bids and there was a core less the rent -- there's generally core less with one outlier that’s the winner or is that dispersion getting is that or change the dispersion or how the bidding is are you getting more low bids, just give me a sense as just sort of how consistent is the bidding been?
David Lukes: Yes I guess in the last 90 days, I don’t think that we’ve seen it differently than it has been for 10 years meaning when there are assets that are highly understandable i.e. single tenant one lease, 10-years long fixed rent, the bidding pool tends to be closer together and when there are assets that involve assumptions on renewals and options triggers then the buyers tend to have some aggressive assumptions and some conservative and so they tend to widen now. I think that consistent with last 90 days and I don’t really see that changing, I think what would be to me more of an indicator of the market is if the people that come into the tent to actually make bids on an asset starts to decrease and so far in the secondary market it’s been somewhat consistently small.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes, President and Chief Executive Officer for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for your time and we look forward to next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon, and welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to start the call by expressing our thoughts and gratitude to our team in Puerto Rico during this difficult time. Many are struggling with the challenging day-to-day circumstances and damage to their homes and belongings. Despite this adversity, our team has accomplished enormous amount in very little time and I'm incredibly grateful to them. We've got quite a bit of content to review with you this morning. First I'll recap our 3Q results, including a review of our transaction activity. Then I will provide an overview of the current state of our assets in Puerto Rico. I'll then hand it over to Mike for more detailed commentary on the operating side. And finally, Matt, who will comment on our financial statements including updated guidance and will close with some comments on our balance sheet progress. To summarize the quarter operating FFO of $0.30 per share was in line with our internal expectations and includes an $8.2 million benefit from the expiration of Sears ground lease at Riverdale Village. The year-over-year decline in operating FFO per share was a product primarily of delusion from de-leveraging and to a lesser extent a decline in NOI from Puerto Rico. While FFO was within our budget, Continental U.S. operating results were better than we originally expected. Specifically same-store NOI for the Continental U.S. portfolio performed ahead of our budget of negative 0.7%, largely because of lower bad debt expense and the impact of real estate tax incentives. The better than expected NOI growth results in an increase in our Continental U.S. guidance which Matt will speak to later. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, our performance in Puerto Rico was in line with our expectations. Our percentage lease rate of 93.4% represents a sequential 40 basis point decline from 2Q was ahead of our prior guidance of 93.2%. Both this metric and occupancy which was roughly flat compared to last quarter benefited from ongoing leasing progress. I'd like to put our current leasing efforts in context with the results of the portfolio review we concluded and discussed on our second quarter call. As a reminder, we had categorized 66% of our NOI coming from properties that we viewed as durable. Much of our leasing completed during the third quarter was within this group of assets. We continue to make steady progress on maintaining the dominance of these assets by replacing vacated tenants at rents slightly above the prior tenants rent, and in most cases, introducing new retailer offerings to our trade area with footprint expansions from discount tenants with strong credit. The second group of properties we outlined last quarter were the ones where we see growth potential, which represents about 25% of our NOI. If these properties that our leasing team is spending considerable time working on and which we will be discussing in more detail over the next few quarters. When a dominant center gains an anchor vacancy it's a real chance for the landlord to make a compelling long-term change to the property, both financially, and with respect to tenant mix. The trigger for our opportunity is a vacant unit but the result is that we have available GLA that's fully entitled. It's important to note that our growth bucket of assets fit within trade areas with superior income demographics in most cases above $90,000 per household. What we found is that the range of vacancies are wide with respect to size between 20 and 40,000 square feet. But the tenant demand is also wide ranging from 10 to 30,000 square feet. In general, the smaller the tenant the higher the per square foot rent and therefore our economic opportunity relies on our ability to facilitate site plan changes that are beneficial to the current tenant demand. This is also why we initially gave our opinion that box vacancies in stable markets will average 12 to 18 months to backfill, a statement we still believe to be accurate. The first spaces to lease tend to be exact backfill, and the longer duration vacancies tend to be box reconfigurations. Our number one job is to match demand with entitled space and we've assembled a great team of development and leasing executives to capture that value. Long-term property help realizes on tenant mix and our national accounts team, headed by Bill Kern have been very active in the last two quarters helping those growing retailers find space in our best assets. Outside of operations, I'm pleased with the progress we've made continuing to sell properties. Specifically, we sold $392 million of assets this quarter, on top of $124 million in the first quarter, and $237 million in the second quarter. The weighted average cap rate for dispositions in the third quarter was once again sub-8%. We also sold an additional $190 million shortly after quarter end, which leaves us just under $400 million in proceeds as DDR share needed to reach our $900 million sales target we put out last quarter. Finally, Matt, will comment more later but dispositions and a variety of capital markets transactions have allowed us to quickly transform our balance sheet. With the closing of our new and expanded line of credit and term loans, we've substantially increased liquidity and completed the maturity extension process leaving us to focus on deleveraging as we continue to sell assets over the coming months. I'd like to now provide some commentary on our Puerto Rico operations and assets. Our priorities there have been first and foremost to account for our employees and to provide for their well being. Second, we've been working to ensure all properties were physically safe and water tight. Third, we work to remove debris and provide generator power, so that we can get stores and common areas open as soon as possible to ensure the people of Puerto Rico have access to basic living supplies. Finally, we've been working with our insurance company to assess damage, arrange for advances on business interruption insurance and begin to make permanent repairs to assets. So where do we stand today? We now have power either through the grid and/or through installations of generators at nine of our 12 assets including four enclosed malls and five outdoor centers. In addition, 24 of our 33 anchors are on grid or generator power and open for business. All this means that as of today, excluding Palma Real, 75% of our leased Puerto Rico GLA is now operating and open for business. It's difficult to provide generator power to individual small stores, so opening of shop spaces at our open-air properties generally depends on the restoration of grid power. Other stores that will remain closed over a longer time period include those who have received water damage including some that are in our closed mall assets. We've completed an initial property damage and business interruption reimbursement estimate of $100 million to $125 million. Roughly one-third of these costs are attributable specifically to Palma Real, which we expect to be repaired and restored. This estimate excludes $30 million of estimated cost associated with repair and damages to anchor spaces that are separately insured by those tenants. It also doesn't take into account the potential changes in pricing due to supply and labor shortages. Finally, we have commenced the process of formally scoping the specific permanent repair work at all properties and to source the contractors and professionals necessary to restore these assets to pre-storm condition. We are focused on getting our properties reopened as quickly as possible and have the resources and the right employees and tenant partners on the island to do so. Our SVP of Property Operations, Joe Lopez, our SVP of Construction, Joe Chura, and our Lead Property Management Executive in Puerto Rico, Xavier Gonzalez, are ultimately responsible for these enormous undertakings. They are among the most diligent, thoughtful, and effective real estate professionals with whom I've ever worked and I thank them for their efforts. We will of course make every effort to provide you with additional information on our Puerto Rico business as we have it. And with that I will hand the call over to Mike Makinen to provide you some additional color on our operations and the leasing environment generally.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. Total same-store NOI growth including Puerto Rico was negative 0.9% in the third quarter fueled by modestly positive growth in the Continental U.S. and negative 6.5% growth in Puerto Rico, when adjusting for hurricane costs and including Hurricane related bad debts. As David mentioned, our lease rate was ahead of our expectation and our commenced rate was roughly flat sequentially primarily due to a combination of steady leasing and store openings partially offset by no move-outs. We're particularly pleased to have the country's first two homes and stores TJX's new home furnishings concept opened at Shoppers World in Framingham, Massachusetts, and in East Hanover, New Jersey. The sequential decline in lease rates was caused by the aforementioned Sears ground lease exploration. We expect our Continental U.S. lease rate to end year in the 93.25% to 93.75% range. This range assumes no significant bankruptcy related store closings ahead of year-end. As we have said for the last two quarters, the leasing environment continues to be characterized by steady demand for space. To that end, we continue to expect that it will be a 12 to 18 month process to achieve rent commencements for new tenants filling anchor spaces made vacant from recent bankruptcies. We now have 24 of the 28 former Sports Authority, hhgregg, and Golfsmith spaces released or in LOI negotiations. Third quarter new leasing volume was 259,000 square feet. We feel good about our activity levels given we have nearly 536,000 square feet of new leases under LOI or in process as of the end of the quarter. Importantly, our small shop leasing focus has continued to generate an increase in activity for this portion of our portfolio. Blended new and renewal leasing spreads of 6.2% were consistent with year-to-date trends, while net effect of rents improved significantly to $15.50 this quarter from $9.50 in the second quarter, primarily a result of better economics from greater small shop leasing and overall renewal activity this quarter. This metric has historically been volatile and is generally affected by CapEx required by anchor leases offset by less capital intensive, higher rent, and land volumes. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Ostrower who will review our financial and refresh our 2017 guidance.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks Mike. I'd like to start by reviewing the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on our 3Q financial statements. First, we recorded $6.1 million of hurricane casualty and impairment costs on the income statement. Approximately $1 million of this relates to Hurricane Irma primarily debris removal which is within our deductible and thus will not be reimbursed by insurance. The second component of this line item is a $5 million capital costs related to deductible for property and casualty damages from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. This $5 million capital cost is a difference between a $65 million write-off of historical cost basis of property damaged by Hurricane Maria and a $60 million receivable on the balance sheet representing the portion of the book value of damages for which we expect to be reimbursed. As David mentioned, our actual estimates for the cost of repair and damages is likely to be higher than the write-off of historical book value this quarter. Second, loss revenues from Hurricanes Irma and Maria during the third quarter were roughly $2.6 million, approximately $1 million of which is attributable to our deductible on Puerto Rico insurance policies and will not be reimbursed. Separately we recorded an increase in bad debt reserves of $900,000 attributable exclusively to anticipated greater tenant financial difficulties in Puerto Rico. Both the $2.6 million of loss revenues and the $900,000 of Puerto Rico bad debt reserves were excluded from our calculation of same-store net operating income. Third, the company received a business interruption advance payment of $2 million related to third quarter loss revenues shortly after the close of the quarter. Given the timing we were unable to record this revenue on the income statement but expect to do so in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we are working to ensure regular payment of business interruption advances and would hope to record those on the income statement limiting the short-term impact of storm damage to net income and FFO. We carry property, casualty, and business interruption insurance with limits of $330 million including a $6 million deductible. Business interruption insurance generally covers the time it takes to make tenant space habitable plus one year. Our insurance policies carry traditional terms and contingencies that could affect actual insurance reimbursements. Switching gears to the balance sheet, we made significant progress this quarter and over the last six months extending maturities and improving liquidity. With the placement of a $350 million seven-year bond offering as well as the recapping and expansion of our line of credit and term loans, we believe this portion of our balance sheet restructuring is now complete. Our weighted average maturity of 8.3 years when including perpetual preferred securities now ranks as one of the longest in the shopping center REIT Group. We have almost $1 billion of liquidity with full availability under our recap line of credit after accounting for October asset sales as well as a well laddered maturity schedule. Just two quarters ago before we undertook these capital markets transactions, we faced a significant wall of maturities with $1.1 billion of debt or almost 25% of the total maturing in 2017 and 2018 and an additional $1 billion maturing in 2020. Going forward, we will focus primarily on deleveraging. Successful completion of the previously announced $900 million disposition program would result in several additional improvements including a better comprehensive leverage profile, additional extension of our weighted average maturities, and no unsecured maturities until 2021. We repaid our remaining 2018 secured maturities yesterday further increasing and improving the size and quality of our unencumbered asset pool. Finally, we have reduced the reserve for our preferred investment in the Blackstone joint ventures that we reported in the first quarter. This $15.4 million reduction is a product of higher than expected sales prices on several larger assets that closed or are under contract in the third quarter. As we discussed in the first quarter, GAAP accounting rules require us to adjust the security to market on a quarterly basis which means the reserve could increase again if future sales prices fall below expectations. One other Blackstone related item, we reached the sales threshold in our Blackstone III joint venture in the third quarter. As a result, we believe that 52% of all further sales proceeds will now be used to repay our preferred interest in that venture. Subsequent to quarter end, we received a $48.6 million repayment related to the sale of power processing and Whittwood Town Center with total year-to-date preferred repayments now up to $55 million. As we stated last quarter, we view disposition proceeds and Blackstone preferred proceeds as interchangeable in pursuit of our $900 million sales target. I'd like to now turn to some changes to our 2017 guidance. First, we had increased our same-store NOI guidance for the U.S. portfolio to negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% from negative 1% to positive 0.5% previously. This implies that U.S. same-store NOI should now trough in 4Q down modestly from the mid-point of the guidance range. The better guidance is a result of the above budget performance of the U.S. portfolio over the last six months. As Mike mentioned, our expectation for year-end Continental U.S. lease rates remains unchanged. Second, we are withdrawing 2017 guidance for same-store NOI performance in Puerto Rico. As David mentioned, roughly 75% of our lease GLA outside of Palma Real is now open for business including all major anchor spaces. This represents significant progress in a short time period and we're optimistic about continuing to reopen centers and stores over the coming weeks. The pace of this progress will depend in part on restoration of grid power to certain centers which is difficult to predict. In addition, selective spaces in all centers and the vast majority of space in Palma Real will not reopen for some time because of necessary repairs. We expect loss revenues attributable to the hurricane will be covered under our business interruption insurance policies, but the timing of these payments often occurs with a lag which impacts comparability. So to summarize, we believe we will make progress reopening stores in the fourth quarter but we still expect to face a significant revenue decline in the quarter. We hope to offset some of this decline with business interruption insurance advances but some of these payments may ultimately be received and recorded in a later quarter. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to David for a couple of closing comments. David?
David Lukes: Thanks Matt. My takeaway this quarter is steady progress. We have a significantly better balance sheet than we did even a few months ago. Our box leasing continued to be effective, our renewed focus on shop leasing is starting to produce results, and our knowledge of the portfolio we own is deepening. We use the annual budget process to evaluate risk and opportunity which is proving to be accurate and helpful as we focus our efforts. Even in the phase of a hurricane, our culture reacted quickly to focus on immediate solutions. We know where we need to create value for shareholders and our stewardship of this portfolio is going to produce results. And with that, I would like to hand the call back to the operator, so we can take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Good morning everyone. Just following up on the leasing that you've been doing, it sounds like there is more juice in there given what you have under LOI that's not reflected in the lease rates. You talked about this 12 to 18 months time period in terms of commencements, that’s a pretty big window maybe you can give us a sense for sort of along that timeline, how we should be thinking about lease commencements, I know you talked a lot about sort of reconfiguration of space but maybe just so we can kind of wrap our arms around the downtime that we're talking about?
Michael Makinen: Hey Christy, this is Mike. I think the best way to answer that is going back to the 12 to 18 months window that we've identified. We still feel pretty strong that is the appropriate window for backfilling some of the vacant spaces that came to us via the recent tenant bankruptcies. But generally the way the way that it's working is that in the early phase of getting those back, there's some pretty quick lease-up because you're generally getting tenants who are interested in that precise space and so there's an easy conformance with what their prototype is and what the space that's available happens to be. As time goes on, the thing that ends up taking the majority of the time is working through the configuration of spaces when a tenant needs 25,000 feet and we have 35,000 feet and so what ends up happening is we end up talking to multiple tenants and we have to conform and reconfigure the spaces to make it work. That takes quite a bit of time upfront which is really why things end up going out to as long as an 18 month window but we feel pretty confident right now that we're in a great progression as far as filling spaces and as far as our overall junior box leasing with -- at this moment we have 100% share over 600,000 square feet of leases in progress. So we feel we're making good progress and we also feel that we're pretty much in sync with our expectations and our historical norms in that deal flow.
David Lukes: Hey Christy, just one point of clarification the 12 to 18 months is after we get Sears back right post bankruptcy or post departure. So it's not meant to be a statement from today.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then just Mike maybe some insights into what you know about timing in terms of decision making around Tresoros stock closing. And then how are you thinking about your exposure just given all the changes in the movie theater industry right now, how are you thinking about your exposure there?
Michael Makinen: I'll start with Tresoros and right now we're in conversations with Tresoros. They are certainly in general looking at and working with us favorably in some cases, less favorably in others, but right now that's a work-in-progress and we'll have more to report on that most likely next quarter. As far as movie industry, we've got pretty good relationships with AMC and Regal and in general we're finding that in our centers we happen to have pretty good locations and we feel pretty confident that we're in pretty good shape with regard to the movie industry and the leases in our centers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi thanks. Good morning. So in terms of the disposition cap rates in the quarter which you characterized a sub-8% and also the better than expected pricing on the Blackstone asset sales. Can you just provide a little bit more color on those comments on what you're saying in general and maybe just talk about how demand and pricing for the assets that you're in the market with now is?
David Lukes: Sure, good morning Todd. I wish that the data pool was big enough to be able to tell you something that was a credible number but the reason we kind of say sub-8% is simply because the cap rate on assets we're selling range from the five to the nine, so it really depends on which assets close during that quarter. I would say that for the most part the buyer pool has been fairly steady. Their access to mortgage debt has been fairly steady and the closing process has been consistent with prior years. So we haven't really seen a great change in the transaction markets that's worthy of noting.
Michael Makinen: And on the Blackstone pieces to comment, I think we have only partial visibility on that process, right, we're not running that whole process. So in a certain sense we had to put an estimate out there at the end of the first quarter and the sales process had just really begun then. So we had limited visibility and the process was early, we obviously are able to fine tune things more as that process continues and as transactions actually happen. So it's less about some massive change in the market overall and more about our increasing visibility on actual values.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then just following up on the some of the anchor vacancies, thinking about those going forward to the extent that there are additional vacancies are you anticipating from here that the majority of the incremental boxes you might recapture would be reconfigured versus backfilled assets and how much is the average cost per square foot generally when you have to reconfigure a box?
David Lukes: For the conference we'll put an easy one because it's all over the map. I mean it really depends on a tenant work layer, figuring out what their credit looks like, what kind of square footage they need, I would say that that's the most intense financial analytics we do is when we're splitting up a box because we're trying to figure out how much return we can get and how safe that capital investment is.
Michael Makinen: As far as the proportion it's a breakout of how many will be split, it really depends on what we get back that's the same answer, every space is different, every tenants prototype is different, so it's really to be determined.
David Lukes: I'll also add that it's not out of the norm in this sector that spaces were purpose built for a prototype and 10 years later prototypes have changed and that's why the cost to build a one-storey open-air strip center box is relatively small relative to other asset classes and so configurations there are a normal part of the process you saw with Mervyns, you’ve seen it with KMart, it’s a normal part of process and so I don't think it's something we find it surprising.
Matthew Ostrower: I will just highlight, it's Matt. I'll just highlight that we’re very thoughtful about the economics here right credit is extremely important for spending money it's got to be somebody who we think is going to be there not just for the initial lease term but through several renewals thereafter, so we can actually make money. We're not just shelving people with posters into boxes particularly on these more CapEx intensive areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking my call. I want to just chat a little bit about the transaction market in light of your $900 million disposition plan that you've previously announced, it looks like you made some good progress and you made some comments earlier about maybe higher than expected sales prices, so what are you seeing in the U.S. market at this point, house demand for buying properties cap rates stable, they’re tightening, they’re widening, what are you thinking about given that you’re pretty active at this point?
David Lukes: Richard it’s hard to be kind of the spokesperson for what the entire transaction market looks like. I think from our own company's perspective over the last five years DDR has disposed of a substantial amount of assets and so you certainly could make the argument that what we're disposing of now is primarily for the purpose of deleveraging and not because of an outsized risk on the asset which just means that there are other buyers that are finding value, and I think the cap rates that we're getting are very fair. If I had to kind of pull back and characterize it, I would say that there are certain buyers that understand this property type, they’re able to get mortgage debt and they can receive very good returns in kind of property types and submarkets that maybe less desirable from certain institutions. And so the buyer pool tends to be a little bit more, a little bit more private I would say and a little bit less institutional.
Rich Hill: Got it. And so I'm sorry if I missed this, did you disclose cap rates on the call it $300 million plus that you sold in the quarter?
Matthew Ostrower: We simply said in the script we said there is sub-8% kind of our normal process.
Rich Hill: Okay, great. And then just one quick question on the occupancy guidance obviously it increased, is it comparable to the 93% to 93.5% previously I was looking at prior press release and this press release says the U.S. portfolio but the prior press release was bit silent on that, so I'm just curious is that comparable? Or is there some impact relative to Puerto Rico?
David Lukes: You're asking the right question Rich. Just to be totally clear, it's not comparable, we would say we never kind of gave the U.S. occupancy number before. So given the comments I made about Puerto Rico, I think it's very difficult to know where occupancy is going to end up there. So we’re taking that off the table, we're giving you a new number for the U.S. I would tell you based on our internal numbers previously that that occupancy number is unchanged.
Rich Hill: Got it, okay. Thank you very much. I will jump in and follow-up separately with any more questions.
Matthew Ostrower: Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Schmidt: Thanks. I'm wondering what should we think about the loss revenue for Puerto Rico in fourth quarter.
Matthew Ostrower: I'm sorry what do we think about it?
Craig Schmidt: No, no. What should we be think -- we as analyst turn to budget for the year, what do we think we might lose relative to the number you gave on 3Q?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, I think that's -- there's obviously a problem there right; we're in a situation where I think it's very, very difficult to predict. I think we try to be as transparent as we can about our expectations for our operations and we found ourselves in a position where we just find it extremely difficult to make a forecast there, it's only 12 assets, right it's obviously a significant part of our revenue base but it's only 12 assets. It really will depend Craig on things like those grid power come back on. It's -- so I think we don't really I would tell you we ourselves don't exactly really know that number yet otherwise we would have given you some kind of an estimate. I'm sorry to not be able to clear you about it.
Craig Schmidt: Okay. And then just thinking about your tenant watch list with real focus on big-box and junior anchors relative to year ago, do you think things are the same, better or worse in terms of potential closings in 2018.
Matthew Ostrower: Well, yes, so I guess the watch list is a different question than exactly what's going to happen in 2018. We use our watch list obviously to decide on to whom do we want to extend credit, to whom do we want to extend capital on which requires a much longer view than just 2018. What I can comment on is that our watch list is relatively unchanged there's been some ins and outs obviously you see some things come down as a result of the bankruptcies that were declared throughout 2017 and then we've obviously put some more on given some of the news that's come out in our analysis of financial statements for some of the larger companies but the actual exposure number has not changed dramatically in the last 9 to 12 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Good morning. Two questions. First maybe a different way of Craig's question down in Puerto Rico what percent of tenants are currently paying, so you obviously Simon gave what their view is from their assets, Kimco gave their view from what they're booking, can you guys just tell us currently what percent of your tenants are paying rent?
David Lukes: Well we really haven't had long enough to know the answer of that question, Alex. We have -- if you think about the time horizon here things happened relatively close to the end of the quarter. We really will know a lot more in another five or six days right which is unfortunate timing as it relates to our providing guidance on this call. What we said was that 75% of the leased GLA is now open for business ex-Palma Real. We would certainly expect those tenants to pay -- to pay their rents, but it's a fluid and uncertain environment, some tenants may not be able to pay their rent, others may say that they have the right to abate, there's just a lot of -- there's a lot of -- there's a lack of clarity on exactly what those cash flows are going to look like, it's another level of uncertainty that we have in predicting these cash flows. So we're telling you really everything that we know at this point in time which is who is open and where we've got power et cetera. The actual revenue prediction I think is quite difficult.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then but it's part of that the 75% those tenants are primarily U.S. national or super credit type tenants or is it a mix of or some of the stuff that's closed, is not just small shop but it's also some of the Nationals?
David Lukes: It’s a huge cross section right, I would say that you can’t really -- I wouldn't say there is any real bias to that number, we have -- we said 24 to 33 anchors are now open, obviously anchors tend to be certainly national or certainly higher credit. So you can take some comfort in that but then you can to get up to the 75% of GLA open it's a lot of small shop as well and we do have -- we have a bigger small shop exposure in Puerto Rico than we do in our U.S. portfolio. Alex, one thing I would tell you is just think about also the other moving part here, you're asking about revenues which is obviously a fair focus, the other piece of it is BI, right. So to the degree we don't get rent from some of these tenants, to the degree we can't get more of them open, to the degree power turns off or doesn't turn on in certain areas, we will be collecting BI on that. I think as some of our peers will have said to you it's just very difficult to know exactly when that BI will come in the door. I think we've done a good job arranging to get some of it earlier but that’s still a work-in-progress and we don't know exactly when the payments are going to happen and when we'll be able to record them on the income statement.
Alexander Goldfarb: Right but once you do get the BI that covers the whole portfolio whether or not the asset is open or closed? Correct.
David Lukes: Yes, it's going to be tenant by tenant, it's going to depend on the individual circumstances but if we are missing our view is that if we're missing revenues because of the hurricane that is a BI claim on our part.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is on the economic rents you said in the quarter they were bit better just because you did more small shop but as we think about you guys cutting up space and duplicate system services HVAC, fire safety, and all that stuff, do you anticipate that most of the rents will be economically positive or there will be a fair amount that end up being sort of neutral but just because of a cost incurred of combining space or dividing space in the redundant systems that even though you may get higher rent, it sort of nets out, what's your view on that?
Matthew Ostrower: There are very few situations where you're compelled to make a big investment for a negative value creation. It's just it's just not all that common.
David Lukes: One thing I would like to point out is that the process of cutting up boxes is as common as it gets in the shopping center space. It's an age old practice from the days when Montgomery Ward boxes were received by large landlords and it still continues through to today. So some of these deals are really great and really profitable and some of them are less. So we're always doing things because we think there's a good credit there or because and/or because if there is material increase in the merchandise mix in our center.
Matthew Ostrower: The other point I would make as it relates to shop leasing is that when we split up a Junior Box, it’s often with three smaller tenant there's still over 10,000 square feet, so the shop effort and the reconfiguration of anchors are not one and the same. Shop effort applies to all shop space across the portfolio which generally is a very positive financial return.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning guys and Matt thanks for trying to provide some clarity on those situation in Puerto Rico. Are you able to break down your -- I would call pre-storm revenues or NOI in Puerto Rico, I'm just curious if you might have a sense even a rough one how that would breakdown between anchors and then shop space both national and local if it's sort of fair to fair to fair there?
Matthew Ostrower: Meanwhile Jeff I can call you back and give you some more color on that, I don't have the exact number ticking about, I will call you back and give you a follow-up on that.
Jeff Donnelly: That’s good. And then just building on an earlier question I know there's a lot of this in here but assuming there's no big change in store closings, is it fair to say we could see a bottoming or an inflection in your reported lease rate as we move into early to mid 2018 and I guess maybe building off that as it relates to leasing spreads because the portfolio is maybe running with slightly higher vacancy, is it fair to say you should expect leasing spreads to continue to decelerate perhaps beyond inflection in your lease rate just as you begin to rebuild occupancy in the portfolio?
Michael Makinen: I think lease rates tend to be one of the most volatile areas of all of the metrics that we have in the leasing realm. But I think in general, we've seen a fairly consistent run of our overall leasing spreads over the last several quarters and I don't really have a sense that that's going to go up or down, sometimes one major deal where you replace a low rent tenant can shift the entire picture, sometimes they can shift in the other direction. So I feel pretty strong that it's really going to be up in the area as far as where it goes. But I don’t see it going down.
Matthew Ostrower: I think just its Mike as a follow up, I think it’s an unequivocal yes that we believe our occupancy would rebound if bankruptcy stop, I don't think we see our occupancy or current vacancy rate as structural in any way, it's really going to depend on what happens to the bankruptcy picture which I think is not [indiscernible] at this point.
David Lukes: Jeff, one of the things that I could add on the spread discussion is that, it's important to look at which tenant went bankrupt because of the age of their lease and therefore the likely in place rents. So if you're talking about hhgregg which is a relatively near history lease for this company and for most the likelihood that rents inflated over a five or six year period is not, not very high and therefore you would expect the spread to be not nearly as great because of a built in mark-to-market. At toys or babies, it’s a little different because they're lethal tend to be little bit older, so you can have situations where the rents have a large mark-to-market spread, so a lot of the volatility Mike talking about has less to do with the supply and demand today is much is simply the rent related to the loss rent.
Jeff Donnelly: Understood. And actually maybe somewhat related to that, I mean how you guys think about your 2018 expirations, I guess maybe a two-part question, have you seen any change in the percentage of your tenants that are exercising options would normally be doing at this point and I guess how do you think about the rents on expirations and how they compare to where you've been signing deals, is it sort of provide an easier hurdle for you thinking it’s kind of the same as we've seen in past years, how do you think about it?
David Lukes: There’s no question that there's a lot of dialogue about new leasing because that seems to be something that's easy to look at. But you're right and that the real barometer of how property is doing performance wise is do the tenants trigger their options. And I must say one of the benefits of having larger box expirations is that unlike a shop tenant where you're negotiating every single time, we're simply banking on a percentage of renewal probability and as much as we're keeping an eye on it, so far the probability of renewals has not really changed dramatically. Just continue to be decent, the sales growth I think is not all that high for a lot of tenants but their ability to pay the same rent they've been paying for the last five years seems to be the same.
Michael Makinen: Yes, I think I mean the previous comment of putting their, Jeff, in terms of you look this quarter we saw a nice uptick in renewal activities certainly by the last few quarters at very consistent spreads. So where we sit today it looks fine, would we like a higher spread yes but the spreads are pretty consistent. Where we go in the future I think there's still some uncertainty about that but so far so good.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey it's Michael Bilerman here for Christy. I'm just curious on Puerto Rico, does this whole thing affect your ability if you wanted to sell an asset try to hive off the portfolio and I'm just thinking about how transfer whether there's any transferability of your insurance at all to potential other buyer or effectively now we should expect these assets to be on your balance sheet for the foreseeable future?
Michael Makinen: I'll just take the insurance question; it’s our view that transferability of insurance isn’t an issue. David you want to add?
David Lukes: Having said that, I think Michael the reality is you know right now it would be a Brexit to say that they’re active buyers of properties in Puerto Rico since we're still trying to grid power on and tenants open for business, so it's just a little bit too early to tell. I do understand your question very well which is before we said we're open to lots of different types of transactions on Puerto Rico, we executed a couple of them at great prices a few months back. But I would say right now the idea that we would be actively engaged in conversations about transactions is probably very low.
Michael Bilerman: Just think about some of the public market access that some companies have used to hive-off or rings tence more difficult portions of their portfolio arguably this is acting somewhat of a drag in starting the entire company, so I didn't know if that was potentially on the table in terms of some public market split of the company to isolate Puerto Rico so that the rest of the company would be valued and look at more cleanly?
David Lukes: Good question. I think what we've said even in the last few quarters is that this management team is willing to consider anything that would create or protect shareholder value. And there are a lot of types of ideas that could be considered but should always be considered at any quarter. So nothing is off the table and you can rest assure that we're certainly focused like a laser on making decisive actions when something seems credible.
Michael Bilerman: And then just lastly if was there anything or has there been anything precluding your majority shareholder auto from buying stock and I just say that's just in the vein of he was very active, last November buying almost a million shares and then through basically late April to early June buying another 2.4 million shares that's in stock probably $9 or $10 clearly the stock has unfortunately fallen below those levels, I just don’t know if there's been anything between May and today that would have precluded him and his family from accumulating additional shares that arguably what would be much lower prices from their focus his entire position to begin with?
David Lukes: It's a good question Michael, to be perfectly honest I don't know. I think this quarter I paid much more attention to the fact that all of our board members, our board members and I paid very little attention to their personal acquisitions of the stock, it's not a bad question I'm sure we can get back to you on it. But the reality is we're focused on trying to get our properties open and have been a little bit more concerned about operations than anything else.
Michael Bilerman: And I guess would you guys [indiscernible] done a great job at pushing and creating liquidity and also looked at their debt maturity schedule, would you ever entertain buying your own stock at this point at least having a program in place, so that if you can be opportunistic in selling I don't know half an interest of the core asset and generating a lot of proceeds using that to mass fund buying stock instead of deleveraging?
David Lukes: Okay. Well I certainly agree that the existing stock price certainly looks attractive. The reality is that I think our primary stewardship is around risk and right now, the easiest way to keep risk low at this company is through deleveraging and so our capital allocation right now is entirely towards the deleveraging process which of course if we engage in buying stock we would reverse that, at some point it becomes more interesting but I think at this point the primary focus is on our amount of debt.
Michael Bilerman: Well does the sale of Woodworth [ph] which was a pretty low cap rate in the low five entice you to say what we've got a lot of other wood type assets sitting on our portfolio that we wholly own maybe as much as those are long-term assets for us, maybe we should think about trying to tap the market and sell those today to increase liquidity to put you in a better position to be able to buy your stock that was trading at the standard levels.
David Lukes: I think what you're really getting at is speed and up to-date in the whopping eight months that we've been here I think the accomplishments on balance sheet have been pretty fast, we set out a goal as to exactly what we're going to do by when and I would say we're on track to achieve that goal by selling assets that we don't think have the high growth prospects that we think the company deserves to keep.
Matthew Ostrower: I would just reiterate I think you're asking the right question that this is a topic that we discussed a lot and we're very focused on trying to create value here right. So everything is absolutely on the table. While we think it's very important to finish our initial program which isn’t going to take that much longer and that much further in terms of capital, where we go from there is a very important question and we're trying to be incredibly kind of creative and decisive about adding some value here and not letting the stock languish.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Good morning guys. Hi along the same lines, what is your commitment level today towards your dividend especially in light of your depletion pipeline maybe a second round to that and obviously some disruption in Puerto Rico which next year might get worse, just combining all those things with our stocks trading at almost 10% yield isn’t possibly rightsizing the dividend a source of capital for all your needs?
Matthew Ostrower: Good morning, Ki Bin. Right now, I don’t really see the access to capital being an issue, we’re selling assets at very good prices, we're getting plenty of bidders and closings are happening without a whole lot of hit. So I think from where we find the capital, the dividend is much, much, much further down the list in terms of what we think is interesting. Our dividend is valuated every quarter by the board and at this point, I certainly don't see anything that would mean that the dividend became more interesting than selling assets.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And on Puerto Rico, could you help me better understand the longer-term risk and what percent of your tenants actually had their own insurance to help sustain their businesses longer-term and I guess what is the risk that after your business interruption insurance runs off, what kind of demand would there be and given how much or how little the tenants had their own insurance?
Matthew Ostrower: I think it's a really important series of questions that unfortunately the landlord has relatively little visibility into. The risks are fairly simple. We have I think if you've toured our properties there you'll recognize that the dominance of their locations is quite high. I mean I was very impressed with a large number of the properties that we had in Puerto Rico. They have great fundamentals, great locations, great anchors, and the primary risk we have right now is that business insurance lasts for a year and after that year you say to yourself how many of the tenants that were previously open for business and paying rent will be previously REIT will be open in the future and paying rent and we just don't know. So far the level of store openings has increased dramatically and I think yesterday we had maybe 20 or 30 emails coming through that were tenant opening up a business again, so the signs are all good but you're talking about a year from now and it has a lot to do I think with how the island responds from a power and infrastructure and population perspective and I just can't even guess.
Operator: Our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Boenning. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Great, thanks guys. Just following up on Michael's question, in terms of obviously the share price is telling you guys something and in terms of the pace of the restructuring clearly you guys have made it tremendous strides since you came on board but do you feel like you need to speed up some of that work and does that make you look more favorably upon a potential spend or something like that or you guys going to continue to execute your plan even if it takes another two years?
David Lukes: Well I don't have a whole lot more to add then I think the conversation responded to Michael but you’re right that you always want to step back and say are we moving fast enough. The reality is that the business plan was not another two years. We named a target as to when we would be at a leverage level that we were happy with. We named specifically the group of assets and the size that we would be selling and so far they've been selling and so far they've been selling faster and at lower cap rates than we originally thought. So I think all seems to be moving along, to me that’s a different question than what other types of things can a management team do and to that I'll say the things I said to Michael which is everything is on the table and we're certainly not unwilling to take decisive action when we see an idea that makes sense.
Floris van Dijkum: Okay, thanks. And the other question I guess is in terms of making your portfolio more attractive going forward maybe if you can touch upon with -- obviously with the rent spreads we talked about but also maybe talk about your initiatives on the fixed bumps on the portfolio and how are you making progress on that, increasing the fixed bumps?
Matthew Ostrower: You're talking about getting more fixed bumps into leases?
Floris van Dijkum: Yes, yes and getting higher fixed bumps into leases.
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, I don't think that we addressed that directly for something we’re saying, I mean obviously we try to do that where we can but I don't think that's something I would call cornerstone of our strategy at this point.
Michael Makinen: We're obviously trying to get as favorable lease terms as we can with every tenant we can and we're aggressive as we can be every, every single time and obviously having fixed bumps annual fixed bumps is what we strive for and most of the shop tenants have those, the anchors particularly the nationals generally have a five-year rent step and they generally don't budge from that.
Floris van Dijkum: Right. So you're not seeing a real change in that perhaps going forward or you have interest --?
David Lukes: We haven't seen a change to the negative or the positive. I mean it’s really there are certain situations where you're able to receive much higher rent bumps, it tends to be smaller tenants that are more local in general, I mean that's why the higher shop percentage properties tend to have high growth at times in the economy when there's good GDP growth. Our properties with larger anchors tend to be lot more protected on the downside because the fixed bumps have been generally respected by the tenants, when they exercise their options. So I don't really think there's been a great change on that. I think what will give confidence to investors in this space with our product type is quarter-after-quarter-after quarter delivery of incremental steps to the positive and we're more focused on that than something that's striking to come out in one quarter. We're making great progress on leasing, we have a lot of anchors that we have to choose through, we’re getting through a number of them in general they’re rents that economically better than the prior tenants. And so it may not be front page news but it's certainly step by step very positive.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas with CapitalOne. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey good morning guys. Just a couple of small questions. Mike earlier you talked about the toys conversations you had with them, I guess if you could maybe characterize those conversations as more focused on rent reduction on their end or on a change in their footprint, how would you characterize that?
Michael Makinen: I would say generally the conversations are very early and I think we should probably give you more updates as they become more material.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then I guess couple of accounting related issues on the you talked earlier about renewals, the renewal spreads that you guys post, do those include both of those that are at market and those that are fixed renewal rates?
Michael Makinen: I think so, yes.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then as it relates to --
David Lukes: It’s contractual and negotiated.
Chris Lucas: It's contractual and negotiated, yes?
Matthew Ostrower: Correct, yes.
Michael Makinen: That's into the blended forecast.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then as it relates to the reconfiguration costs, do all of the costs essentially end up in the reported GI numbers that are -- that you guys post or some of the cost allocated to base building and not included in those tenant-driven cost?
Michael Makinen: It's attributable to the lease it's in the TI numbers; we try to be pretty careful about that, Chris.
Chris Lucas: So it’s all in there, so all costs related to the reconfiguration?
Michael Makinen: I can’t say with 100% certainty that we’ve never taken anything out but it’s a vast, vast majority if we are fully loading that number.
Chris Lucas: Okay. That’s all I was looking for. And then lastly David you mentioned about focus on probability of renewals, I guess just kind of what has been the story of tenant retention rate that you guys have been running at?
David Lukes: You mean the historic last eight months or the historic for the company over the years?
Chris Lucas: Whichever you would like to give me.
David Lukes: It’s a good question, the portfolio of the company in last five years has changed so dramatically with dispositions. We should look back and calculate it what has been on the existing portfolio. I can say just in my career it's generally been in the mid-90s and so the whole industry was based on a pretty high likelihood of renewals usually higher for anchors and a little bit lower for shops and much as we’re concerned about it, we really haven't seen a notable change in that even in the last five, six, seven years.
Chris Lucas: Okay great, I appreciate it. Thanks.
David Lukes: That would certainly be an indicator that a tenant either a) can support their option rents or b) have other choices to move to where a landlord across the street is willing to put in a lot of capital to build a new store, it's always been part of the business but I don't think we've seen any dramatic change in the last year or two.
Chris Lucas: Excellent, thank you. Appreciate the time this morning.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Good morning guys. So just looking at your leasing spreads, I know it’s been pretty stable sort of in the mid-single-digits kind of area but I know it’s kind of decelerated probably for a lot of the folks in the shopping center peer group maybe from the high-single-digits whether it's 8%, 9%, 10%. So as we think about sort of 2018, I know you haven't provided guidance but just trying to figure as we formulate 2018 sort of numbers on same-store. Do you feel pretty confident that you can still kind of maintain that sort of 5% to 6% renewal spreads here?
Matthew Ostrower: It feels reasonable that we would be able to maintain that, yes.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all for joining and appreciate the questions. We will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
39,SITC,4,2017,2018-02-16 17:00:00,"Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to DDR Corp's. Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day-Anderson. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day-Anderson: Good evening and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, Matthew Ostrower. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may be forward-looking.

At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good evening and thank you very much for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings call. I’d like to start by summarizing the three key points I’d like everyone to take away from this call. First, 2018 is the year in which restructuring and dilution from deleveraging will start, replaced by growth and enhanced returns to stakeholders. Second, this shift is possible because of the dramatic changes we made to our balance sheet, which is now among the best in the shopping center space. And third, there are substantial leasing opportunities embedded in the new DDR portfolio, including mark to market of anchor spaces and significant momentum in small shop leasing. Now onto the quarter. I will review our results and then provide an update on the spin of RVI and recent DDR transaction activity. I will then hand the call over to Mike for comments on Puerto Rico and an in-depth look at the operating environment and we will close with some comments from Matt on the balance sheet and guidance. Operating FFO per share growth for 2017 in the fourth quarter were negative, largely because of dilution from the deleveraging process. We exceeded our 2017 transaction expectations handily, disposing of over $1.3 billion of assets and bringing pro rata debt to EBITDA down from over 7x at the beginning of the year to 6.4x today. This has been painful for shareholders, but we continue to believe derisking was the right decision given today's operational and capital markets uncertainties. Decisive actions in 2017 mean that dilution from deleveraging should end in 2018. Operationally, 2017 presented growth headwinds primarily from exposure to several large anchor tenant bankruptcies and the impact of hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. Despite these headwinds, results exceeded our original budget allowing us to avoid a contraction in Continental U.S NOI. Looking forward, we still expect at least 1.5% same-store NOI growth in 2018 for new DDR unchanged from December and a product of DDR significantly improved portfolio following the completion of our $900 million disposition program and the spin of slower growth assets in Puerto Rico. Mike will say more about Toys ""R"" Us shortly, but the announced closures in new DDR are great examples of embedded opportunities in our restructured portfolio. In fact, many of the assets in new DDR were selected precisely because of anticipated retailer disruption. Toys ""R"" Us closures at two of our best assets will open-up future redevelopment projects with potential value creation far exceeding lost NOI and downtime at other toys closures. We expect this story to recur at new DDR again and again where incremental closures represent net opportunity for stakeholders. Turning now to the spin of RVI. We remain on track for midyear 2018 effective date and we closed on the $1.35 billion mortgage just yesterday, a major milestone for the transaction. We expect to provide more details on the loan and it terms in the upcoming months when the loan syndication process is complete. And as we mentioned at the time of the announcement, we've already commenced the asset sales process with the majority of the Continental U.S assets now formerly listed for sale of brokers. We expect RVI transactions to begin closing in the second quarter with larger volumes in the second half of the year. Finally, I'd like to comment on our recent transaction activity. We sold nearly $600 million of assets in the fourth quarter at a blended 7.5% cap rate at our share and closed an additional $135 million subsequent to quarter end. For the full-year 2017, we sold over $1.3 billion of assets at a sub 8% cap rate. Asset level debt markets are open, private market buyers are active, and our sheer volume of recent activity gives us great confidence that we have clarity on current pricing. This last quarter alone we sold 13 assets to 12 different buyers. We have a dedicated and focused transaction team and I’m incredibly pleased with their results. Their better than expected pace allows DDR to pivot to leverage neutral, capital recycling in 2018, something that energizes our entire company. I’d like to reiterate how proud I’m of our team's accomplishments in 2017 and how excited I’m about new DDR's opportunities in 2018. Over the past 12 months, we streamlined our organization and significantly reduced costs. We fundamentally restructured our balance sheet through deleveraging and over $900 million of securities offerings. We supported our employees in Puerto Rico and began the recovery process, and of course we announced the final step in our strategic transformation through the spin of RVI, creating two different and focused business plans for two different portfolios. I spend the last month visiting new DDR assets, once again with our outstanding leasing and property management teams and then convinced that we have exciting opportunities embedded in our strong new DDR portfolio. We expect 2018 to be very different from 2017, especially as we return to a growth posture. But one thing will remain constant is our commitment to act decisively in order to create value for all stakeholders. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike to review some key operating conclusions.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. Fourth quarter same-store NOI growth for the Continental U.S portfolio was negative .4% in line with our budget. Better than expected occupancy would have resulted in flat NOI growth, if it were not for a 30 basis points negative impact from unbudgeted snow removal costs. Importantly and as part of the theme you will see with nearly all of our fourth quarter operating metrics, new DDR is roughly 1% same-store growth, was measurably stronger than the combined portfolio. The combined companies lease rate declined 20 basis points sequentially to 93.5%. This was entirely a product of dispositions as the assets we sold in Q4 had weighted average lease rate of 98.9%. Total NOI growth in our Puerto Rico assets was negative in the quarter, a product of the lingering hurricane impact in the island's weak economy. Electricity from state utility has been restored to all of our assets, and the repairs to damage spaces has begun. While year-over-year operating comparisons will remain challenging, I am encouraged by our significant positive sequential momentum highlighted by the opening of the first Dave & Buster's on the island mid-January, which has exceeded expectations. From a physical perspective, we reported at 75% of lease space was reopened at the end of October, excluding our badly damaged Palma real estate, and that number rose to 85% at the end of January. More importantly, 92% of the tenants opened at the end of January were rent paying as cash receipts have rebounded similarly. I couldn't be happier with the progress to date and the current state of the assets which upon visit are in excellent shape with full parking lot, heavy foot traffic, and great sales volume. To show you just how far things have come, we produced a short video tour of footage from two weeks ago, which is available in our earnings call slide deck as well as in the section of our Web site. I would encourage you to click on the link, you will be amazed at the progress. All of this would not be possible without the herculean efforts by our team on the islands as well as our property and construction management teams. On leasing economics our fourth quarter results were strong with ongoing healthy new lease volumes and better newly spreads been year-to-date trends. Importantly, when combining new and renewal leasing activity, new DDR spreads of 9.5% were measurably above the combined companies by .9%. We continue to make progress backfilling vacant anchor boxes from 2016 and 2017 bankruptcies. Backfilled tenants include Marshalls, AutoZone, planet business in Burlington. At our Westlake redevelopment project here in Cleveland, we now have signed leases with Fresh Thyme, Ultra, HomeSense, and perhaps supplies plus. I’ve spoken previously about my view that there was a small shop leasing opportunity at DDR. And we now have two quarters of improving results to back up this thesis. Specifically third quarter's small shop leasing volumes were up 30% compared to those in the first half of the year. And fourth quarter, volumes, were up 48% on the same basis, despite a smaller number of assets we are releasing. And we didn’t achieved these volumes, but sacrificing economics. As the average double-digit spreads we achieved on these spaces in the second half of the year attest. We see these new, higher, profitable activity levels at sustainable, given the 590,000 square feet of small shop space that is currently vacant in the higher quality new DDR portfolio. On Toys ""R"" U.S, the bankruptcy will impact our portfolio in 2018. I will walk through the results of our negotiations thus far. Though I would add that final closures and outcomes remain subject to change as the bankruptcy process continues. As of now we expect eight stores to close and the combined portfolio with portfolio on stores in new DDR, including a previously announced retenanting of a dark but rent paying store in Los Angeles. The impact of 2018 NOI is expected to be $4.3 million for the combined company and $3.5 million for new DDR, a 73 basis point impact to same-store NOI. We do not expect any of these closures to trigger co-tenancy clauses. This bankruptcy scenario is an important case study for new DDR with an estimated mark to market in new DDR significantly higher than that in the combined portfolio. I will close with some comments on the operating environment, which I’ve described as generally unchanged from quarter ago. We continue to see healthy demand for spaces, including our vacant anchors. Though the breadth of demand is certainly smaller than it was several years ago. With that, I will hand the call over to Matt for some comments on our balance sheet and guidance.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks, Mike. As David mentioned, the work we've done this year both in terms of lowering leverage through asset sales as well as significantly extending our maturities, means that DDR is positioned to begin investing capital and growing FFO in 2018. Pro rata debt to EBITDA declined from roughly 7x at year-end 2016 to 6.4x today. Additionally, repayment of debt when combined with the three debt and preferred offerings completed this year, resulted in a significant lengthening of the combined companies weighted average maturity from 4.2 years at the beginning of the year to 5.4 as of yearend. New DDR will benefit from all these changes with added derisking through improvement in the overall quality of the unencumbered pool and extension of our weighted average maturity to 6.5 years through the application of proceeds from the $1.35 billion mortgage loan. We expect new DDR to have virtually no unsecured maturities until 2022, which significantly limits refinancing risk. On the spin itself, we expect to confidentially file the Form 10 this quarter and make a public filing sometime late in the second quarter. As David mentioned, we remain on track. I’d like to now touch on a few fourth quarter financial statement items. First, our plan to sell the 50 spin assets caused the change in our projected holding period, which in turn triggered a $259 million non-cash impairment on these assets, a significant portion of which is from Puerto Rico. Further impairments are possible if sale prices fall below new book values and/or from the ongoing process of rebuilding assets in Puerto Rico. This impairment does not change the year-end 2018 leverage or covenant forecast that we presented in December. Second, we received and recorded $8.5 million of business interruption insurance payments in the fourth quarter. These payments represent a partial payment against our claim to take and are thus below the ultimate reimbursement amount we expect to receive for each period. We are working with our insurer to receive regular business interruption payments as we negotiate finalized claim amounts. Finally, we received repayment of $49 million of the preferred securities associated with our Blackstone joint ventures in the fourth quarter, as well as $36 million subsequent in January as a result of the ongoing liquidation of that fund. Since the third quarter of 2017, we’ve received $91 million in total preferred proceeds. Lastly, we made no significant other adjustment to the carrying value of the preferred securities this quarter. I will now make a few comments on guidance before turning the call back to the operator for questions. We’ve provided new DDR operating FFO guidance of at least $0.15 per share for the third quarter of 2018, the first quarter post spin. We'd expect to provide further new DDR FFO guidance as the year progress. This is consistent with the dividend rates and AFFO payout ratio, is that we provided for new DDR at the time of the spin announcement in December. Embedded in this guidance are several assumptions. First, the same-store NOI guidance of at least 1.5% that we provided at the time of the spin announcement remains unchanged and already anticipated significant Toys ""R"" U.S store closures. G&A guidance of $70 million represents a run rate based on expenses in place in 4Q '17. This is consistent with our guidance for $10 million of external management fees for RVI that we’ve provided which should self assumes no 2018 asset sales. In actuality as RVI assets are sold RVI fees will fall as well. Finally, the year-over-year decline and interest income and GVC income is largely a product of the aforementioned ongoing sale of properties within our two remain Blackstone JVs and additional JV asset sales. As mentioned, we received $36 million of preferred equity in January, so please note that you will see a further step down in interest income in the first quarter of '18. With that, I’d like to turn the call to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just on the disposition, just wondering excluding what if you could provide some color around cap rates on the assets that you sold in Q4 and so far in Q1. And understanding that you’ve used on a few so far year-to-date, but just given the active marketing process that you’ve mentioned and others potentially under contract. May be you can give us a sense for disposition, and this is that your volume expected prior to this spin?
David Lukes: Sure, Christy. Happy too. If you look at Page 21 of the stuff you'll see that the pro rata share of ownership of the assets were sold in the fourth quarter. Only 5% comes from what was the relative impact on the cap rates, that we’ve talked about the 7.5% for the fourth quarter. It isn't really going to have a dramatic effect. I think the bigger question is what if we’ve seen sense then, and of the 135 million dollars we’ve closed year-to-date, the blended cap rate at bit lower than the average for fourth quarter. So, it really depends on the inventory. In general, the longer our disposition process goes, the better the assets are that are being sold. And so, we haven't really seen a whole lot of change in cap rates over the past couple of quarters. Projecting of the future, you got as a mine. I feel very good about our team being able to get such a large quantity of assets into the market in January, I think we’ve got a lot of active buyers that have successfully bought assets from our civil code, the best 12 months and we are feeling pretty good about where the market stands today. I can't iterate as you would heard in that. I think in prepared remarks, we expected the RVI process in those dispositions will accelerate through the year, right. So I would have more modest expectations, especially for the sake of conservatism where more modest expectations for that portfolio in the first half of the year and higher expectations in the second half.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then, just bigger picture I realize that you’re just coming off of a very long deleveraging period, but just given where your shares trade today, at just such a massive discount. When do you get to a point in terms of the new DDR and there's a lot of talked about that. When you can start doing share repurchases on a leverage neutral basis, where you can say, okay, we’re going to take more through our free cash flow and sort of limit redevelopment and not by any assets and just buyback your stock.
Matthew Ostrower: Well, probably the most important and exciting part of that question is that we’re actually able to discuss it. And I feel great about what’s ahead of us in the next 12 months. I think whether it's an asset purchase externally, whether it's a share repurchase, a fall off to the same thesis which is we’re going to be on our front foot. We have things to do and nothing is off the table, we’re trying to make an accretive purchase.
Christy McElroy: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead,
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on the disposition, so you completed $246 million of assets held at DDR share in the quarter. I think that compares to the $450 million expectation that you laid out at the announcement of the spin, which was to be completed through the year-end -- for 2018. Is there a desire to potentially raise more capital to the extent that that you can through asset sales and that the demand is there and to the extent you do where will incremental proceeds be applied?
David Lukes: Yes, look, I think the message is we move from -- in 2018 we move from outright delevering, which kind of forecloses a lot of options to: a, capital recycling position, right. So as ever and I think you will see that our overall strategy over time is going to be to constantly look at the assets that are at the lower growth rate side of the spectrum that have attracted pricing. And look to recycle those into higher growth assets. so, I think that answers -- I hope that answers your question. I think we really will be selling other things, but it won't be for the sake of delevering.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then, the financing $1,35 billion financing that you announced yesterday. I was just curious if you could comment on? How that changed if at all, since the announcement through closing whether there are a structuring changed at all or pricing or anything at all changed since the December announcement?
David Lukes: Yes, Todd. The reality is not much. So the way process worked and what we announced in December was something that we had a commitment on, right so we had signed a term sheet and in those term sheets you commit through all of the major terms of the loan. You have to then paper the loan which I shouldn’t underestimate the importance of and the kind of length stuff. But in reality all the move negotiations, all the key business points should be done by the time you sign that commitment and I would say that was very much the case in this instance. So nothing really changed.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And I don’t know if I missed this at all anywhere, but can you comment on the pricing?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes. It's difficult. So loan provides the lender's the right to syndicate, which would ultimately we think impact the interest rate on the loan. So we'd expect to provide more information on the loans rate and terms once we’ve greater clarity on that process.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon or good evening. I guess, still afternoon. So just a few questions here. First, just given -- actually let me ask this guidance one first. Matt, did you go over how much of the at least 1.5% same-store, how much of an impact toys and any other lease restructurings or closings that you guys maybe budgeting? So is that like -- is there 50 basis of NOI impact or some way to quantify the impact from what you expect from toys and others?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, we said in the prepared remarks that there was a 70 or so basis point impact this year from toys.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. So …
Matthew Ostrower: On the new DDR side, which is consistent with that 1.5% guidance.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, great. And then as far as the disposition side, we will talk more about the U.S assets not the Puerto Rico once again you’re trying to sell. Have you noticed any change in the buyer's like, it seems like on this quarter's earnings call, you all the REITs collectively are speaking about a better retail Environment, and sort of people feeling better coming off the sidelines to buy more assets. Are you seeing buyers willing to take on releasing risks or everyone pretty much wants 95% for assets and no one is saying, hey, don't renew that space, so that space we'd like to crack out it.
David Lukes: This is David. It's hard to note changes. And the reason I’d say that is we’re trying to be very careful about talking about what has happened and not projecting what may happen. But what has happened is a fairly consistent pace of dispositions with a pretty wide pool of buyers, most of which are using leverage, And I would say depending on the asset for sale, for instance triple net lease Walmart, there's a certain type of buyer that is not active in releasing. Other properties in secondary market that have some sharp occupancy or a Junior anchor vacancy, there are buyers that would like to have that leasing risk. So I think the pool is widen enough that there' is both types of buyers out there. And to be clear we’re selling an incredibly wide variety of assets, right. We are selling some single tenant Walmart's which is obviously not going to be any lease up opportunity and those buyers want a full bond like asset. And there's others where there is vacancy whether we like it or not. So it really is -- I mean, you could see what these volumes are still wide spectrum of what we’re selling. It's really hard to generalize.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, this is Ron Kamdem in for Richard Hill. Just a couple of quick questions here. The first one is on RVI. Obviously, looking at the -- that the dispositions that were done in 4Q, just thinking about the assets in the RVI portfolio. But if you could just provide more color of maybe how those compares in terms of size, maybe in terms of anchor mix and so on and so forth. Whether you’re feeling more or less comfortable about the velocity given what you've done in 4Q?
Matthew Ostrower: Are you -- I’m sorry, just to be clear, are you asking about RVI assets that we sold in the fourth quarter?
Ronald Kamdem: No, I’m asking about RVI assets that you're going to sell potentially …?
Matthew Ostrower: Compared with those- -- one that we sold in the fourth quarter.
David Lukes: That’s right.
Matthew Ostrower: Okay. I think the message has been pretty consistent on this, which is that we think the RVI assets are actually a good notch higher in quality than what we’ve been. Again, really hard to generalize and just because they’re higher in quality, it doesn’t mean the buyer pool is necessarily more robust. But all else being equal, if you want a generalization, I think we'd say that the cap rates for getting and the volumes we’re seeing should be a very positive indicator for the process we’re going to go through with RVI. The problem is things can change and cap rates can change and debt availability can change and so there is some uncertainty about that. But just comparing apples to apples the RVI stuff we think is better.
Ronald Kamdem: Great.
David Lukes: Ron, the other way to add to that is to say that when we started selling assets for the purpose of deleveraging, we tended to choose assets that we thought had some risks. When we talked about splitting the company and have a spin occur, we stated that we were taking the durable assets that were strong, but slower growth because they don't leave enough growth left in new DDR. So I would say if I had to put a title on them, I would say the RVI assets are very durable and safe. They just happen to be slower growing, the one we are left with.
Michael Makinen: And Ron, if you recall we have a slide in the December presentation. While we walk through the demographics, lease rate and RVI versus what we sold as well.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. That’s useful. And then, just on the debt, I was just wondering if guys have any color on investor feedback or reception on the pricing and on TL.
David Lukes: No, no feedback on that at this point.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then, so my last one would be just looking at the presentation, the monthly cash receipts for Puerto Rico. I just was curious, if there's any color in terms of -- obviously, you had a big bounce back in January. But if I’m looking at this correctly, it looks like it's even back to levels of July 17. I would have thought you will have more deceleration. Is that because of the Dave & Buster's? Just trying to understand what that -- what’s driving?
David Lukes: Add into our reopening and paying rent. I know Mike talked about in his part of the presentation, but I really would encourage you to look at the video. I think we’ve had a variety of people go to Puerto Rico and take a look at the assets and whether they’re self taught analysts or buy siders or other people just with interest the feedback is that my goodness I expected something really, really difficult and what I saw our assets had didn’t obviously had -- obviously had anything happen to them. So I really would encourage you to take a look for yourself. But the -- and the cash receipts show it. There is a rebound taking place on that Island.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much for the transparrency at all.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Sakwa: Thanks. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit about the redevelopment program. I guess the desire to play a little more offense and defense and you talked about some of these boxes that you’re getting back. Can you just remind us what you're planning to spend on the redevelopments and expansions in '18, and how that may unfold into '19?
David Lukes: I don't believe, Steve, and good evening. I don't believe we have guided to a specific dollar amount of redevelopments nor have we really described the breadth of the portfolio. I mean, obviously in the supplemental you’re seeing a fairly small amount of redevelopment activity that’s getting smaller every quarter. As you can probably imagine from our skill sets and interest in redevelopment, we're later focused on building that portfolio and would certainly look forward to describe it in more detail in the near future.
Michael Makinen: Steve, over the next two years we’ve obligations of about $40 million for the major redevelopment project, but to David's point that really just encompasses what’s in the program today.
Stephen Sakwa: Okay. And then maybe just to circle back a little bit on the 1.5% internal growth. I can appreciate the toys impact I think you said was specifically 70 basis points. But just to be clear, are there other just kind of catchall buckets that you’re putting in there for other potential tenants. And if so, was there a range of NOI hit that you are taking above and beyond the toys that’s embedded in the 1.5%?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, so it is less about buckets more we do a kind of space by space analysis, right as one does to understand what you expect in the coming year. We try to be conservative in that forecast and then we obviously try to put some contingency into our expectations to make sure that we're not overpromising anything. So, I think where I could guess, there's a variety of paper cuts out there for us in 2018, but we have -- as I can imagine we’re trying to make sure we’re providing you with some guidance that we know we can hit. So we’re providing for there to be more bankruptcies etcetera, less about a specific tenant. Things like some of the big names are gone for us now right in new DDR, we will have no serious exposure. So, there is not a bucket for sears specifically, but we are thinking there's a variety of other tenants that you can -- you hear about them on a daily basis, that are having some struggles and we’re trying to make sure we account for those.
Stephen Sakwa: Okay. I guess just last question, may be to go back to some of the asset sales and kind of the funding and the leverage. I realize each buyers are a little different, but do you have a sense for sort of the type of leverage or the amounts of leverage that you’re average kind of purchaser is using and obviously rates have backed up, maybe 50 basis points since the beginning of the year and how that might impact potential sales going forward?
David Lukes: It's a really good question, Steve. I mean, if we had a tremendous amount of transparency as to exactly what the buyers were doing, it would be an interesting note. The problem of course and even if you look in the supplemental, all the assets that were sold over the course in the last four quarters, there's a pretty wide variety and it's all over the country. And so it's hard to come up with an average of what people are using for leverage. I do think that CMBS marketplace are rolling. And I think if you’re going to see an impact in cap rates due to changes in interest rates, then that’s something that’s probably more on its way as opposed to something in the near distant past.
Matthew Ostrower: The only thing I would add is, we certainly learned through our process. You can imagine we have some insights on the CMBS market now. And I know people have concerns about how that market is functioning for certain types of assets like B malls, specifically or C malls, as it were. I would tell you that our experiences with that that market is alive and well. I think if you talk to people who actually do those syndications and those securitizations and/or involves in that market, they will tell you that its functioning very normally for the assets we’re trying to sell as well as the wide variety of other ones.
Stephen Sakwa: Okay, great. That’s it for me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, everyone. Just a quick question on -- just on the leasing side of things. It sounds like the conditions have state relatively stable from -- Maybe three months to go, but just curious, given the spin out announcement, I mean, does that change the discussions at all with the tenants as you’re trying to renegotiate. I mean, is there any concern out there from them about the potential for the assets to be moved into the spin out or I guess is the change conversation in anyway?
David Lukes: No. In fact, it haven't changed at all. I mean, we're basically talking to the tenants of our leasing space in both properties and both sets of properties and really feels exactly the same,
David Lukes: Okay. And then just maybe another follow-up on Steve's question about the bankruptcies and then theirs is some level of additional closures expected in the guidance range. But I’m just curious relative to on a year-over-year basis. I mean, is it assuming an improvement in the closure rate, similar to last year or worse?
David Lukes: I would say about the same. I mean, we’re assuming that and I think we believe that the bankruptcy environment is likely to stay challenging for a period of time. So we built our forecast around a pretty tepid environment or pretty tepid level of changes as far as bankruptcies are concerned.
Vincent Chao: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Ki Bin with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, Steven. Good evening, guys. So, just a few follow-ups here. The one thing I get maybe more concerned than just pure bankruptcies is as your tenants expire and as move Staples or Office Depot's come back, how much of the conversation is what we will renew, but only for half the space. And how is that baked into your guidance?
David Lukes: Hi, Kevin. I will take that the theory side and then Mike can add to it and then Matt could talk about the guidance. But that’s the subject matter that we talk about most frequently, particularly when it comes to budgeting because the larger risk in this type of portfolio today is that rents change with the worse as opposed to the positive at renewal. The reality is that reductions inside are somewhat uncommon because it's very expensive for the retailer. It's very hard to rely out of store and once they have a sales in a specific neighborhood, it's very difficult to have that sales volume transition that are taking some risks. And to date, I would say, unless you disagree, Mike, that the amount of risk that our retailers are willing to take to put their sales at risk, it's not just happening.
Michael Makinen: I think the most important thing, David, said is that from a retailer perspective the inside of the store and the layout of the store is incredibly difficult to change for two reasons. One because it's expensive physically, but two, because from a merchandising standpoint everybody is scraping and crawling for their space. And when you downsize a store something has to give and typically retailers become very reluctant to downsize and historically there's been very few who actually do it. So that conversation doesn't often come into play. Occasionally, it does but for the most part it doesn't represent a major proportion of our conversations.
Matthew Ostrower: From a forecasting perspective, it's really not an issue for 2018, right because 2018 is all about rent commencements. So those leases, for it to have any impact on our actual results in '18. You can imagine that we signed these leases some time ago. We do our forecast leads by lease, so we already know and even for leases we haven't signed yet. The leasing team is usually far advance with those expirations or having those conversation, so we have a enormous amount of transparency on that particular issue for the next 12-months at least.
Vincent Chao: Okay. And are lease modifications or rent lease in your spreads?
David Lukes: In what spread, sorry?
Vincent Chao: The spreads that you report.
David Lukes: Yes.
Michael Makinen: Yes.
David Lukes: It's a fully loaded number.
Vincent Chao: Okay, that’s helpful. And is it too early to give any kind of broad range of FFO for RVI? -- RBD?
David Lukes: Yes. Yes, it is too early -- I’m not actually certain that we’re going to be able to provide that guidance key event. It's really not an FFO story. It's going to be a story about generating proceeds for shareholders as quickly as we possibly can. And so FFO is going to be entirely dependent on transaction volumes which I’m sure you can hear us say already are just very difficult to predict. So recurring FFO is not -- I don’t think the way investors are likely to look at that investment.
Vincent Chao: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Yes, its Michael Bilerman. I’ve had a number of questions. The first is just relating to release time and hoping this call recognizes there is a lot of stuff going on in the back half of last year. The 20 minutes to review a 50 page stuff is not really that much time. So are you going to think about changing your reporting in conference call schedule in the future.
David Lukes: That’s actually the first time hearing of that. Michael, but as ever we’re always going to take the feedback and consider things.
Michael Bilerman: And 99% of the industry does it different ways. So I think more time would lead to more thoughtful questions to better analysis. The second question is that, Matt, can you walk through, you did $0.28 in operating FFO this quarter, new DDR will be at $0.15 in the third quarter at a minimum. Can you walk through the buckets that get you from $0.28 to $0.15?
Matthew Ostrower: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear the last part of your question, that get from what to what?
Michael Bilerman: So taking yourself from today, the $0.28 you reported to new DDR's FFO of $0.15. Can you just walk through the pieces and the components that you get there?
Operator: Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We are currently experiencing some technical difficulties with our speaker line. Please give one moment while we reconnect them. Pardon me everyone, I've rejoined our connection with the speaker line. Mr. Bilerman, if you are still online …
Michael Bilerman: I’m still here.
Operator: … you can continue with your question.
Michael Bilerman: Can you hear me now?
David Lukes: Yes.
Matthew Ostrower: Yes.
David Lukes: Sorry, Michael.
Michael Bilerman: I will start off -- maybe I will start off nicer. Maybe, if you have the call at like 7.30 in the morning, that would be better.
David Lukes: I’m sure that would make all the difference.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. Right, so I was trying to just -- there is a bunch of things in the supplemental of new DDR and RVI in Puerto Rico. What I'd love to be able if you can go through is, you obviously reported $0.28 of operating FFO this quarter. You're presenting a minimum of $0.15 for the third quarter, $62 million of FFO between those two numbers. Can you walk through the building blocks, some positive and some negative of getting from point A to point B?
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Michael. It's Conor. Sorry we got cut off there. So if you look at Page 5 of the slide deck you will see the major sources and uses for the first quarter. Obviously, that will have a fairly negative impact in terms of higher cost of debt or asset sales paying off, some debt with a lower cost as well as Page 13 of the supplement we break out the NOI for DDR and RVI. Those two pieces should get to the majority of the framework. The other three things I would add is we sold quite a few assets at the end of the fourth quarter. Obviously, that NOI would be included in the fourth quarter run rate. Happy to help you there. And then the last thing is Blackstone we’ve had quite a bit of preferred repaid as Matt outlined in his prepared remarks. So you will see a fairly significant decline in interest income starting in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. So, those three pieces of sources and uses for the first quarter as well as the breakout on page 13 of the supplement should get you there/ again, how to spend more times, if you like.
Michael Bilerman: And then how do we think about when you did the announcement of the spin, it was a $0.40 dividend. 75% targeted payout ratio. Historically, you’ve been FFO to AFFO about 80%, low 80s. So the 15 will take you down to $0.12 a share in AFFO. So I’m just not sure how all that sort of ties together with the way you presented your math, whether the $0.15 is an absolute bottom of range and that’s going to grow. And how we should think about the FFO versus AFFO drop.
David Lukes: Yes, I mean, you heard us talk about the fact that the goal for 2018 is to begin to grow. So I think that’s the most important comment. Did you want to add something, Conor?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. I would say, mass prepared remarks, we talked about that, that at least $0.15 is tied to the numbers we provide in December. So the $0.10 dividend, 25% payout ratio, so you could -- there's an implication there in terms of the growth for the fourth quarter, Michael. The other thing I would add is CapEx levels today are going to come down. We provided a break out of CapEx again on Page 13 for new DDR and also as a leasing volume as these leasings come back online or come online in the fourth quarter, you will start to see CapEx come down and NOI come up. So, those factors kind of tied to our $0.75 payout ratio number that we provided in December.
Michael Bilerman: And then just thinking about earnings and cash flow growth over time, because RVI is going to be effectively, a liquidating in its NAV story, Matt, you talked about non-earnings story. How do we think about the $10 million of fee income? Are you going to be able to cut the DDR organization by the same $10 million, so that there's not earnings hit in a year, 18 months or 24 months time that it won't be something else that we'd sort to have to deal at that point.
David Lukes: Michael, I think -- this is David. We’ve thought very carefully about how we structured the fee arrangement between the two companies and have been very careful to make sure that we’re not under a whole lot of pressure with respect to time. Certainly, as time goes on, we have to make some decision just to how much G&A we have in DDR and we will make those decisions. But I can assure you that we haven't structured the fees, so that we are going to get under water or have an earnings risk at some point.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Last question, just where are you guys currently on the Board, refreshed? Obviously, you’re trying to get two or three new Board Members at DDR. Can you share with us where the Board is in that process of identifying candidates and when those would be announced?
David Lukes: I can tell you that we are at a point where -- at a proxy season here. We’ve got a spin that was announced and so I think there's a lot of movement. The Board has been active in dialogue and thinking about strategically what we need for skill sets for these two different business plans. And we are into the proxy season here pretty soon. So I think we will have more information as we get closer to it.
Michael Bilerman: Great. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Thanks. Hi. Just two quick ones here. Mike you were talking about the small shop opportunity. Can you quantify about how much small shop occupancy pickup, you think you could have over the next 12 to 18 months. And then on the dispos, [ph] I just want to make sure I’m thinking about the right way for the $900 million people bogey, that is comparable to the 763 that you -- your pro rata share that you’ve sold year-to-date. So you’re looking for a ballpark and other 150 or so and sales to close that out, is that correct?
David Lukes: Yes, correct.
Mike Mueller: Okay.
David Lukes: With regard to the shop leasing question, we really initiated our amplified shop leasing efforts in the third quarter. And so far our progress has been very encouraging. I think the most important thing to mention is that shop leasing is really the blocking and tackling of the leasing efforts and it is decidedly unglamorous. And I think the most important thing to do in order to drive that business is to make the team culture built around recognizing that, driving that effort really can drive a lot of NOI growth, and effectively rewarded so that becomes glamorous. And what we're doing here is really no different than what I’ve done in some of my past experiences in former companies, and that is to use that philosophy to drive the growth. Right now we don't really have a specific target as to where we're going to peak as far as the occupancy for shop growth. But the results over the last few quarters are very encouraging and we should add more color on that in the next few quarters.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good evening and thanks very much for joining our first quarter earnings call. Last quarter, I highlighted three key areas of focus, namely, our return to growth, our balance sheet transformation and substantial leasing opportunities embedded in our portfolio. Our 1Q results provide evidence of progress on all three of these fronts. First, the RVI spin remains on track, moving us closer to the end of the dilutive, deleveraging process. Second, New DDR posted compelling leasing economics and strong same store NOI growth, despite tenant bankruptcies. Finally and most importantly, New DDR's curated portfolio is allowing us to assemble a value accretive redevelopment pipeline. Now on to the business of the call. I'll review our results and then provide an update on growing redevelopment opportunities and recent DDR transaction activity. I'll then hand the call over to Mike for comments on operations and we'll close with some comments from Matt on the balance sheet, RVI and guidance. Operating FFO in 1Q was $0.03 ahead of our budget but down from last year as dilution from deleveraging weight on earnings. As I mentioned, we expect this headwind to end in 2018. Operationally, the first quarter demonstrates the high quality of our real estate and sustainable tenant demand was solid leasing economics within the new DDR portfolio highlighted by 21% new leasing spreads and 2.6% same store NOI growth. This positive momentum was driven by rent commencements on a range of previously vacant anchor spaces and continued small shop leasing progress. These results are solid by any measure and we're ahead of our internal expectations. Result including the RVI, continental U.S. assets weren't bad either with 1.5% same store NOI growth. Overall, our portfolio clearly performed well this quarter, despite difficult occupancy comparisons. Going forward, the Toys bankruptcy generates some challenges in the form of additional vacancy, but the headwinds will be partially mitigated by the backfill of vacant space and continued small shop leasing. More importantly, these empty boxes also allow us to recapture control of space and parking field at some of our best assets, facilitating economically attractive redevelopment projects. One of the characteristics that we look for when curating the new DDR portfolio with land use efficiency. In other words, we favor properties with a strong likelihood of increasing in value as current tenants expire or lose their lease control. Control is the key feature that allowed us this quarter to move forward with three new redevelopment projects, which are now listed in our supplemental. In Brandon, Florida KMart controlled 100% of the common area and 58% of the site GLA through their long term lease. We purchased a terminations controlled now the well located site and have zero current direct exposure to Sears or K-Mart in the new DDR portfolio. At Sandy Plains village in the Atlanta MSA, we purchased a termination of Wal-Mart, which controlled 60% of the coming area and 34% of the GLA. We now control over half of this site within a high income neighborhood. At Shoppers World in Framingham, Massachusetts, we've been holding certain spaces vacant and renegotiating clauses within others existing leases in order to facilitate a new site master plan. The last critical check piece fell into place when Babies “R” Us liquidated and we now have control of a meaningful redevelopment zone. All three of these locations are in active dial with zoning and planning departments and it progressed well over the course of the last nine months. In the coming quarter or two, we hope to be in a better position to share our detailed plans for the properties as well as pre-leasing progress. But I had to say we are increasingly excited about the retenanting and densification opportunities on these well located sites which will become a larger part of our story in the future. Shifting to transactions. We closed in the sale of our first RVI asset last week. Specifically, we sold Silver Spring Square in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania for $81 million to an institutional buyer at better economics then transactions closed to date. This is a solid beginning to the RVI disposition process. We're making progress on additional transactions and will provide more information on RVI asset sales as they occur. We're also though continue to execute on our original $900 million disposition program selling over $370 million of assets in the first quarter at a blended cap rate of about 7.4% and closed an additional $189 million subsequent to quarter end. First quarter transactions included the first portfolio deal we've done in some time, the sale of nine public anchor centers in our Madison joint venture to Publix as part of the retailers' initiative to increase ownership of centers in which it operates. As our disposition volume for the last year indicates, our top tier transactions team continues to execute at a breakneck pace. Asset level debt markets are open, private market buyers are active, and our recent activity gives us confidence in our ability to execute. Before handing the call over to Mike, I'd like to close by restating how excited our whole team is with our impending shift from a capital allocation strategy focused exclusively on deleveraging to one focused on redevelopment and opportunistic investing. All of which is supported by a curated portfolio of asset with outstanding locations. The incredibly dynamic retail environment in which we find ourselves certainly provides its share of challenges. But I strongly believe it increasingly provides opportunities for profit as well, opportunities we intend to pursue tirelessly. We are eager to share our thoughts in this environment and our business strategy something we intend to do in detail at an Investor Day we will be hosting in New York City on the 11 September. Please keep your eyes peeled for a Save the Date with more details in your inbox shortly. And with that I'll turn it over to Mike to review some key operating conclusions.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. I'll start by summarizing the three key operational takeaways. One, same store NOI growth in the continental U.S. was strong. Two, leasing spreads were robust. And three, Puerto Rican operations were better than expected. On same store NOI, as David mentioned, first quarter growth for the New DDR portfolio was 2.6% which was ahead of our budget. Results were fueled by ongoing progress refilling box vacancies, as well as commencement of rent from the greater volume of small shop leases we began signing six months ago. Second, in the continental U.S. we continue to make steady progress on the leasing front. Importantly, New DDR's occupancy was flat overall compared to last quarter and our small shop leasing program remains in focus. Total leasing volumes for all spaces were roughly in line with the trailing 12 month average and blended New DDR leasing spreads were nearly 9% roughly in line with last quarter. Refilling Toys boxes will require some CapEx, but given the mark-to-market and redevelopment opportunities David mentioned, we believe the returns on this capital will be attractive. On Toys “R” Us, We now have two boxes rejected in the bankruptcy process that have closed. Two additional stores with assumed leases and one space that we recently purchased. While we do not yet have timing specifics on the other 16 leases, we have budgeted the balance to close within the next month or so. In terms of overall operating environment, conditions remain generally unchanged, tenant demand remains steady and the quality of New DDR's assets it's high now that our properties remained highly sought after by all the expanding tenants with whom we do business. We have so far seen minimal impact to supply demand dynamics from the Toys liquidation announcement. In Puerto Rico, first quarter operations were steady versus the fourth quarter. Good evidence of the resilience of our assets. We continue to make strides operationally, especially on repairing damage spaces and keeping our centers well occupied. I mentioned last quarter that we opened the island's first Dave and Busters location at Plaza del Sol and we now have feedback indicating that this opening was the change strongest ever. I am pleased to report that our Plaza Palma Real shopping center which incurred the most damage in the hurricane had a grand reopening of its Wal-Mart anchor just last week with traffic consistent with a typical Black Friday. The recovery story is compelling and we're seeing positive sales accounts key national anchors like Wal-Mart and Home Depot. Our least rate fell approximately 250 basis points since the fourth quarter, a product primarily of the closure of our only Toys “R” Us box on the island. Rent on that space was in the low single digits, limiting the NOI impact of the closure. In all, I'd say that despite challenges, Puerto Rico is doing much better than many would think. I'd like to extend a huge thank you to our construction and property management team based both on the island and in the continental U.S. for their help with the work today. With that I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks Mike. I'd like to make some comments on our balance sheet and then provide some color on guidance and RVI before handing the call back over to the operator for questions. First on the balance sheet. We continue to target pro rata net debt-to-EBITDA of roughly six times by the end of 2018. It takes time to lower leverage, so we've aggressively addressed our maturity structure as a way of lowering risk in the interim. As a result of both our 2017 bond financings and the tender offer associated with the RVI mortgage, New DDR's pro forma average debt maturity of 6.3 years excluding the RVI mortgage is now among the highest in the peer group. Pro forma for RVI and dispositions, we have only $179 million of debt or less than 10% of our debt outstanding maturing prior to 2022. Debt-to-EBITDA increased modestly from 4Q, despite additional assets sales. This was a product of the full quarter EBITDA impact of the high volume of late 4Q disposition, as well as the $56 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in the quarter related to mortgage repayments and the unsecured bond tender. Likewise, our secured debt ratio rose this quarter, which was a product of the $1.35 billion RVI mortgage loan and the repayment of unsecured debt. We expect all of our bond and leverage metrics to improve in the back half of the year when RVI and its mortgage are spun and we complete the core DDR disposition program. Included in our transaction activity disclosure is an additional $36 million repayment of preferred securities associated with our two Blackstone joint ventures. As a reminder, we established a valuation reserve for these securities roughly a year ago, cutting value by $76 million to $270 million. Since then we have achieved key sales threshold levels at both joint ventures allowing us to receive approximately 50% of equity proceeds from asset sales going forward. We recognize a current 6.5% yield on the preferred securities, so every dollar we get back is the earnings equivalent of an asset sale at a 6.5% cap rate. The ventures have sold the total 38 of the 82 original assets as of March 31, generating total preferred repayment to us of $91 million. We marked all Blackstone assets to market each quarter, resulting in a $15 million preferred valuation increase in the third quarter of 2017 and $4 million decrease this quarter. We're making great progress selling assets, reducing our investment in those JVs and lowering DDR's leverage as a result. I'd like to draw your attention to some changes we've made to our redevelopment disclosure on Page 16 of our supplement. We renamed the minor redevelopment category tactical redevelopment and have taken a more conservative approach to the projects listed in this category. Projects we removed will now appear in our recurring a leasing capital expenditures that we report each quarter. What's left in the tactical category are smaller redevelopments, generally in the $2 million to $3 million range including first generation space, expansions and out parcel development. A final earnings housekeeping item worth mentioning is some of the ongoing accounting associated with Puerto Rico. We received and recognized an advance of our business interruption insurance of $2 million this quarter. This is lower than the $8.5 million we received in the fourth quarter of 2017. The smaller BI advance this quarter represents good evidence of tenant reopening and rent payment as we continue to recover from the hurricane. In the case of both payments, the advance represents only a portion of the ultimate BI compensation we expect to receive for those time periods. With a return of normal fee to our assets, we expect these payments to remain at lower levels. Our current estimate of total cost, excluding business interruption remains approximately $150 million consistent with last quarter. We continue to work with our insurer to reach agreement on a final thing amount and settlement. I'd like to now touch on a few comments on our projections. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2018 results, I'd like to flag a couple of items. First, we expect the second quarter to mark the weakest same store NOI growth rate of the year, largely because we start to feel the brunt of the Toys closures ahead of the expected rent commencement of released former hhgregg and forethought the lease spaces later this year. Likewise, OFFO per share should decline sequentially in the second quarter, largely a product of a full quarter impact of the higher interest rate of the higher interest expense associated with the $1.35 billion RVI mortgage loan for an entire quarter, as well as lower JV fee income and NOIs and dispositions. On RVI fees, additional asset sales could adversely impact the property and asset management fee guidance of $10 million that we outlined last quarter. That said, timing of sales is inherently unpredictable, so we are not revising guidance for those items. As we mentioned previously, we've remained highly focused on our DDR expense structure and have made adjustments, so that any decline in fees will likely be offset. Lastly, our key 2018 earnings assumptions and guidance is unchanged, including the expectation that we will achieve at least 1.5% same store NOI growth and operating FFO per share of at least $0.15 in the third quarter, which is based on the assumption that the spin of RVI occurs in early July. We had anticipated a potential Toys liquidation when we first provided our forecast last year, so this outcome is not sufficient for us to change our NOI growth expectations. Turning to the spin of RVI, we remain on track for a mid-2018 effective date. The loan securitization process is now complete, locking in a rate of LIBOR plus of 315 basis points. Given the current market uncertainty, I am thrilled that we achieved an all-in rate of about 5% on this $1.35 billion deal. We are going through the requisite registration process with the SEC hopefully putting us on track to consummate the spin-off in early July. The closing and securitization of the RVI mortgage loan represented the last major hurdle to the spin of these assets. With that I would like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Yeah it's Christy here for Michael. Hey guys, just we've been hearing about some recently offered DDR, just maybe you could provide some color on that what departments within the organization were most impacted and were these anticipated in the context of the prior G&A forecast?
Michael Makinen: Hey, Christy, I am Michael. I would say that the changes we had over the past week were exclusively due to the fact that the company has gotten smaller. We have a strategy that has included deleveraging, we're working on a spin-off of certain assets and I'd say our company is now right sized for that strategy which we outlined in December.
Christy McElroy: And then David, you talked a lot about the redevelopment pipeline in your opening comments on a go-forward basis, you added three new projects in Q1. How do you feel like your position today within the organization to ramp up redevelopment activity? And Matt maybe you can also provide some comments just from a funding and balance sheet perspective on a go-forward basis, is that some of that ramp up occurs?
David Lukes: Sure, Christy. If you think about the scope of redevelopment project, you can say that there's three phases. There's a control phase, where you have to gain control of the property from the tenant leases. There's a consent phase where you have to get approval from municipal government. And there's an obligation phase, which you're trying to lease tenants they have an obligation to pay rent which is a reason for making the investment. Our staffing right now has been increasing not decreasing on the development staff. We have new staff in Columbus, we have new staff in Atlanta, we have new staff in Southeast, frankly to fill up some of these new pipelines of investments. And I think you'll see our team continue to grow as these project moves from the control through the consent through the obligations phase will simply staff up to fill those projects over the coming years.
Matthew Ostrower: In terms of funding, Christy that part of the question, we obviously we have $1 billion line of credit for any bridge financing needs we have there. But - and I do think the funding is going to - the funding needs will ramp slowly here. So it's not like we're going to face a wall of capital requirements. But we will continue to recycle capital and we do generate some free cash flow as a result of the new dividend. So we have verity of source we can draw from there.
Christy McElroy: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Actually follow-up on Christy's question. Has employee more overall at DDR and I know you guys when you were at every one change some of the KPIs and how people were structured and compensated for different things, any comments on that?
David Lukes: I think everything is moving along pretty. I think people are excited about the future. We've been talking a lot about the redevelopment project. We've had a lot of group meetings with the leadership team, most of which are in the room here today right now. And I think everyone is looking forward to the next chapter.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. So no major changes on how people are measured on leasing or anything major?
David Lukes: Well yeah Ki Bin, I think you remember of course the past year, Mike made some pretty substantial changes to the leasing compensation. His leadership is also in the room here today. And I would think culturally, the whole company is going to eat what they kill and that starts with the sales side of the business. So the leasing culture this year is more likely to be more profitable personality than they were last year because they're going to do an excellent job of leasing.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And your same store NOI, I noticed your OpEx was down, any color on that?
David Lukes: No. I don't have a specific comment on that I can follow-up with you offline.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Just I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the disposition pipeline for RVI assets, now that those assets are on the market, maybe just some color around the level of interest you're seeing for those assets both the domestic portfolio and also Puerto Rico?
David Lukes: Sure, be happy to Todd. Let me just clarify one thing, when we say into the market, I think there's two ways to look at that. The first is that when we announce the spin of a company whose purpose in business plan is to recognize any of these are asset sales, we're effectively communicating that all of the assets are for sale. All of the assets are not in the market listed with brokers right now. So we're selling the ones that are in good position to be sold. We've gotten a lot of the feedback from the market, the only one where we have definitive data is the first one to close last week which we mentioned on our prepared remarks. And as projects get further along and do when it close then we'll offer some specifics along the way.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And are you able to share cap rate for the Silver Spring deal, it looks like it was sort of a low 7% cap rate on in place NOI, is that right? And also, the $66 roughly million of debt that was retired in conjunction with the sale of that asset, that pay down goes toward the $1.35 billion mortgage, is that right or is that not necessarily the case still the spin is complete?
David Lukes: First of all you're correct, when you sell a property to an institutional investor, most of the time there's an agreement that we won't cap rate which is unfortunate. But the proceeds, a portion of it goes down to pay down the debt. There's also an overage beyond a release price which builds up kind of a pool that we can use it if future assets fails, don't go so well. So this one was pretty much good news all the way around for RVI.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And just one more, the Toys ""R"" Us box that you acquired, are you looking to acquire any additional toys boxes in the portfolio, in any sense how many more might be assumed?
David Lukes: We absolutely are interested and intrigued by acquiring more of toys boxes within our New DDR refined useful for redevelopment, but I can't give you an expression to how many.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good afternoon, guys. I just want to go back to maybe some of your prepared comments. If I understood it correctly, toys liquidation was anticipated in your guidance, I think that was referring to the 1.5% same store NOI for New DDR. You put up a pretty decent number for New DDR this quarter of I think around 26 or so. So how should we think about that for the rest of the year? I mean why not raise same store NOI guidance at this point given the big number you put up particularly if Toys ""R"" Us was already baked in?
David Lukes: I would say it's baked in. This quarter we didn't really feel much Toys ""R"" Us, we will feel the Toys ""R"" Us as the year progress. So you would rightly expect holding all else equal that things should decelerate from here.
Rich Hill: Understood. Okay. And then just one more question. I guess going back to your sale of assets. I know you can't disclose what or you're not wanting to disclose at this point how much is in the market, but are you sensing that cap rates are coming in better than your expectations for maybe the 7% to 8% range where you've been selling previously or how discussions been going with perspective buyers?
David Lukes: Let me just be clear on what we have in the market, just to make sure that there's clarity. Certain assets are right for sale when you have leases that options have had exercised for example or we've kind of prep the property for sale. And it takes time to do that. One of the beauties of the RVI business plan and particular CMBS that we have on it, is that it gives us a couple of years execute on a business plan, which means the leasing department, the property management department can all get together and make sure that the properties are well positioned for sale. By doing that, you appeal though a much wider group of institutional buyers and usually the pricing ends up better than if you simply have a transaction dump something on the market. So I feel very good about the pace of dialogue between buyer and seller. We do have a huge inventory on the market right now. But as you can see, we've been selling a couple of $100 million a quarter and it feels like on an individual asset basis, we're getting plenty of dialogue. As the prices come in, we close deals, we'll see over time how it's going to relate to our original projections.
Rich Hill: Got it. Just one more quick question. I guess the assets that you sold away from that were not included in RVI. Did I hear that correctly that those were 7.4% cap rate?
David Lukes: Yeah.
Rich Hill: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Oh, hey, good evening. Just a few questions here. The first is just going back to Christy's on the layoffs. Some of the folks that we had heard were involved or some of the like senior folks, some of the senior leasing. So can you just I mean obviously not asking for odd chart, but just in general you know it sounds like you've also been doing some hiring as you do redevelopment, so have you been restructuring the leasing and maybe bring in new leasing people or just want to reconcile what we've been hearing with the way you guys have been implementing your strategy?
David Lukes: Yeah, I appreciate that. It's a valid question. You know reality is that there's enough experience in this room to have an opinion as to how to run the day to day operations of the company. And we're simply going to do what's best for shareholders along the way. In some cases that means opening new positions for instance in redevelopment in other parts of the country not in Cleveland. And other times that means hiring new positions in Cleveland or promoting people from within the company which we've had a number of over the past months. But when it comes to positions that are no longer available at the company, it's really does really due do size. The company had changed dramatically in size but not dramatically in focus. We're focused on a much smaller group of assets and I think you're already seeing the fruits of that focus by getting assets into the redevelopment pipeline.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then Matt, is there a severance charge that we should expect in the second quarter associated?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, Can you quantify?
Matthew Ostrower: Not this time.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just the final question is, on auto, he has remained an active supporter of the stock in buying. Are there limitations in his whether as a as a foreign entity or his original agreement with the company that limits how much of the stock he can own or is he sort of free to acquire as much as he wants within the five or fewer rule obvious?
David Lukes: Now there is information you can look how effectively his organization is restricted to a maximum of 29.8%. Right now, if you go on, if you go look under the data that you could see that he is somewhere between 18% and 20% and he's been a strong supporter of the stock. But more than that I would say you know both Alex and his colleague Thomas have been an absolute pleasure and they're heavily focused on the real estate and they share operational ideas. So we're certainly proud to have them between 18% and 20%.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Vincent Chao: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just want to go back to the disposition commentary a little bit, it sounds like you need to sell these volumes here and getting pretty good interest on the RVI assets throughout there. Just curious if there's been any change in some of the larger properties we're hearing of you less demand for you know properties greater than say $15 million or so?
David Lukes: Yeah. I think to be perfectly honest, it's a little bit of an untested question for the RVI asset sales, we happen to sell the first one with $80 million, a number of the other ones that we're working on are smaller. It just so happens that a couple of the largest assets within RVI, we're waiting for certain tenants to exercise options over the next couple of months. So I'd say we're going to be a little bit delayed before we all see the result of larger assets being sold. There is an important feature that we were able to get into the CMBS mortgage and that is that we do have the right to separate some of the larger properties into smaller components. So for instance we could sell off some of the net lease parcels, we could separate assets into entertainment sections, grocery factions, power sections. So it's likely, if we see the results of what you're suggesting that the pool is larger for smaller asset then we'll likely list these in smaller components.
Matthew Ostrower: Just to put a final point on it, I mean we have as much as - this is a concern we've had and lots of people have raised over the last, not just the last couple of months but over the last year or two as there's been less institutional participation in the private capital markets for these assets. But I would just point out I mean we did so, we set Silver Spring and we gave you enough information, you know that was a pretty decent cap rate. And we also sold another asset for $66 million. This year there's been a couple of them that are you know very decent sized assets. They obviously would have an outsize impact on our cap rate that we disclosed during the quarter, if they were really terrible cap rate. So I think you've got enough to know that at least as of right now from the stuff that we've been doing, the market's not way out of whack.
Vincent Chao: Okay, thanks for that. And then just going back to toys as well, I think last quarter you quantify the impact in the 1.5% has now 70 basis points, you know just given the timing of when the stores were closed. I mean does that seem like that number will be significantly different, just given I think total exposure that 1.9% so about half of your convention there?
David Lukes: Yeah, that's right.
Vincent Chao: Okay. And then one final one for me. Just on the lease commence spread, I mean we already talked about 2Q being the Max Payne for seems store NOI growth because of toys and head of the openings that are already filled. I guess should we expect 3Q and 4Q openings to be relatively ratable or do you think it will be more 4Q weighted?
David Lukes: You know it's a little early to say and I want to be very careful, I am always hesitate to kind of the quarter by quarter stuff, because we can pretend that we have more precision here than we really have. The reality is you know as I said 2Q will be a bit weaker, you'll see better numbers than that in the 3Q and 4Q, but it's hard for me to give you exact numbers there at this point.
Vincent Chao: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Hoglund with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
George Hoglund: Hi Guys. I was just wondering if you could give some color beyond Toys ""R"" Us or you know store closings, what are your expectations at least from you know some of the larger tenants or some of the tenants you're expecting more boxes back?
Michael Makinen: This is Mike. I think the general answer to that is that we're very mindful and cognizant of a lot of the speculation that's out there. And two things; number one, we're always focused on those spaces when they're subject tenant that has some concern. But I think from a bigger picture standpoint, I think one of the things that's important to stress is the fact that when we selected our portfolio for New DDR, we really didn't consider the presence or absence of the tenants that are on the risk list if you will, we're really focused on the real estate. And so we feel very confident that if something were to transpire where there were more losses, we've been a good position because of the quality of the real estate. But there's nothing thematic. If you look at kind of you know we do all of our forecasting in budgeting you know space by space, you wouldn't see anything particularly thematic like a slew of boxes from one particular tenant or anything like that, there are one-off that we know about, but there's nothing that you would see that was particularly I think interesting or a long one particular thing.
George Hoglund: Okay. And then as far as backfilling any toys boxes you get back, I mean do you envision these being you know more or so boxes getting split up and redeveloped or is there tenant demand who you know backfill a whole box?
Michael Makinen: I think it's going to be a variety of approaches. As David mentioned, several of these were really gaining control, so that we can do some redevelopment around the real estate. But I do think it would be a combination of handful of tenants they might take the entire space and a significant number of tenants which will split those space into multiple tenant uses.
George Hoglund: Okay. And then just last one for me. Any sense that elevate level of store closures will impact the pace of asset sales?
David Lukes: Well, I think you know there's, less liquidation already had an impact on a couple of RVI assets because they were tenants, so have to decide whether we're going to release those and selling at later date or whether we're going to sell them with the potential vacancy. So there has been some impact. But the general buyer environment right now is not heavily focused on store closing, it's really focused on the durability of the existing cash flows. And a lot of those assets that we're selling are very strong properties that happen to be sub-market but you can measure the cash flows and feel pretty confident that it's durable.
George Hoglund: Alright, thanks guys. I appreciate the color.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Gooladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Gooladay: Yeah, hi guys. Just want to follow-up on the last question on George asked. What do you expect the overall budget for a car, Lambor work in TIs [ph] to range foreclosure is, and how are some of the large format tennis that just may assume the boxes and.
David Lukes: The first for that question is, the range is so great that it's really impossible to answer in one fell swoop. As far as prospective tenants interested in the boxes, there's a handful out there that's range from large format grocery operators to other national box tenets. Unless you'll notice that we did one assumed by Flannigan in our Princeton asset. So that is a single user of a single large box. So as Mike said, I think it's just too early to know on the CapEx side and what the outcomes are going to be. We are working on it, but there's no easy answer yet. Keep in mind the Babies ""R"" Us spaces are in the 30,000 foot range, so they're not exactly large boxes, they're more junior boxes., so it's very feasible that those could be single users and some of the toys boxes are larger which are the more likely candidates to be split.
Wes Gooladay: Okay. And then you mentioned a lot about getting control of property, so you do large scale redevelopments, is there any marquee project that you can do maybe in the next two or three years that you could highlight that you're just trying to get control of right now?
David Lukes: I would be so incredibly enthusiastic to highlight that once we actually have control.
Wes Gooladay: Okay.
David Lukes: Look, we already got control in Shoppers World which is fantastic. And that trade area is massive and I think this whole company has looked at Shoppers World probably a decade wishing we could do something and that we have chance. So there is a lot of good news stories that I think the culture here is pretty enthusiastic about and gaining control of a couple of 100,000 square feet of anchor space which basically means a 0.5 million square feet of land is a lot for a company of our size the one quarter. So we've got a great road ahead whether we're successful on winning some of the bids for additional toys boxes, we'll see over the next couple of months.
Wes Gooladay: Okay. And then last one for me. With - how should we think of co-tenancy, is there an issue we need to be concerned about it be a multiple boxes in a center close or is that just not the way it works?
David Lukes: Overall that's not a major concern.
Wes Gooladay: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with UBS. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Oh thanks. Just going to be you give the net effective rent numbers in the supplemental which is helpful, but do you - can we get a feel for what has that - what is the number look like on a like a releasing spread basis?
Matthew Ostrower: If you think net affective, I haven't calculated that. We can look into doing that, but I don't have that in my fingertips for you. It's a good question.
Nick Yulico: Okay. I'm just wondering if it's anywhere close to the releasing spreads that just you site otherwise?
Matthew Ostrower: I would say, I'll speculate here and I would say I don't think you're going to see a massive difference there. When you re-tenant a box, you spend money. So whether it's the second generation, the third generation, the Fourth generation you spend money. And so I think and those clock have not inflated massively. So my instinct would be that you might be a somewhat lower number but it's not going to be a dramatic change.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Just one other question is, if you look on that page at the under new leases for the total CapEx and a life so the lease, it looks like you're spending about call it roughly $50 a foot for these new leases. I guess the question is, is there additional redevelopment capital that that's not shown on this page that we need to assume above and beyond that $50 a square foot as we think about toys, those boxes how you deal with that or even other future boxes that that might come up?
Matthew Ostrower: No, I think I believe very strongly that these numbers are fully loaded. There are other projects that we do that have nothing to do with leasing that aren't in these numbers obviously but as it relates to doing leases and all the costs you can think of associated with that we really try to fully load these numbers.
Nick Yulico: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Good afternoon. Can you describe how the new anchor vacancies impact the plan disposition that RVI, as sooner there were anchor closes, are you going to try to lease that space before it sale or do you sell on the center with significant big box vacancy, like how do you balance kind of maximizing price versus getting maybe quicker execution on some of these plan dispositions?
David Lukes: It's a very impression question right over the past months and I think the answer surprisingly depends on the buyer. You know I'd say, if a man wants a blue suit sell him a blue suit. And right now the buyers tend to prefer properties that have some story line, some upside component. And so the cap rate tends to be actually better when you got some liquidity in junior anchor space and there's something to do on the property. So some of them where we have anchor vacancies, we will be selling into the market, so that someone else can buy an idea, can buy a dream. There is other properties where if it's a really large piece of the total NOI for the property then we pull it for the market, our leasing guys will take care of it and we'll probably put it on the market sometime next year.
Vince Tibone: That's helpful color. You also mentioned the potential to cut up larger centers to get better execution on sale. Is there an active market for vacant anchor boxes, like is that potentially an opportunity to just sell kind of vacancy and the kind of upside potential there? And then related like what is the ballpark value in your mind of a dark former Toys “R” Us box?
David Lukes: Generally speaking there is definitely a market for vacant boxes if it's on a separate land parcel that has its own camp and doesn't have a reciprocal lease agreement with an adjacent property. So a standalone department store or a standalone Toys ""R"" Us it's not an individual parcel. But if it is part of a larger collection of boxes in our junior anchor center or if it's buried within a grocery anchored property, there's almost no market to individually sell those assets. Some buyers historically have tried to purchase the leases and be a sandwich position landlord, but generally speaking, the highest and best function for RVI would be to sell an entire property all together as opposed to splitting out the vacancies.
Vince Tibone: That's really helpful. Thanks, that's all I have.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up question from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hi, great good afternoon and thanks for the extra 20 minutes with the sub in later call, so thank you. David, I was wondering if you can provide some updated in terms of new board members for New DDR and where you stand in the process and the timing of those announcements?
David Lukes: Sure, I'd be happy to. You probably noticed in our disclosures, if you think about since I started a year ago, we had one new board member Jane DeFlorio, start about a year ago. The announcement of the RVI spin has released the fact that three board members will be leaving DDR proper i.e. New DDR, two of them will be going on to the RVI and one is not seeking reelection. And so what that means is by the time we get through the proxy season and into the spin being completed, we need to put a new independent director at least one on both boards. So a total of two or more independent directors is what we're in the market for. And I think you would have to see an announcement before the spin takes place on DDR board that could be the remainder of the year as we look for the right individual.
Michael Bilerman: I guess where you in that process, are you down to a couple of candidates at this point, you feel confident that you're going to have those?
David Lukes: Yeah, I feel great. We met a lot of people, we've networked and asked the opinions of a lot of folks in the industry to give us some ideas and we've met a wide and pretty diverse range of people. We're interviewing for both boards and so it is exciting to think about the skillset that's required for each different business plan and I think we've had a lot of people recognize that the two unique business plans would be exciting to be beyond as a director and the director roll the candidates I think it's been really healthy for us to select from.
Michael Bilerman: Matt, if you look at Page 10 of the supplemental, where you have the same store disclosure for the company at 100% and then DDR at your share and obviously then breaking out between new DDR and RVI, there's a pretty wide gap between the total portfolio which includes all the Blackstone and other joint ventures where you are a minority partner and the total DDR. Simple math would indicate that those joint ventures are actually potentially even negative from the same store perspective. Is there anything that you can highlight about the differential between sort of all the joint venture assets and how those are performing versus wholly owned assets?
Matthew Ostrower: Yeah, it's a good question. So yes, I think you could do the math and figure out that the JV this quarter at least were negative. It's hard, it's something that we look at, it's hard to generalize Michael, I would say that now if you have a lot of assets that are in JV but you have a lot of different JVs in that overall pool, right and some of those JVs have really, really great assets and some of them have less great assets and without getting into all the details, you'll see some differential performance there. But I think that the negativity there hasn't been longstanding, so I don't think we're expecting that to continue. But you're right, there is some divergence and performance.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. But if you look at the top of the page, excluding Puerto Rico and the commence rate at least on the leasing perspective, it's not that different, so I don't know if there's other things going on. I mean the expenses are playing into part of it, which I'd love to be able to know your recovery rate effectively has gone up pretty dramatically in the company, so trying to understand that differential as didn't know if there was other maybe one time things that were happening because of that differential?
Matthew Ostrower: It's not. I would love to be able to point that kind two easy bullets to give you and again I think is maybe we look at but it's not an easy story like that, it's a variety of different pieces.
Michael Bilerman: And nothing on the expense side jumped out of you, you look at these numbers right, the operating expenses down 5%, real estate taxes down 1.5% but your recovery is only down 1%, there wasn't anything in particular there that made this quarter an anomaly?
Matthew Ostrower: No, not really.
Michael Bilerman: Thinking about the joint ventures on Page 23 and I know you're sort of in the market of selling the whole owned RVI as well as joint venture assets. How should we think about the remaining joint ventures and how much of this stays within the company over the next 12 to 36 months, especially given the fact that there's a big mortgage loan coming due in 2019 in three?
Matthew Ostrower: The BRE, I think we've been very clear is selling - is in liquidation mode right, that's what generating, when we first got here which generated the accounting adjustment there the reserve. And so you should assume it, as it relates to that mortgage loan et cetera, there's a lot of moving parts there, but generally speaking those assets are being marketed for sale in orderly fashion. DDRM, you will have seen this quarter that there were some asset sales, we mentioned a portfolio sales for public. That JV was formed with the intention of selling certain assets including those that we just announced. There will be some incremental asset sales from there. Those are of course are largest JV interest and that kind of gives you a sense for the capital picture for those. The other ones I would say things are going to be much more one-off and opportunistic in nature and much more difficult to describe and some kind of a thematic. We do think they're going to be sticking around, they're not in liquidation mode. There may be some trades and asset back and forth. But really the BRE and the Madison are the big pieces there.
Michael Bilerman: And then question for Mike, just Page 12 and 13 on the leasing summary. You look at the new leases sign this quarter, you're about a year shorter on duration. Is there anything going on there I mean how much of that's driven by the tenants versus your desire to go short of duration to get the appropriate rent, I don't know if there were specific leases that's driving that to be shorter as well?
Michael Makinen: The majority of that is on our side looking to get better rents in the long term as opposed to singing up longer term rents that we're unhappy with.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. And this last question back Matt, in terms of release pricing and debt paid down for the RVI loan, the secured mortgage loan, if you sold that asset like $80 million, what is the requirement then to retake debt versus how should, is there some mechanics that we can start thinking about and how that will unfold?
Matthew Ostrower: Michael, it's Matt. You should assume 100% of net proceeds from RVI asset sales to pay down debt.
Michael Bilerman: So that asset sale would have been post quarter end, so that would have not been reflected, so then the mortgage long just go down proportionately up until a point and then RVI can have the proceeds?
Matthew Ostrower: Yeah.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yeah, hi. Quick question on occupancy, it looks like New DDR is trying to get about 93% leased and 90%-91% occupied. I guess when you just think about that portfolio, what do you think the max is, what can the highest occupancy that you can sustain in that portfolio in the highest lease rate, what's going to run out? And then as a secondary question here, as we're thinking about the next few quarters, Matt you talked a little bit about toys and then boxes leasing up, the hhgregg boxes leasing up a little bit later. Can you point us toward what occupancy should be doing in Q2 and Q3, sequentially should we see a little bit of a dip there and then just pick up in the back half of the year?
Matthew Ostrower: Yeah, on your last question, definitely you will see as we feel the toy impact, you will see some impact occupancy. We would expect occupancy to go down to some degree throughout the year as really, really largely over that. And that will be offset to some degree by openings that we have of other stores. But really toys is going to have an impact on the lease rate for sure this year.
Michael Makinen: Mike, with respect to the kind of high water mark for occupancy, this thing to remember that New DDR is down to 80 properties. I mean the amount of focus we can have on 80 property is significant with half the size. It's also a group of assets, it's quite different, some of them are traditional grocery anchor centers and some are traditional large power centers and some are regional and some are semi-regional. We're only focused on creating NAV growth. And so I guess it's going to be a little bit lumpy. It won't be a straight path like you would look at shop occupancy and say well good economic times, I can draw a line from the high 80's and mid-90s. This one's going to be a little bit lumpier. But I personally can't be any reason why the 80 assets left are not a portfolio that can be very, very highly occupied.
Matthew Ostrower: The only mitigating thing I would say that Mike is that as David talk about in his prepared remarks, we are ramping up redevelopments and so there are definitely some spaces that were holding back and will continue to hold back in certain properties to create opportunity there and hopefully improve the cash flows longer term.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we'll speak to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good evening and thanks very much for joining our second quarter earnings call. Over the last several quarters, I’ve repeatedly highlighted three key benefits DDR offers to investors, a return to growth through our strategic transformation, significant near term leasing and redevelopment opportunities and dramatic improvement to our balance sheet. I’ll briefly speak to each of these and then comment on our quarterly results. First, our strategic transformation was clearly the highlight of the quarter with the completion of the spin of RVI. The end product is two distinct companies with two different business plans. RVI will look to realize value through operations and asset sales, leaving DDR with a highly focused portfolio of just 78 wholly-owned assets. DDR’s portfolio was handpicked to maximize property cash flows and to create value for our stakeholders. 2Q earnings provide a sneak peek and DDR’s near-term leasing opportunities as well. We produced a notable pickup in activity highlighted by several new tenants to the portfolio that Mike will discuss later as well as continued progress on the redevelopment front. Finally, completion of the spin combined with our capital markets activities of the last year or so provide DDR with a strong, flexible and competitive balance sheet. As I’ve said previously, we will continue to work to lower leverage. But we will be seeking to do so in ways that are more attractive to investors than slow one-off asset sale especially through capital recycling driven EBITDA growth. Now onto the business of the call. I'll review our results and then provide an update on our recent transaction activity. I’ll then hand the call over to Mike regarding operations and we’ll close with some comments from Matt on the balance sheet and our guidance. Operating FFO in 2Q was $0.03 ahead of our internal expectations, but down sequentially and year-over-year because of dilution from deleveraging. Upside was driven primarily by a slower than expected Toys ""R"" Us liquidation process, lower than expected bad debt expense, early rent commencements from a handful of anchor releases and lower-than-expected G&A costs during the quarter. Operationally, the second quarter demonstrates the high quality of our real estate and sustainable tenant demand, with solid leasing economics and volumes despite our smaller portfolio. Reported same-store NOI growth of 1.4% was as expected lower than the first quarter’s pace, but it was above our internal expectations. Overall, I'm very pleased with our portfolio's performance this quarter. More importantly, recent recapture of empty boxes provides us control of space and parking field at some of our best assets, facilitating several economically attractive redevelopment projects. Our work on building an economically meaningful and attractive redevelopment pipeline continues and we expect to have much more to say on this topic including locations, volumes and expected economics at our upcoming Investor Day on October 9th in New York. Moving on to transactions. Because of activity in the quarter, we've now completed our original $900 million disposition program with a blended cap rate of just over 7.3%. Over the last six quarters, we’ve sold over $2 billion of assets, exploiting both demand for well leased assets and healthy debt markets. Mentioning transactions like the spin or billions of dollars of dispositions on a conference call does run the risk of making these achievements look easy. They are not. And we would not have been able to do it without the help of our world-class legal, transactions and funds management teams. Before handing the call over to Mike, I'd like to close by restating how excited are whole team is with our impending shift from a capital allocation strategy, focused exclusively on deleveraging to one focus on recycling capital and to redevelopment and opportunistic investing. All of which is supported by a curated portfolio of assets with outstanding locations and strong growth profile. The dynamic retail environment in which we find ourselves today certainly provides its share of challenges. But I strongly believe, it increasingly provides opportunities for profit as well, opportunities we at DDR intent to pursue tirelessly. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for some key points on operations.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. I'll start by commenting on leasing volumes and economics and then provide some additional color on same-store NOI growth and capital expenditures. The quarter was the most productive leasing period wed have since joining DDR, and trailing 12-month new lease spreads and new DDR of over 20%, suggest we're not accepting lower rents achieve these results. The new lease has also represented significant enhancement to merchandise mix with several tenants that are new to our portfolio including Floor & Decor Carolina Pavilion in Charlotte, Kroger's specialty Lucky's Market concept, F45 Fitness at Midtown Miami, and a full price Nike store in the lifestyle center at Winter Garden Village in Orlando. We also had several notable rents commencement at this quarter including Dick's the consumer center in West long branch New Jersey and three TJX concepts including Marshall, TJ Maxx and Sierra Trading Post at eastern center in Columbus, Ohio. Such high activity levels quarter-after-quarter simply isn’t possible without seamless interaction between our legal, reasoning and construction teams. And these results demonstrate, we've got an outstanding operations organization. For the second quarter, new DDR saw a 0.6% sequential decline in lease rate compared to March 31, 2018, entirely a result of the rejection of fixed toys and Babies ""R"" locations and the purchase of the Babies ""R"" Us lease at Perimter Pointe in Atlanta for redevelopment. We expect our lease rates trough in the third quarter as a remainder of the toys boxes move through the bankruptcy process. Although, we expect ongoing robust leasing activity to offset some of these headwinds, while the tenant bankruptcy environment has clearly had an impact on our leased rate, we are successfully backfilling at an impressive pace. Switching gears to capital expenditures. We've commenced the comprehensive $9.4 million LED lighting program that will modernize illumination of parking areas at substantially all of our wholly-owned centers. The program will generate both energy and operational savings, improve visibility for our tenants and improve safety for our patrons. Like redevelopment spending, we believe this investment will provide a measurable economic return, but we will nonetheless include these cost in our maintenance CapEx spending disclosure inflating our third quarter and fourth quarter 2018 CapEx numbers. Thanks to our property management team for their help planning and rolling out this initiative, which is the key elements and our overall sustainability and property operations strategy. I am also pleased to announce a partnership we have formed with Raimo that will allow customers to take rides in self-driving vehicles toeing from the Ahwatukee Foothills Towne Center in Phoenix. The venture is already helping us to better understand how evolving transportation technology will affect the design and usage of our centers. Finally, on Toys ""R"" Us of the 12 original stores in the consolidated new DDR portfolio, one has been acquired by a new tenant, one has been acquired by DDR and six were rejected with the remaining four still paying rent. On the JVs one of the five original locations has been rejected and one has been acquired by a new retailer, with the remainder still paying rent at this time. While we do not yet know timing specifics on the remaining leases, we’ve assumed for budgeting purposes that all rent will cease within the next month. We’ve been making significant progress releasing these boxes and I would say that, our pace on this bankruptcy has been faster than in the last several liquidations. The overall leasing environment remains generally unchanged from a year ago. Tenant demand is steady and the quality of new DDR's assets is strong enough that our properties remain sought after by the expanding tenants with whom we do business. Additionally, we continue to see strong small shop leasing volumes and economics, a product of high demand for those spaces and our renewed focus on this inventory in our portfolio. As a result of our efforts, we’ve seen a 50 basis point increase in new DDR shop lease rate since the first quarter. With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matthew Ostrower: Thanks Mike. I’ll start with some comments on the balance sheet then touch on some earnings and accounting matters in the quarter and close with some color on guidance before handing the call back for questions. We continue to target pro rata net debt to EBITDA of roughly six times by the end of 2018, but balance sheet risk is about much more than just overall leverage and we therefore continue to aggressively address our maturity structure. Following our 2017 bond financing and the tender offer associated with the RVI mortgage, new DDR’s pro forma average debt maturity of 6.1 years excluding the RVI mortgage is now among the highest in the peer group. Pro forma for RVI, we’ve only $176 million of debt or less than 10% of debt outstanding maturing prior to 2022. Debt to EBITDA decreased modestly from last quarter, a product of additional asset sales. Like in the first quarter, our second -- secured debt ratio this quarter remained elevated because of the $1.3 billion RVI mortgage loan and associated repayment of unsecured debt. We continue to expect all of our bond and leverage metrics to improve in the back half of the year when RVI and its mortgage are no longer included in DDR’s financials. We expect our secured debt ratio to be less than 5% by year-end. I’d like to now comment on several earnings and accounting matters. First included in our transaction activity disclosure this quarter is an additional $10 million repayment of preferred securities associated with the two Blackstone joint ventures. As a reminder, we established a valuation reserve for these securities in the first quarter of 2017, cutting book value by $76 million to $270 million. Since then, we've achieved key sales threshold levels at both joint ventures, allowing us to receive approximately 50% of equity proceeds from asset sales going forward. We recognize a current 6.5% yield on the preferred securities, so every $1 we get back is the earnings equivalent of an asset sale at a 6.5% cap rate. The Blackstone ventures have just 36 of the 83 original assets remaining as of June 30th with the sales generating total preferred payments -- repayments to us of over $110 million so far. We marked all Blackstone assets to market each quarter, resulting in a $2 million increase in book value this quarter, which follows a variety of small upward and downward marks over the last several quarters. We’re making great progress selling assets, reducing our investment in those joint ventures, and lowering DDR’s leverage as a result. As investors consider our perspective leverage profile, they should consider the gradual receipt of both the outstanding $228 million of Blackstone preferred as well as the $200 million preferred interest DDR retained in RVI. Specifically, we estimate that were these securities to be repaid in full today, new DDR’s debt to EBITDA would decline by roughly half a churn. Second on the earnings front, I would like to point out some ongoing noise associated with non-cash rents caused by tenant bankruptcies. The write-off of fair market value of rents in Q2 primarily associated with the Toys and Babies ""R"" Us liquidation with 3.1 million causing a 4 million decline from last quarter. Finally, on Puerto Rico, we received and recognized a payment of our business interruption insurance of 3.1 million this quarter slightly lower than last quarter. The ongoing low level of BI payments represents evidence of tenant re-openings and rent payment as we continue to recover from the hurricane. In the case of this and prior payments, the payment represents only a portion of the ultimate VI compensation new DDR expect to receive on account of revenues loss prior to the spin of RVI. With the return of normal fee to these assets, we expect these payments to remain at lower levels. Our current estimate of total restoration costs excluding business interruption remains approximately a $150 million consistent with last quarter. Other than repair cost and BI losses incurred by DDR prior to the spin, insurance payments will generally be retained by RVI. We continue to work with our insurer to reach agreement on our final payment amount and settlement. Operations in Puerto Rico continue to stabilize with the 10 basis point sequential increase in lease rate as well as improved the cash receipts. Now a few comments on FFO guidance. First we are pleased with our same-store NOI performance so far this year and are affirming our assumption of at least 1.5% growth for the year, given that were still only at the halfway mark. As Mike mentioned, our same-store NOI projections assumed the rejection of all toys leases within the next month or so. Given the slower pace of Toys “R” Us leased closings, we now expect same-store NOI to trough in the third quarter versus our prior expectations for the second quarter. We are also maintaining our 3Q OFFO guidance of at least $0.30 per share, which includes $5 million of RVI fees. The expected sequential decline in our OFFO from 2Q to 3Q is attributable to the spin of RVI as lost NOI from RVI properties is only partially offset by RVI management fees and lower interest expense. One change from our guidance bridge that we published at nearly relates to RVI fees. Specifically, given their transactional nature, we will exclude RVI disposition fees from OFFO and they are therefore excluded from our OFFO guidance as well. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to have a decline in RVI asset and property management fees resulting from the sale of RVI assets in 2018 should be offset by declines in G&A expense. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Matt, just to follow up on some of your common G&A that you just made, I think that your full year G&A guidance was about 70 million presumably that was excluding the separation charges that you incurred in Q2 which are backed out of OFFO, and understanding that there is some movement in that number relating to the -- what's happening with RVI. But maybe you can provide an update there given that the first half results in prior lower run rates and especially since David I think in your comments you made a comment that G&A in the quarter came in a little bit better than expected?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, I mean on G&A, I would say that our guidance -- you're right, our guidance does not include the kind of the onetime stuff that we exclude from OFFO, so it's a recurring G&A numbers, you are correct on that. I will retain that guidance. It did incorporate the changes we made to staffing and structure recently. So, quarter was a little bit lower. There’s a lot of timing differences in there. So, we’re retaining the guidance. I don’t think you're going to see a huge change in that.
Christy McElroy: And then just for Toys “R” Us, thanks for the slide in there, that’s really helpful. Just should we assume that the seven remaining are in Propco and are all ground leases? And just sort of in terms of from a modeling perspective it would be helpful. What percentage of your original ABR exposure does that comprise? And maybe you can also give us an update on of those original 17 in new DDR? Do you have LOIs I would add any of those?
David Lukes: I think it’s fair to assume the number of boxes opened essentially or roughly percentage share of our total ABR exposure, which is about 1.5% of ABR, deferred to Matt or Mike on the LOI.
Michael Makinen: Christy, this is Mike. Right now as far as LOIs for these, I would describe the activity that we’re seeing on this Toys “R” Us group of leases to be significantly stronger than what we saw with some of the previous liquidations. And for the most part, we’re seeing some level of activity and tenant conversations on the vast majority of them right now.
Matthew Ostrower: And the last thing, it's hard to say just stay not all ground leases to your initial question.
Christy McElroy: In terms of the seven remaining they’re not all ground leases?
Matthew Ostrower: They're actually a mixture.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Can you talk about the lease spread activity and the CapEx associated to it? Obviously, you guys show a pretty healthy lease spreads from new leases, but as I look at CapEx on disclosure, it looks like you paid about $8.70 per square foot compared to a gross rent of 19. So net effective rate of tenants, I know the stuff can around quarter-to-quarter but anymore details you can provide there?
Michael Makinen: This is Mike. I think part of the question you just answered. From quarter-to-quarter, you do have a lot of volatility and bumpiness. This particular quarter, probably two thirds of the leases that we completed were anchor leases and anchor leases by nature are generally going to be considerably more expensive, particularly when you're taking a large space and doing any types of splitting of the space. So, I think it's a function more of just this particular quarter and heavy anchor leasing activity then fundamental trend.
Matthew Ostrower: Just a follow-up here is, one lease in particular this quarter that happened to be more expensive than the others that happens from time to time, but I would say as usual look please-please-please, look at the trailing 12 month numbers as opposed to what’s happening in any given quarter. We don't -- we’re not seeing any change in the economics of what we’re negotiating.
Ki Bin Kim: Just going broader, you touched on it but can you just give us a little sense of how tenant negotiations have evolved over the past year and things tenants are asking for and things that you're giving, if that's changed at all?
Matthew Ostrower: Honestly, I don’t see a huge amount of change in the overall trend of how the leases are structured and the gives and takes. The tenants are aggressive and we’re aggressive as well and for the most part I think the general structure of the leases has not changed dramatically. With the exception of the fact that we are heavily pushing the shop leasing activity and I think in the shop leasing realm, we tend to have a very favorable lease result little bit shorter terms, lower CapEx, and higher rent. But aggregately across the national, change is not a huge difference.
David Lukes: Mike, do you want to speak to the portfolio overall, how that’s changed and potentially changed leasing dynamics since these are your portfolio?
Michael Makinen: Yes, this particular portfolio now that we’ve pruned it and we’re really focused on the -- we consider to be the best real estate. We’re finding the leasing effort and the negotiations so much stronger in our favor and the fact that most of the tenants are looking at an open to buy that is focused on specific locations throughout the country. And the locations that we left in our overall wholly-owned portfolio tend to be great locations that tenants are willing to pay good rents for. Their decisions are based on their top line sales estimate and generally they are seeing top line sales estimates here. So, we have a lot of strength in our negotiating power here.
Ki Bin Kim: So as, how about the time to get a deal done, has that gone better?
Michael Makinen: The time to get a deal done still tends to be -- it tends to be tough. The negotiation process takes a while, but we are finding that the time from the initial conversation to rent commencement has been shortened. But I attribute that less to the lease structure than to our own internal organization and how where -- we've developed a nice streamline program here from the leasing team to the construction team to the property management team and the turnover.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: I want to come back to maybe guidance, I'm sorry if I missed during your prepared remarks. I'm recalling what you said maybe the last earnings call. Can you talk about 2Q being the trough for same-store NOI? So I guess maybe there are some market expectations that you might increase to guide this quarter and given what looks to be a pretty decent print in the quarter relative to what you put out for the first half. I'm just wondering, is this primarily related to the Toys ""R"" Us closure is not coming quite as soon as you were expecting and therefore your sort of being still being conservative in terms of raising the guide?
David Lukes: Yes, I wouldn't read anything into it. I did say in my prepared remarks that we now affect the tough to occur in the third quarter. Obviously, for our budget, we're going to have a bigger hit there now just because of those delays that you referred to. There is nothing particularly insidious. In our guide, we are only half way through the year. We're in a dynamic environment that the headline bankruptcies as I think many people have commented appeared to be abating. But that doesn’t mean you can't have a bunch of paper cuts in the portfolio that extra due in some add up to a material impact. So, there is nothing that we know about we're just trying to be I think careful about that. And the fact that fundamentals are still somewhat uncertain environment out there.
Rich Hill: And just one follow-up. Going back to net effective rent, look I guess if I'm looking at the net effective rent as sort of a percentage of your average rent per square foot. I recognize they can be noisy and even if I'm looking at the trailing 12-month numbers, it looks like it's been -- CapEx has been steadily increasing and so look, number one, I applaud you for providing us that transparency I wish everyone did it. And there is nothing wrong we're saying CapEx is going up, but is it CapEx going up and our tenants requiring more CapEx spend? Are you feeling like you have to put more CapEx in obviously, new DDR's growth story and you have vacancies that can be filled? How we should think about that? And are we supposed to continue to see this sort of trending CapEx going forward?
David Lukes: Yes, Rich I mean I love to compare notes with you. It is not our view that CapEx particularly on a per square foot basis et cetera. The economics, we don’t think are changing materially. We've said have you know we've talk a lot about the fact that our mix of leases has changed. We're doing more anchor deals because of the recent bankruptcies we've had that obviously impacts aggregate CapEx. But we have not seen a material change in the economics. We don't think the trend is negative. So I love to -- as I pointed out I mean for this call, but off line we can compare notes and hopefully we can reassure you that the numbers really aren't not negative the way your analysis is suggesting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Just following up first on the same-store NOI growth in the quarter for new DDR, how much did we longer than expected Toys ""R"" Us liquidation contribute in the quarter? And then can you comment on, how that's bad debt that's trending versus expectations at this point? And what impact that had on the quarter same-store NOI growth and OFFO results?
Matthew Ostrower: I'll take that one. It's Matt. I would just say as I said in my prepared remarks, Toys was part of the outperformance expectations. It was certainly not all of it. I refer to an improvement in bad debt to your question there. We’re definitely seeing the cause of it is, it's probably cyclical who really know, but that is defiantly trending in the right direction. And we also have some faster than expected rent commencement at some of the anchors we have expected to open. So, it was a mixture of things but Toys was certainly a very important factor.
Todd Thomas: Okay and then Matt, you mentioned that one of the changes you need, I guess from the NAREIT presentation that you will be excluding the 1% disposition fee for OFFO going forward. So, the RVI fee income that was lower by $0.04 share so about $7.5 million so I presume that $0.04 difference is an entirely disposition fees. What else is changing their? And thenis there anything else in that OFFO bridge worth noting?
Matthew Ostrower: Todd, just to clarify on RVI fees. So, essentially, it was $0.04 a share of the pick up from the second to the third quarter of NAREIT. We’re now saying it's just $0.03 and difference is entirely attributable to the disposition fee. So, as we guide through start of the year, we talked about $10 million in the back half of the year that’s unchanged. And the differences is from the NAREIT presentation is entirely attributable to disposition fees.
David Lukes: Does that answer your question?
Todd Thomas: Yes, I think it does. I have to take a quick look at those two and reconcile it back to you perhaps. But just one last one then any additional RVI related charges that are yet to be incurred by new DDR as of June 30, and if so, how much is that?
Matthew Ostrower: Some very small item, but nothing that you’re going to notice.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Maybe Matt, can you talk around the potential accounting changes around internal leasing because that can impact FFO in '19? I just want to make sure, it feels like when I look through you supplement I get the sense that the G&A expense already includes, you already expensing some of these line items. Is that correct? So there shouldn't be an impact.
Matthew Ostrower: I’m going to hand that over to our Chief Accounting Officer, Christa Vesy, who spent more time and she cares to on this topic.
Christa Vesy: Sure, hi. Samir. You’re exactly right. I think as everyone knows we actually RV today, expense the majority of those internal leasing cost, and we’re going to factor that into our 2019 guidance. But I would today we’re saying that impact of the change in the capitalization should be relatively small.
Samir Khanal: And I guess my second question is looking at the recovery ratio, it's still a bit in the quarter and had about on my math about 50 basis point on NOI growth. From a modeling perspective, how should we think about that ratio going forward? And kind of what's driving that?
Matthew Ostrower: Like last quarter, we had some movement in the other direction last quarter. I’d just say that it is a variety of different things that cause it, it's very granular. Pleased, I think just look at the trailing 6 or 12 month number on that especially trailing 12 month number, I think you will see that it's been very, very flat. So I’d just kind of use that number as you go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: So just a few questions quick. Matt, on the Blackstone JV, you said there was a positive $2 million revaluation. So one, was that in FFO? And then second, you mentioned about a 6.5% sort of earnings yield. So just curious if you could provide the balance of that's what we should be modeling as far as an income level or for second half yield that you cited with in reference to something other than the P&L impact?
Matthew Ostrower: The evaluation would not be in our FFO that we reported. So that's not part of it. The 6.5% is relates to the balance of our preferred right, that’s really -- we're only a 5% owner in these assets. So that 5% number could move a little bit depending on prices that are sold. But the preferred piece is really the basis for your 6.5%, so the 6.5% cash coupon that we are paid by Blackstone by the joint venture, I should say on our balance. So that number is flat. That’s not really -- the balance will change to some degree based on market pricing. But your 6.5% and the book value we have got today as your best number for using your modeling going forward. There is also I should remind you there is an additional 2% that we received the payment incline which we were no longer recognizing in our GAAP net income. But that number is there and that will change the value of our preferred on the margin over time as well.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then on Toys. So you guys were saying it goes away in third quarter '18. So the full impact if we go from sort of 2Q to 4Q, the total impact on a per earnings basis from Toys going away until obviously that space gets backfilled. How would you quantify that? Is that like a penny of earning, two pennies? So how should we think about that?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, we haven’t boil down specific FFO guidance. I think our view is that you can look at we have provided the table on our slides that give you a very good feel for how much has closed. You calculate a pro rata number based on that and you are not going to be far off.
David Lukes: The only thing I’d add. As Mike alluded to, we've had some pretty substantial leasing activity over the last 6 to 9 months and so you'll see some offset now in both small shop and anchor size.
Alexander Goldfarb: And then just some final questions for David. David, you are through the RVI so that’s behind. But you have also talked about a desire to delever further while obviously you know there is CapEx, there is re-tenanting, better redevelopment that you guys want to do. In your view in your philosophy, do you think that as your focus more than DDR should grow every year, so let's say there's a commitment to grow DDR FFO 6% a year and that’s what's going to be the driver and the other elements, whether it's deleveraging or CapEx et cetera will be model around that? Or is that not the focus? And the reason I ask is, obviously, prior to you guys there DDR for a long had flat lined FFO just as it was trying to improve the balance sheet and recycling get better assets. But FFO kept sort of went nowhere, so just sort of curious now that you're beyond RVI. What should we expect as far as earnings growth? And where that stands in the priority list?
David Lukes: Alex, it’s a great question. It's certainly something we talk about quite a bit here. I will say that by the time we get to the Investor Day conference, we’ll have a more robust discussion and some graphics that will help you all understand how you should think about our strategy going forward. I think for this kind of time period, a couple of weeks after RVI started trading, and a couple of months before our Investor Day conference, we’re really just focused on stability and the safety of the company with great assets. And I do think that our EBITDA will grow, and I think our leverage targets are very reasonable. They’re showing nothing wrong with lower leverage, but for right now, I think we’re heavily focused on recycling. We’re looking at external opportunities, but we really haven't laid out long-term targets for the volume of those opportunities, primarily because they’re opportunistic.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: A couple quick ones from me. First, I guess the question on tenant retention which looks like it’s been at or new all-time high, as you’ve laid about 90% on the same-store, 75% on the total pool. I guess I am curious what you’re -- what do you think of the retention levels here? And how do you think about retention perhaps drifting lower? Or do you think about retention drifting lower over the next couple years?
David Lukes: Well, right now, I think we’ve got pretty stable portfolio in good markets where the tenants are performing well. So that is helping drive the retention level maintenance. And I think in general, there's a lot of times where you see some rise and some fall in some of the shop tenants. But generally I don't see any trend; other than that we’ve got good real estate and as result I think the retention should maintain a pretty high level.
Haendel St. Juste: And then on the dispositions during the second quarter, I am curious just for some incremental color. Were there any portfolio buyers that you noticed have changed in perhaps the composition, the overall demand, any change in the financing? I understand that the financings been there, any incremental perhaps a change on that front?
David Lukes: We really haven’t -- I mean we’ve sold so many assets in a last year and a half, and I would say that everyone has an individual decision. I mean the thing I think you have to remember when looking at our supplemental is that, it’s tempting to want to make macro assumptions about trends. And the reality is, we’ve 78 assets now and those 78 assets have spaces that are at specific intersections and specific townships. And our leasing staff and our redevelopment staff focus on each individual property. It is very hard with the portfolio this concentrated in high income markets with only 78 properties to make kind of sweeping assumptions. I think that’s kind of the one key point that we’ll be dealing with probably for a year or so until folks get used to the fact that our portfolio is much more concentrated.
Haendel St. Juste: And just to clarifying one more, the pool of buyers -- were there any portfolio buyers? Were these one-offs or any sales of any bulk?
David Lukes: They all went off.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brian Hawthorne: When you guys think about funding future investments and you look at kind of raising the capital from dispositions. Do you have to sell anymore consolidated assets? Or would selling the some of these unconsolidated joint ventures be enough?
David Lukes: Everything is unfavorable. It really comes down to what's the opportunity at the time and do we think our shareholders are going to get better value from recycling unconsolidated versus consolidated.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: I have one more question on kind of leasing and retaining CapEx. How much does the kind of total CapEx cost per square foot vary, if your backfilling let's say, Toys are box for the single tenant or if you have to divide the box and kind of into two or three spaces. What's the kind of cost per square foot difference on to those backfilling options?
Michael Makinen: This is Mike. Generally, if you are taking a single tenant and putting in the space versus splitting it into two, you are going to probably see about a 25% increase in the total CapEx necessary to fill that space.
Vince Tibone: Are there any kind of rule of thumb numbers you can provide almost say a 40,000 square foot box in terms of expected landlord work and CIs steps up?
Michael Makinen: It completely depends on the tenants that you are looking at. The difference is really focused on the demising of the space, splitting the utility to store fronts and things like that.
David Lukes: Again, it's really -- I know it would be wonderful to kind of figure out on average what are the differences. I think you can look at individual deals, but the fact the matter I said the type of the building and the age, the column structure, how much power is on the site? Do you have enough clearance? Is there a mezzanine? If you go on and on and on and the difference between putting boxes in Boston versus Kansas is a big labor difference. So it's very hard for us to make kind of sweeping average is on cost. I think as we look at them we're simply looking at our return, and so the rents are different in those markets as well, and depending on where there was a splitting a box to putting it a single tenant in. It really comes down to how much value we think we are creating for our shareholders.
Vince Tibone: And so, my next one is just really overall industry, how do you think the backfilling of Toys is going to differ from a backfilling of sports authority. Are you seeing kind of new tenants to merge or different merchandize categories or the kind of the similar kind of cast of tenants we've seen over the past through years? And then just anymore color you could share on kind of the need or desire to split spaces versus finding single tenant backfills. Do you think any really notable trends on those fronts are different than sports authority in your opinion?
Matthew Ostrower: First of all, the level of interest is higher as far as who is interested. And right now, across our portfolio and much of this is for backfilling Toys ""R"" Us basis, but it also applies to virtually introducing your box space we are looking at. We are actively negotiating deals right now with at least 20 major national healthy companies, ranging from the off price guys like Burlington Ross, the TJX brands, all the way over to specialty grouters like Lucky's, Sprouts. We're doing and having conversations with Publix, Kroger, Home Food, Total Wine, I mean the list is pretty extensive. And all of those are going to be potential candidates and all of those are healthy companies that are growing right now.
David Lukes: Do you want to comment on the splitting dynamics and….
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, generally, when it comes down to a decision as to whether we are going to split space or do a single tenant use. It really comes down to what's going to be the best for that particular center and where we think we are going to get the best economic return. If a tenant is interested in the space and their rent is in particularly attractive versus, if there is two tenants interested in the space and the rent is significantly better than the returns in spite of possibly more CapEx, we're going to choose the latter. And it comes down to the financial decision on the returns of every deal.
Michael Makinen: I would say on the margin, it's still very early days, but I would say that it sounds from the feedback Mike has been giving us. It sounds like there may be fewer splits here than we originally feared, not really to kind of hang our thing yet, but the initial evidence is I'd say enough to its cautionary optimistic.
David Lukes: Defiantly, we’re going to see fewer split as part of the Toys then what we saw part of that is because Babies ""R"" Us is a smaller space. You don't need to split them.
Vince Tibone: One last quick one if you don’t mind, you have to quantify the same-store NOI impact of Toys ""R"" Us between 19 and 20 -- sorry 18 and 19 kind of like do you see the impact now actually being more on 19 then 18 given that the drawn out process?
David Lukes: It's not clear yet to be honest with you. You can see the timing right. I think maybe on the margin to get a little more in 19 depending on exactly how this all plays out, but I think it's still too early to know the answer of that question. I mean the good news is there is quarter from now we will know the answer right like it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Collin Mings: Just going back to your comments on shop leasing, a few quarters ago, you outlined kind of a pre-spend $40 million NOI opportunity associated with leasing up from shop space. Just curious if you think about new DDR and obviously you highlight in lot of comments this part some of the leasing momentum. Just how would you characterize that small shop opportunity going forward?
David Lukes: As far as the overall opportunity going forward with shops, it really comes down the way we focused on it is strictly looking at it from and opportunistic standpoint as to where we can drive rents and drive occupancy with shop leasing. Overall, the growth potential in shop is still a significant number and we would tally that and can get back to where we think right now. But ultimately we think we're striving for being in the low to mid 90% occupancy rate.
Collin Mings: Okay and than just maybe pinpoint out to NOI opportunity -- overall NOI opportunity that I'd be something kind of for the Investor Day that you guys might be able to provide?
Matthew Ostrower: Yes, exactly, we haven’t filled that. Again, we thought we haven’t done that. Obviously, in absolute dollars terms, it has to be smaller. But I think relative to the size of portfolio, I think you actually find potentially a bigger opportunity. So, we will quantify that better for you.
David Lukes: There is no question after the spinoff with a portfolio we have today. If you think of the drivers of small shop occupancy, If you are in wealthier market there is more discretionary income and those people can afford a wider variety of shops right serving their communities. If the anchor tenants are driving high sales and traffic, which means you're more likely to drive more shop demand and the more shops you lease the fewer vacancies are available which means that the demand is for a scarcer amount of inventory. So, I think we feel like curating the portfolio gives us a little bit of fuel, to feel confident that we're getting a lot of traction on the shop leasing.
Collin Mings: Okay got you, just kind of a self reinforcing cycle there on leasing activity.
David Lukes: As long as long as economic forces -- macroeconomic forces are positive which they are. But as you all know, shop occupancy is much more correlated to GDP and employment rate and then boxes are.
Collin Mings: Good point, and than just going back to you guys represented in the prepared remarks and it’s been a couple of questions already on it. But just maybe trying to put a little bit finer points on the comments you guys have gone back to. You're saying that Toys is going better than prior liquidations in the prior question. And in the prior question you've kind of commented on maybe having to divide up the boxes left somewhat that being a box size component to some degree. But just bottom line, what do you think is really driving better demand that turnaround relative to prior liquidations?
Matthew Ostrower: Again, it's the quality of the portfolio is better. The centers that we are attracting tenants to for the vacant Toys space is aggregate, we have a better portfolio and has greater demand from the tenants than the prior situation.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Smith: What are the plans for the dividend at new DDR now that you have been through the spinoff?
David Lukes: It’s a great question Craig. As you can imagine as our board thought about, the proposal from management to execute a spin one of the large conversations was around dividend. As you know the dividend policy is squarely in the decision-making authority of the Board of Directors. I think what we have said on previous calls is that management has made a recommendation, but boards vote on that dividend is not for a little bit.
Craig Smith: I mean is there anything that at least management would like to get in terms of the spread between FFO and the payout for more cash to reinvest?
Matthew Ostrower: I’d just reiterate what we said before on this which is on a full adjusted basis it's at least $0.20 per share. So, you can do your math from there. We did saw materially, materially lower AFFO payout ratio and that’s the recommendation that we intend to make to the board.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: My questions were answered. I’m trying to jump out of the queue. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Cristy. I just had a few questions. Just in terms of the Investor Day and thank you for moving it off of the Jewish Holidays to October. Are you planning in all? I know you want to focus on your strategic priorities the portfolio redevelopment opportunities honing on the 78 assets that you are doing. I guess are you going to plan on doing forward sort of three-year financial plan in terms of cash flow FFO and projected NAV growth in that context?
David Lukes: I think that our goal is to make sure that the investment community is able to think clearly about what our future looks like. And so the components of that will certainly be laid out over a multiyear period. The variable of course is external growth in investment dollars, which is more difficult but I certainly think we can make a pretty credible case we have enough time to dig into the details of every single asset, and with 78 wholly owned assets making up 90% of our NOI. It means that we have got a lot of clarity that our opinion is to what the next few years look like.
Michael Bilerman: So we will get the components but not necessarily per share estimates of the three year plan?
Matthew Ostrower: I don’t want front run things. Michael, you've saw what we did at Equity One on the first time. We were trying to put together a multiyear plan. We need to -- this isn’t just about pretty slides and a nice show. This is about helping you and our investors walk away with a very clear idea of what to expect from DDR's economics going forward, right. If we get to where -- there is some things will definitely deliver on per share basis, some things who will not. We are still formulating everything, but I feel confident that you will walk away feeling like understand like you understand what the cash flow profile this Company will be for the next X years.
Michael Bilerman: And outside of the management team I guess how will the board and specifically auto be involved in the industry today?
David Lukes: Well, the board members are generally enthusiastically asked to attend and act as board members, which is they’re not presentations. I certainly wouldn’t expect that any individual board member would be speaking about his or her shareholdings. It’s a management presentation about what management believes, the strategy is going to result in after having worked with the board for last year and a half.
Matthew Ostrower: But you would expect if you were in our chair you would absolutely preview the sort of thing with the board, you wouldn’t go out there and present things that the board was hearing about for the first time and explicitly getting blessed, so you’re asking about Board interaction ahead of time, you would be right to expect that we wouldn’t be out there with something that we thought they viewed us highly disagreeable.
Michael Bilerman: I was just making sure whether you’ll be providing the opportunity for analysts and investors to interact, and ask questions to the Board, especially as you get new members on not sure where that process stands today and if you can provide an update that would be great, but just sort of those interactions I think given the history and given the changes certainly would be helpful from an interaction perspective, so, I don’t know if you -- if David you want to provide a little bit of color where you stand right now with further changes to the board and additions and things like that?
David Lukes: There’s been a committee that is working under the nominating and corporate governance chair. We have been actively engaged in interviewing candidates for board seats. We’ve gone through skills that each person on board has had a chance to opine about what they think is a great skill set going forward, given what this company looks like. And so far I feel inspired by the number of candidates and the interest in the kind of diversity and the breadth of knowledge that we can bring on to our board, it would be very helpful. So I think the whole board is a little bit energized about the prospect of some fresh blood. Having said that going back to your original question the Investor Day is the management presentation and so I think if there is a desire to have contact with certain directors, I don't believe that the Investor Day is one that we would promote as also being a board interaction.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, that is unfortunately, but I think there is certainly an opportunity to have especially for traveling in for it especially from Germany. Just with a quick question. The 190 million preferred that you’re going to hold at RVI. Matt, how are you going to treat that from balance sheet perspective? I don’t know if you’re just going to mark that at book value, but there is some other valuation methodology we should be thinking about?
Matthew Ostrower: No, it's very cost basis, so there’s no funding business there.
Michael Bilerman: So it's just 190 will be on your balance sheet?
Matthew Ostrower: Correct.
Michael Bilerman: And then lastly just on the Vimeo venture with the Walmart centers in Phoenix. Can you give a little bit more color how that came about? Was it your Walmart relationship? Was it some outreach that you had with Vimeo? How did your involvement come about relative to other potential landlords in Phoenix?
David Lukes: We’re not involved with Walmart, it is basically just two separate relationships. There is Vimeo-Walmart relationship and then there’s a Vimeo-DDR relationship. Vimeo effectively is based in Chandler, Arizona and Ahwatukee Foothills shopping centers there. And our SVP of IT has a relationship with Google and ultimately was able to set up and build a relationship with Vimeo and we were able to strike this arrangement.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we look forward to next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

For those of you on the phone who would like to follow along during today's presentation please visit the events section of our Investor Relations page and sign into the earnings webcast. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good evening and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by thanking those of you who attended our recent Investor Day. At that event we presented a five-year plan to deliver average annual OFFO and NAV growth of 5%. We expect this growth to originate from three sources. First and by far the most impactful is our plan to generate an average 2.75% annual same-store NOI growth, a large portion of which is from releasing the 60 anchor opportunities within our portfolio. Second, we expect to generate returns of 8% on redevelopment capital spend over the coming five years. And finally, we expect to accretively reinvest an average $75 million annually on acquisitions of properties with significant growth and return upside. Nearly everything we do as a company can be framed by this three-pronged approach and we made significant advancements on each during the third quarter. On the operating side, we posted same-store NOI growth of 2.2% which was ahead of our budget and a product in part of rent commencements from a variety of anchor leases offset by lost NOI from bankruptcies. Michael will discuss leasing activity in a moment, but I'll summarize by saying that we had a very strong active quarter with compelling economics, the key leading indicator for future NOI growth. Our budget for 2019 and beyond assumes additional tenant bankruptcies, but this should not obscure the fact that demand for space in our portfolio of dominant assets in wealthy communities remains robust. We also advanced our redevelopment pipeline during the quarter. We delivered the initial phase of the West Bay project in Cleveland earlier than expected and ahead of budget. And we signed leases with key anchors including Lucky supermarket, which will be replacing our last remaining Kmart location as part of our Brand and Boulevard redevelopment project. We continue to make progress on the latter phases of our pipeline as well. Commencement of each of these projects depends on three variables, tenant demand, tenant approvals and entitlements. At the Investor Day, we highlighted that these extremely well-located assets have significant demand from a number of potential users including grocers, office tenants, hotels and multi-family. And we have recently recaptured enough space to address these tenant approval piece. What remains then is entitlement. And that's where we're spending time. We expect to be in front of a large number of the municipalities in the next several quarters and we'll provide updates on our progress as we move through the required entitlement process. I'm also pleased to announce, the first two deals in the opportunistic portion of our business plan with the planned purchase of two assets from our joint venture program, Melbourne Square and Sharon Greens for a combined $20 million. You should expect our recycling focused acquisition program to involve diversity as it relates to retail format, geography and tenant roster. But all will share certain key characteristics, the ability to achieve an attractive cap rate, significant cash flow growth through the application of our superior redevelopment and leasing expertise and valuable locations protected from near-term supply and enhanced by large local spending power. Our first two acquisitions share some additional characteristics. They're both grocery anchored. They have significant near-term leasing and tactical redevelopment upside and they demonstrate the quality and the strength of the assets in our JV programs as well as the potential for those programs to provide acquisition opportunities going forward. We have come a long way in just 18 months, but we remain focused on sourcing opportunities to quickly and meaningfully unlock value, demonstrate the quality of our real estate and improve our capital position. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike for some commentary on our operations.
Mike Makinen: Thank you, David. This quarter was extremely productive from a leasing perspective with ongoing high leasing volumes. Additionally, we signed four more vacant anchors since the Investor Day including leases with Total Wine and Sierra Trading Post. Notable deals this quarter include ULTA at Buena Park near Los Angeles, which caps off the retenanting of the Toys Box there and CGV cinemas at Van Ness in downtown San Francisco where we are conducting what is effectively a gov renovation of an historic property with an exciting high credit operator at a significantly higher rent. These leases are all accompanied by strong mark-to-market with new lease spreads in the third quarter over 20%, renewal spreads over 8% and combined spreads of roughly 9% right in line with our historical average. Another key measure of economics net effective rents was similarly in line with our strong trailing 12 month numbers. We are clearly getting a lot of space leased and with compelling returns in the process. Many of these new leases represent enhancements to our merchandise mix. This quarter, the highlight was the earlier than expected opening of West Bay and its new lineup including Fresh Thyme, HomeSense and ULTA among others. We've also commenced the comprehensive $8 million LED program I mentioned last quarter. The program will modernize the illumination of parking areas at our centers and generate both energy and operational savings and improve visibility for our tenants and safety for our patrons. I would encourage you to view page 7 of our earnings slides for some before and after photos of Shopper's World. Finally on Toys R Us, six of the 12 original stores in the consolidated SITE portfolio were acquired. Two by SITE for redevelopment of Perimeter Point and Shoppers World, of the remaining six stores, two are leased or at lease and we are negotiating LOIs for the remaining four stores. In short, we have identified a tenant or tenants for every single Toys R Us box and are in a better position today compared to the bankruptcy's from the last several years. It's a credit to our leasing operations teams as well as a testament to the quality of the real estate in our portfolio. There will be downtime and drag on same-store NOI in 2019, but we are really encouraged by our prospects for these spaces. Overall, tenant demand across our portfolio is steady and the quality of SITE's assets in the top quartile of the country's retail landscape mean tenants want to do business with us. With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thanks Mike. Our balance sheet remains well-positioned and we continue to expect leverage to fall as final remaining asset sales are completed and preferred capital in a Blackstone joint venture and from RVI is repaid. Full payment of these two securities would cost almost a full term decline in our reported adjusted EBITDA. Our weighted average maturity of roughly 6 years is in line with last quarter and remains one of the highest in our sector. As David said, while we are focused on growth, we are equally focused on finding ways to unlock and demonstrate value from a capital perspective. I'd like to now comment on several earnings and accounting matters. First, we introduced 2019 FFO guidance of $1.15 to $1.20 at our Investor Day on October 9. In that guidance as well as the assumptions behind it remained unchanged. We also disclosed the underlying details and assumptions at that time. In particular the expectation the decisions and transactions from 2017 and 2018 would impact 2019. As most of you know Blackstone continues to unwind its joint venture with us and that as well as selective asset sales in our other JVs will cause a decline in JV fees in 2019. We expect 2019 to be the trough year for JV profitability especially as we consider utilizing JV capital to unlock value and offset our current high cost of equities. A second headwind to 2019 result will come from the full year impact of 2018 asset sales and 2018 bankruptcies. In the third quarter, we had approximately $600,000 of combined income from Toys R Us and Mattress firm spaces that have since closed or that we expect to be rejected. And finally, we have flagged the impact of Van Ness which is our only redevelopment project whose dilutive impact was not already felt in 2018 NOI. The existing operator will vacate in January and we expect CGV to open in January of 2020. As we said at Investor Day, beyond this project there is no remaining NOI slated to come off line in order to facilitate our redevelopment program. You will note that our 2019 G&A guidance has been lowered by $7 million in order to reflect the reclassification of some expenses from G&A to operating expenses in an attempt to make our income statement more closely reflect industrywide classification practices. This is a change in geography only and therefore has no impact on EBITDA, GAAP net income, FFO, OFFO or same-store NOI. In the third quarter NOI and G&A were $1.7 million lower as detailed on Slide 10 in our earnings deck. Staying on the topic of G&A, our guidance [calls] [ph] RVI fees flat for 2019 effectively assuming no RVI asset sales. We do in fact expect that RVI will sell additional properties and that fees will decline as a result. While we expect a one for one offset between RVI fee declines and lower G&A in 2019, this relationship will almost certainly shift in 2020. We would expect some headwind to 2020 FFO from ongoing RVI liquidation until the RVI preferred is repaid and redeployed. On the joint venture front, you will see in our transaction disclosure that we received an additional $22 million repayment of preferred securities associated with the Blackstone JV, which brings our total receipt of preferred repayment to over $130 million with the remaining balance net of evaluation reserve of $204 million. As a reminder, we established the valuation reserve for these securities in the first quarter of 2017 cutting book value by $76 million to $270 million. Since then we have achieved key asset sales threshold levels in the Blackstone three joint ventures allowing us to receive approximately 50% of equity proceeds from asset sales going forward. We recognize the current 6.5% yield on the preferred securities, so every dollar we get back of the earnings equivalent of an asset sale at a 6.5% cap rate. Blackstone ventures have just 25 of the 83 original assets remaining as of September 30 and we mark all Blackstone assets to market each quarter to determine the reserve resulting in a $2 million decrease in book value in 3Q, which follows a variety of small upward and downward marks over the last several quarters. We're making great progress selling assets, reducing our investment in those JVs and lowering SITE leverage resulting in a more focused portfolio of assets that are easier to underwrite. Switching to the consolidated financial statements. We recognize $1.8 million of business interruption income related to RVI Puerto Rico assets in the quarter. This consisted of BI pertaining to period prior to the spin, but paid to site centers by RBI after the spin. Finally please note that $14 million of the total $20 million of impairments we recognized in the period was related to the RBI assets immediately prior to the spin rather than assets owned by SITE Centers today. With that, I will hand the call back to David for some closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. Our new company brand is a reflection of the fact that our SITE's are at the center of communities. We are enthusiastic about the real estate about our team and about our internal growth drivers and the opportunities that we know will fuel our external growth. We'd be happy to answer questions and I'll turn the line back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. So how should we think about the cadence of same-store NOI over the next year? You have a few moving pieces. You have some NOI deal, if I lose from -- towards those boxes, I will go dark. And then, you have a lot leases that you have accomplished on your anchor spaces. So just think about how that should run in 2019?
David Lukes: Hi, Ki Bin. Thanks for your question. I would say that I would generally call it more back end loaded, back half loaded. It's not a huge difference but there is some kind of favorability in the back half.
Ki Bin Kim: Oh, sorry, I thought that was cut off. And just one quick question on CapEx. It seems like you're still running a little bit higher than your historical trends. CapEx spent of about 30% and the percent of rental value. Is this because a mix was heavier towards smaller spaces this quarter and how should we think about this into 2019?
Matt Ostrower: Well, I would say CapEx in the quarter was a little bit lower the way we measure it. We have a smaller portfolio now. So you're going to see that number bounce around quite a lot. As we outlined in the Investor Day, we have a lot of anchor leasing to do, so that's obviously going to raise the CapEx numbers for a time period. But I would say you should really be looking at kind of trailing 12-month numbers when you evaluate that.
Ki Bin Kim: All right. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hey everyone. Good evening. Just a follow-up on that last question from Ki Bin. Just on the CapEx, I think you said it was going to be higher in 2019. And I point to the two anchor boxes, the proactive termination of the 222,000 square feet. You talk about the 260% releasing spreads in the presentation. But as you work to retenant larger boxes like that assuming you're going to have to break up those boxes right so that, it requires a lot of CapEx. So I guess, the two questions are what is that 260% on a net effective basis and how should we think about sort of a clean CapEx run rate for 2019?
David Lukes: Yes. I mean I would say that generally, so I'm not saying that the CapEx numbers are going up dramatically from here, let's be very clear about that, right. We've had a high level of anchor leasing that we've been doing and so those CapEx numbers, I would say in the past 12 months have been relatively inflated. And I think you can expect we've been saying I think for several quarters now, you can expect as long as we're doing a lot of anchor leasing you're going to see those CapEx ex-number stay at the kind of higher level they've been over the last 12 months. I don't think they go up dramatically from here. We have a number of onetime items right. So we talk about the LED program that's going to artificially, I would say inflate the number a little bit in the short-term. But I don't think, you're going to see this sustainably much higher trend than where we sit today.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then…
Matt Ostrower: Examples that David talked a little bit about our Investor Day about the Kmart shopping center. That's one of the boxes and David, I am not [indiscernible] on this as well.
Christy McElroy: And just with regard to the RVI fees, the $7.2 million in third quarter excluding the disposition fees and that's obviously consistent with the guidance that you provided for 2019. I'm wondering how did you get from the original sort of estimation of at least $5 million why is it, what sort of raised the fee load from what was originally estimated to be? And then, Matt also you mentioned in your discussion on G&A that headwind in 2020 where it wouldn't move in lockstep. Can you maybe provide a little more color as to why that would be?
Matt Ostrower: Sure. So on your first question, I want to remind you that our guidance was for at least $5 million. So we weren't kind of targeting $5 million number that was the number we had absolute visibility on. You pointed out disposition fees obviously those come in as transactions happen and we did not want to forecast those specifically. We also get leasing commissions for example which we did not provide specifically in our guidance because those are to some degree transactional in nature as well. And can you remind me, the second part of your question Christy, I'm sorry, I forgot.
Christy McElroy: Yes, sure. You mentioned in your, I guess it was in an answer to your question in your prepared remarks about how the D&A decline in the RVI fee decline would move in lockstep in 2019. But then, there was a headwind in 2020 that would keep that from happening. I was just wondering why that is.
Matt Ostrower: Yes. Look there is a -- we can cut G&A for a time period, right and we have cut G&A very significantly already. So we can kind of match those declines over time. But there is a limit. At some point we can't completely cut all the G&A that we're losing in terms of RVI fees will definitely be -- as we model that out and we get more clarity on that. We'll be providing that too as well. There'll be good things happening in 2020 as well. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that's just a massive negative for the year, but it's something for you to be thinking about as you are doing your modeling as well.
Christy McElroy: Is there a way that we should be thinking about sort of an ongoing like a target G&A as the RVI management agreement winds down?
Matt Ostrower: Yes. It's just a little bit too early for us to give you specific guidance on that Christy. So like I said, if we go through the year we'll be giving you more specificity there as we get more clarity on ourselves.
Christy McElroy: All right. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi thanks. Good afternoon. First question, I think you were expecting a softer third quarter in terms of same-store NOI growth and it came in considerably better than the second quarter. What was the impact from continuing to receive rent from Toys R Us and what were some of the other drivers of the [beat] [ph] there versus your expectations?
David Lukes: Todd, I'll hand it over to Matt in a second. But, I think I'd like to preface by saying that when you slim down a portfolio to less than 80 properties you need to start expecting that our numbers are lumpy. And we still got a quarter left. We have a recent bankruptcy in the near past that we're working through with Mattress firm. So there's enough uncertainty that although we definitely have been ahead of budget there are some headwinds on the other side too that we're just being cognizant enough. So Matt can give you a little more detail but for right now we feel pretty comfortable leaving our objective the same by the end of the year.
Matt Ostrower: Yes. I think to David's point about lumpiness, we did have some favorability from earlier RVI fees and expected et cetera. And then, we had some onetime payments that came through as happens every year and really every quarter. And those numbers helped to make the third quarter a stronger number.
Todd Thomas: Okay. I think I may have missed some of the detail on Toys, but are they all empty at this point, do you have control of all of the boxes and have you received October rent from any of them?
David Lukes: Remember, Toys is a very interesting case study for this company for the SITE Centers portfolio because there were 12 boxes that are in our wholly-owned portfolio. Four of them were assumed and therefore they never stopped paying rent. Two of them, we purposely are holding vacant for redevelopment plans and you can see that in Framingham up at Shopper's World down in Perimeter Point. And then there are six that we're leasing. And Mike can give some detail behind the leasing progress. But suffice to say it's extremely promising.
Mike Makinen: Right. Of the six that we're working on, one is fully leased in Buena Park, California. One, we're out lease and the remaining four were in active stages of negotiating [on LOIs] [ph]. And it's been very, very active demand for all of them.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then, just last question here, you've noted that the company has no remaining direct exposure to Sears or Kmart. But, I was just curious how you think about some of the indirect exposure your centers have either being located near major malls or near Kmart boxes where there might be some vacancies arising. What are you seeing potentially there as you think ahead.
David Lukes: It's a very, very prescient question. I mean I think all of us for years now have been thinking about what happens when this inventory comes back to the market. Since it's no surprise you can imagine us curating a portfolio down to what we think are dominant assets. We ended up with properties that are buried in very wealthy communities. Rarely does that include a Sears or Kmart. They tend to be a bit more mid-market. The majority of what's left is I think going to be impacted immediately surrounding mall inventory And if you recall, one of the things I said earlier when we look at properties and their future, we tend to think about how much tenant demand is there. How much two tenants control our future, in other words their lease restrictions, and then, lastly the municipal entitlement. It's different for mall assets. And mall assets there is reciprocal easement agreements and there's usually a zoning that's specifically written for that mall asset. And so the red tape to get through changes to a mall are definitely more complicated than a traditional one story strip center. Then you layer on top of that that many of the Sears buildings are two stories with multiple loading docks and different column grids. And so it's just a different business than repositioning junior boxes in an open air format. So I would say that we're pretty confident with the SITE Centers portfolio that the impact of this kind of shadow inventory showing up is pretty de minimis.
Mike Ostrower: I would add Todd is, I will show you a report on the topic, which I thought was very helpful. And as you noted in that report really and you can kind of [indiscernible] things down more. But in terms of proximity there's a very small portion of our portfolio that's really proximate to any locations anyways. So you start taking fractions of fractions of fractions and it's just, I don't think it's a huge exposure. And I just wanted to come back, we didn't answer your question directly about Sears -- about Toys R Us paying rent. Just to be clear they are all now at -- they are all now at, right. So we were getting rent any of those boxes today because they assume the lease.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Good evening. I was hoping to get a private market update and specifically for power centers versus grocery anchored centers as you go through RVI sales?
David Lukes: Hi, Derek. It's a useful question. I would say that for the purposes of our company now, we're pretty small focused company now and so I think our transactions are not a great proxy for the industry as a whole. If you want to see what's happening on RVI, I would encourage you to read the press releases that come out from RVI and look at the disclosure there as to what's selling and you can kind of figure out the volumes. But for our company, we've sold nothing in the last quarter and so we can't really give you a whole lot of current information that's -- it's macro.
Derek Johnston: Okay. Well, how about then an update on some type of leasing demand and sentiment, we are heading towards the holiday season. Have you seen any positive movements head of retailers and especially in light of Amazon's 15 hour per wage increase. Any color there that you could share?
David Lukes: I'm trying to think of color that would be noteworthy to you. But within our portfolio, if you look at the volume of leasing we've got on this last quarter compared to a couple of years ago, you'll see that the volumes are very high and the active retailers that are signing leases are very, very active. One of the challenges of course is finding contractors and enough labor pools to get the TIs built out and get these tenants open. So that has always been a challenge in our business. But it's more so when you have a low unemployment rate because the properties are very active. Mike, I don't know, if you have anything to add?
Mike Makinen: The only other thing I would add to that is that you need to keep in mind that we've carefully pruned this portfolio so that we have what we feel is a very high demand set of properties and that's driving the leasing demand as well.
Derek Johnston: Understood and thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good evening. So just, yes, two questions here first just big picture Matt or David you guys had the Investor Day a few weeks ago. You've been pretty consistent on the guidance for the third quarter of at least $0.30, you came in $0.33, great 10% bp. But as we look about the guidance for next year 115 to 120, RVI is going to continue to sell assets you're going to have leasing fees. So presumably the RVI fee income is going to be better. You've already had sort of impact of bankruptcies and stuff and next year you get some benefit of backfilling. So why is 115 to 120, the right guidance range versus if you take the $0.33 run rate, you're already north of a $1.30. So if we look at where the street was ahead of that investor day was 123. So why -- what gets you guys to that guidance range for next year and why want to be higher just based on what this quarter seems to be a lot of normal moving pieces of your business?
David Lukes: All right. It's a great question. Let me give a little set-up and then I'll hand it up to Matt. The purpose of the Investor Day Conference is to explain to people what our long-term vision is expose how we as a company look at real estate, what we think we can do with that, and then, of course, what the results are. And the results that we proposed were 5% NAV growth, 5% OFFO growth. And I think a pretty compelling stable two and three quarter percent seems to NOI growth. Buried within those are various assumptions and as you can imagine it's not a straight line. So I personally feel confident of the longer term goal. And I think that one quarter at a time or two quarters at a time is less relevant if you're trying to match from the 4Q this year through next year. Matt and Connor can help you probably more individually with some modeling questions, but conceptually speaking, it's a company that's still in change.
Matt Ostrower: Right. I mean, I would point a few things, right. One is RVI, mentioned RVI fees going up next year. That's really not possible, right, particularly the OFFO fees that we are recognizing because the fees will go down as we sell RVI assets and as I'm sure, you have seen we are selling RVI assets, those fees will decline even though -- our guidance assumes that [indiscernible] predict transactions. And then, point you back to the very same disclosure we provided at Investor Day. We're trying to make this as user friendly as possible, if you do your model. We have a variety of headwinds, right. We continue to unwind the Blackstone JV, you commented on that on a number of occasions in your notes, the fees from that are going to be a headwind next year we expect JV fee to be troughing next year, but that is a significant headwind. We are refilling anchor boxes but as I'm sure you're aware tenants continue to declare bankruptcy as we saw with Mattress firm. So we have Toys now, we have Mattress firm that will be a headwind. And then, we pointed out specific $0.02 hit from our one remaining dilutive redevelopment which is Van Ness. So I think when you add up all that stuff together it should make it pretty straightforward as to why we might have a lower FFO number next year.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. That's helpful Matt. And then, the second question is, just as you guys think about bring in joint venture partners. For the alternative uses where you'd be bringing them in. How do you weigh sort of an operating joint venture an outright sale of that pad to the joint venture partner versus a ground lease to try and retain some long-term ownership in case the person who ends up undertaking the venture doesn't perform in a way that you want, so that that way you still have rights to it and you can reclaim that. How do you weigh those three different options as you look at -- as you look at bringing in a JV and densifying some of your projects?
David Lukes: Well, certainly we're going to have to deal with that issue in a year's time because we're going to get into completing entitlements in '19 with properties that have other asset classes and so you will see us wrestle with that. It's certainly number one a financial exercise as to which one has the highest risk adjusted return as you know some asset classes can pay a lot in a ground lease and some cannot. As far as doing joint ventures there is a land contribution model, there's a variety of ways that we can figure out how to do it. But I would say number one it's financial and then number two is, you're suggesting there is -- there's kind of a social aspect with your own property if you're subdividing pieces and you're creating land value. Is there a benefit, or fringe benefit to the remaining retail to have some control over those pieces, or are the pieces simply disparate enough that it doesn't have an impact. And so I would agree with you that's an equally important point to consider in addition to the financial and that is the interaction with the other components on the SITE. For right now, we simply are trying to build the optionality. We've gone through a variety of projects at Investor Day, we proved that we've already taken the NOI dilution from taking boxes and certain pads and shops off line. And so I think we're sitting with --at those properties trough NOI, we're going to entitlements and at some point in the next year or two, we'll be able to figure out how it's best to monetize especially in light of what you're seeing with our other asset classes. So we'll see. We just right now want to build the optionality and that's what we're focused on.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hi, guys. Can you help me understand the difference in or what's driving the difference between the total portfolio occupancy on a pro-rata basis, it was about a 100 were down -- about 110 basis points year-over-year and the same-store, physical occupancy which is about 50 basis points. So, why are they -- just can you help me understand what's driving that disconnect?
David Lukes: Off the top of my head, I would say that is largely a couple of projects in the redevelopment pipeline. Specifically [indiscernible] collection at Brandon Boulevard, but I can come back and let me give you some more detail. I will come back to you on that.
Matt Ostrower: Vince on Christy's question from earlier, so Kmart we bought back that lease last quarter and David talked about that in Investor Day. That was a couple of hundred thousand square feet alone on that front. Okay. Just to clarify, so the two Toys boxes that are being held for redevelopment those are not included in the same-store pool or the same-store figures this quarter.
David Lukes: Those are being held is why they're not in the quarter being helped specifically from development.
Vince Tibone: Got it. Does that have a material impact on -- just reported figures of those were included in the pool. With that I mean I'm just trying to get a sense of the 10 basis point impact like a 50 bps impact, if those were included?
David Lukes: I'm thinking, you'll have to come back to a specific answer.
Vince Tibone: Okay. No problem. That's helpful. And then, just one more for me, is there any more insights you can share on the Mattress firm bankruptcy the timing and closure, then the impact it will have on site since NOI.
Mike Makinen: Yes. This is Mike. Basically we've got 24 stores in our wholly-owned portfolio right now six of those have been rejected. And we're waiting to see the fate of the rest. The one thing I will say it's important to note that a lot of these leases regardless of what happens from a big picture standpoint, a lot of these leases are below market and for the most part the spaces tend to be an excellent location within the Center. So, we feel pretty confident, that given our small shot efforts that we've really undertaken lately, it fits nicely into our accelerated small shop program and we'll see what happens.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Thank you. That's all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Yes. Good evening guys. I want to start-off with just a CapEx question. There were some focus last quarter about some numbers showing CapEx went up, it went down this quarter. But separate from what you're reporting, I'm wondering are you starting to see any changes in CapEx given your rising labor costs or your rising raw material construction costs, and how are you thinking about that?
David Lukes: Rich, it's something that we have been trying to track pretty carefully. We have an estimating department that has a great job of figuring out how much it is to split box or a vanilla shell boxes. And to-date there have been cost escalations in the labor portion, but the Labor portion of the total GMP contract is not an outsized portion and so we just haven't seen enough inflation in construction costs to make a difference on the overall economic viability of retenating boxes. I mean it's been very small. It's not to say that, if we see, raw materials go up and that might change a little bit. But the reality is that rising labor and rising materials usually affects businesses that have much more expensive build out in strip center construction is so cheap. That it generally doesn't have as much of an impact.
Rich Hill: Helpful. Going back to maybe some of the comments talking about retailers, could you comment on maybe not -- love you to comment on specific retailers on your watch list, I doubt you'll do that. But can you talk to -- can you maybe give general views about how your watch list is evolving. Is it broader, or is it a fewer number of retailers, how has it changed over the past maybe quarter and year-over-year?
David Lukes: You mean in the last couple of quarters, I don't think any of us around this table here would say that the names that are on the list are changing a whole lot. What's different of course is that our portfolio is a lot smaller as of June. And a smaller portfolio means that we're most likely happier to get those spaces back then we were unhappy maybe a year ago. So I don't know, if we've really seen a whole lot of change in makeup, but we certainly I think better prepared because the portfolio is smaller and we have a pretty good idea of which space is going to be back. I mean as an example, Mattress firm with the numbers that they've come out with, we looked through the list and you'll remember at Investor Day I presented a project in Edgewater New Jersey there's a Whole Foods doing more than $50 million in gross sales and surprise, surprise there is a Mattress firm on that site. That's an example where we're probably 20% to 25% below market in that space and there's a number of them in the portfolio that are like that. So Midtown Miami, Perimeter Point in Atlanta. So we've got a great portfolio I think to respond to this kind of continued disruption.
Mike Makinen: And Rich, I would just point you back to you at Investor Day and we kind of showed you some analysis of, how did in recent bankruptcies in this portfolio, right. And so what we said to you and to the Investor base repeatedly is that, we can't completely control once portfolio exactly who our tenants are but we have control for it is what happens when we get the space back. And with those example showed, is that at the low-end, we got Toys at a full 20% spread. And some of the other sports authority and Golfsmith were 30% to 40% percent range. So when we get, if we still have some what those exposure that hasn't changed dramatically when we get space back, we're going to get those spread on these basis.
Rich Hill: Okay. Thanks guys. If I have any more questions, I will follow-up offline. Thanks guys.
David Lukes: Thanks Rich.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. So as you release some of these anchor boxes that seemingly pretty good spreads. Is there an element of lost square footage because there might be some cases where you split up the box and put two junior anchors in one bigger space. So while the rent per square foot increases, is there a chance that is of a smaller net square footage?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, can I ask you a question?
Ki Bin Kim: Sure.
David Lukes: What's the definition of seemingly?
Ki Bin Kim: It means definitely.
David Lukes: It depends on the boxes, the toys boxes in general when we leave them to a single tenant, they generally take the whole space. And by generally I mean, I can't think of any that didn't. When we split a box, there's usually a small portion that's left over, but it's a pretty small number. What I think you're talking about is that different strategy which is you convert a box to a line of shops and therefore the depth can only be 90 feet not 180. And that and that is a different type of business and I think you know we also have been aggressive on trying to find those opportunities and I think a year and a half ago, we had hope that there would be more. The reality is, there's been so much junior box demand to fill the Toys R Us and Sports Authorities that we have done relatively little mothballing of space. And so the total square footage that we're leasing is darn close to the gross square footage that Toys had before.
Mike Makinen: Just to underscore, having done that analysis, around the historical analysis that is not going to be totally clear change in JLA is not remotely a driver of those spreads.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And that's the same for the 60% of leases that are dressed for your anchor boxes in the pipeline?
Mike Makinen: Yes.
Ki Bin Kim: All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yes. Can you hear me?
David Lukes: Yes. We can hear you.
Mike Mueller: Oh, great. I was wondering on the comments that JV fee income should be troughing in 2019. Should we read into that that it's just a statement about the 2 Blackstone JVs going away next year or could it be that you intend on expanding that business as an offset elsewhere? So we see more JVs pop up?
Matt Ostrower: Well, I think what we're saying is that, we would hope that it troughs in '19 and hope comes from two categories. One is that, if we continue to be successful of selling RVI assets, which is the business plan of that company and the markets are still open and proving that the cap rates are attractive to sell. We will be kind of working ourselves out of a job. At the same time there are lots of capital partners that would like to partner with us. And I think it is likely that we will remain positive on the business of joint ventures. And so I think you'll see just us recycle different partners throughout an economic cycle and keep our scale big enough that we can find opportunities within those portfolios.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good evening, everybody. Just a couple of detailed questions. On the RVI fees that are included in the Operating FFO. Matt can you give me a sense as to what is sort of the base asset management fee versus the lease income fee. I'm just trying to understand how big the two pieces are relative to each other.
Matt Ostrower: We've not given the disclosure on the individual fees and dollar amounts, Chris. We did in the Form 10, I will give you the percentages, right. So you can kind of back into that if you want to: 50 basis point asset management and generally speaking, 3 or so percent on property management.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then, on the G&A presentation change, so that the when we talk about guidance going from $70 million of G&A to $63 million, I'm assuming that $7 million shifts in the operating expenses, is a clean move, there is no…
Matt Ostrower: Correct.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then, the last question for me is, just on that G&A guidance for next year that also fully incorporates whatever lease accounting change impact there might have been to the company?
Matt Ostrower: Correct.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Matt Ostrower: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is a follow-up from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So first congratulates, two new people to your Board. I think that's great. And then, I had a question -- a couple of questions. First, is just on a definitional between what you consider redevelopment versus what you consider retenating. So if you look at like Van Ness you're replacing the box with the cinema. Why would that be a redevelopment versus a retenant, so where does it cross the line from one to the other?
Mike Makinen: Yes. I mean that it looked, as you know, I'm sure you have seen looking at all these companies there are some properties that are kind of in a gray area. Then, we are not moving external wall because it's a historical structure. We are doing absolutely everything else you could possibly do to a building without moving a wall. This is probably removing floors. So the project seems so large scale and so impactful that we used at very much sitting in the spirit of redevelopment. But we've also given you the dollar amount, right, that you can kind of do your math there if you want to.
Michael Bilerman: So it's where substantial capital would be involved even if it [indiscernible]?
Mike Makinen: It's a reform. I mean it really is a reformatting, right. I mean if we live, if you say must move an external wall to call, I think redevelopment, then I guess, it's not.
David Lukes: [Indiscernible] renovation.
Mike Makinen: Yes. I mean this is -- the building is changing very, very significantly, it felt very much in spirit of all that [indiscernible]. We've given you enough discloser that you can kind of -- if you want to figure out the impact, you can more than looking through that.
Michael Bilerman: And just thinking about RVI in terms of the disclosure you're going to provide as external managers for that entity. I guess will you be hosting a separate conference call when you report results for them or not?
David Lukes: We will not. We will be press releasing whenever we sell assets and we'll be filing our quarterly results.
Michael Bilerman: So should we be using this call as RVI as one component of your performance and from a fee income perspective, asking questions about that?
David Lukes: Mike, so I think that to suggest that you're going to be covering RVI now.
Michael Bilerman: No. I'm saying both RVI is a -- there is income that flows into DDR, right, you had $7 million of fees income, but it came in. And you're getting disposition fees clearly RVI is a component of your cash flow earning stream as that entity evolves. But, it's not…
David Lukes: I mean the factor of the matter is that, the business plan for RVI is fairly well stated that it is, its goal is to dispose of properties and arbitrage between what I think is a pretty healthy private market for dispositions. Since the business plan is stated there's only really one aspect left and that is the pace at which those assets are sold and the rate. The pace at which they're sold, you're right does have a reflection on how many fees or how much we get in fees every quarter. So you certainly could use the RVI press releases as they come out to note how many square feet what percentage of the assets are going away. But I don't see us talking about the business plan or projecting our thoughts as to how fast and how soon.
Matt Ostrower: The spirit of this -- to be totally clear is that, we are not going to be in the business of making a lot of forward-looking statements in RVI, where is not a true operating businesses, it's not about same-store NOI growth and leasing spreads and everything else. You're right technically some of those numbers could have a very, very small spillover effect onto -- on the SITE Centers. But really when it comes to PM fees and asset management fees those all operate with a lag anyways. So you'll have all the information you need. The only forward-looking statement we think that investors would want us to make about RVI would be to predict the pace of asset sales. And we've been very clear all along that we're just not in the business of making those predictions. It doesn't help the shareholders at all.
Michael Bilerman: Right. And I guess at some point there will be an event once the sales -- the U.S. asset sales are completed about what this entity -- what the RVI is going to be. That's going to be standalone Puerto Rico. I think I had to point you, may make a decision to completely split. So even if you accelerate and do all the asset sales at whatever pace you do there will be the next event maybe a separation -- a complete separation. So it is going to drag on for a while. What I'm getting at?
David Lukes: Yes.
Michael Bilerman: Is there anything else I know we have talked a little bit about this at least $5 million and it came in at $7 million? Shouldn't that number had been very well. I mean that you just referenced the fact that there was the Form 10, it's pretty set in terms of what those fees are, so I guess why wouldn't you have known, it was going to be $7 million versus at least $5 million that extra $2 million?
Matt Ostrower: The big sense of the delta is lease commissions and we did not want to be to -- we want -- the reason we gave as we spied, I'm sure, we are sitting, [indiscernible] same thing. We are trying to be conservative in our guidance, right. We want to make sure that any number we put out there, we don't have to do a stupid leasing deal or anything else or to hit the guidance that you're expecting, right? So we're just trying to be prudent with that number. I think you should absolutely read into at least, correct me, do better than that. That doesn’t mean we absolutely positively will, but there is some upside to that and we've given you a range this time around. The reality is a huge swing, the year is going to be about the case of asset sales and in reality does not predictable to any of those things.
Michael Bilerman: Right. And then, you have the lag between, you're recording in G&A and the fees you get which will complicate things further. Okay. Thank you.
Matt Ostrower: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for your time.

David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good evening and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. 2018 was an eventful and exciting year for SITE Centers as we began our pivot to growth. All of our efforts can be thought of in the context of our five year business plan to deliver average annual OFFO and NAV growth of 5% driven by three sources. One, 2.75% annual same-store NOI growth, a large portion of which is from re-leasing the 60 anchor opportunities within our portfolio. Two, accretive returns on redevelopment and three, deploying $75 million annually on opportunistic acquisitions and investments with significant cash flow growth. Before I describe the progress we’ve made on each of these growth components, I’d like to discuss the $600 million joint venture we announced in November, which represents an enormous stride in derisking our plan. Specifically, we sold an 80% interest in ten durable assets into a partnership with two Chinese institutional investors. The transaction is material for SITE Centers. It pre-funds our growth plans with approximately $500 million of fresh capital. It allows us to cycle out of lower growth assets, and it expands our joint venture program with like-minded partners. And while this deal unquestionably stands on its own, we will be working to convert the relationships in China that we spent years building into a sustainable and attractive source of capital to fund our long-term growth. Returning to the results, and our business plan. Fourth quarter OFFO of $0.31 per share and same-store NOI growth of 2.1% were both ahead of plan on lower bad debt and property expenses and higher other income. The strong quarterly result allowed us to achieve full year same-store NOI growth of 2.3% not far from our five year 2.75% goal, a noteworthy accomplishment given that it includes partial rent commencements from only two of the 60 anchor leasing opportunities we identified at our Investor Day. Mike will comment on leasing in a moment, but I will summarize by saying that we continue to have strong activity with compelling economics. Our budget for 2019 and beyond assumes additional tenant bankruptcies. But this should not obscure the fact that demand for space in our portfolio of dominant assets in affluent communities remains robust. We’ve also advanced our redevelopment pipeline completing the Lee Vista development project in Orlando this quarter and Phase 1 of West Bay Plaza here in Cleveland with Fresh Thyme and ULTA now open and HomeSense expected to open any day. The transformation of West Bay came in ahead of schedule and under budget and we are already working on the underwriting and leasing for Phase 2. Our Brandon Boulevard project in Florida is now also well underway as we’ve signed key anchor leases converting the property from a Kmart anchored discount center to a grocery anchored neighborhood center with great leasing demand and strong cash flow growth. The initial phases of our other projects, many of which we identified at Investor Day are also moving forward. Commencement of these projects remains dependent on three variables, market demand, tenant approvals, and entitlements. These three legs form the foundation for successful investment and our work over the past two years has satisfied the first two legs leaving entitlements as our main focus going forward. That said, our decision to commence construction will also depend on our cost of capital, reinvest in opportunities and the risk and return of each project. SITE Centers own a portfolio that has been handpicked to maximize our exposure to asset densification and repositioning. Many of our projects were featured at our Investor Day Conference last fall and are heavily tilted towards simple site master plans that make profitable use of excess land and rearranging buildings for a much more profitable use of valuable real estate in high income demographics. These plans, and the significant success we’ve have today in advancing them are generating valuable optionality not reflected in current earnings and importantly, the NOI dilution from recapturing tenant control areas has already occurred. Finally, I am also pleased to announce the commencement of the opportunistic investing portion of our growth plan which seeks to take advantage of mispricing we are seeing in the market. In that vein, we’ve repurchased $50 million of our stock at a weighted average price of $11.74 per share, a level we believe is extremely compelling versus any measure of underlying value. Our quest for compelling returns also led us to purchase three assets during the quarter that we believe generates double-digit unlevered IRRs. The first transaction in this category is Melbourne Shopping Center, a 70% occupied shopping center anchored by a highly productive publics in Melbourne, Florida, which we purchased for about $50 per building square foot, about a quarter of replacement cost. We’ve already executed a 35,000 square foot anchor lease renewal at a 65% rent spread, well above our underwriting and we are planning of a renovation and tenant suite reconfigurations as we drive towards our targeted yields. This is a simple thesis that we intend to replicate. Buying at a low cost per square foot and making improvements to the buildings and site plan to accommodate current market needs in order to significantly raise rents and occupancy. The current property is averaging only $4 per building square foot in NOI and yet the immediate trade area supports much stronger economics recognizing assets that are underutilized in strong trade areas is a key feature of opportunistic investing and we plan using our platform to capture this value in retail real estate. A second and similar transaction was Sharon Greens, a Kroger-anchored shopping center in affluent community in suburban Atlanta with average household incomes of $150,000 per year which is now one of the highest in our portfolio. When supply is so constrained in wealthy markets like this, a landlord must respond with a leasing strategy to match the demand. This property hasn’t starved for capital for years and our simple solution to renovate and reconfigure tenant suites and underutilized land has already shown strong shop leasing demand at rents much higher than our underwriting. We achieved a purchase price, well below replacement cost on this asset as well and with an in-place NOI of only $7 per square foot, the market easily supports our targeted growth given its reliance on straightforward shop leasing which remains a focus of our company. Finally, our Market Square acquisition also outside of Atlanta offers it even higher targeted returns given the lower acquisition price per building square foot of $83 and a chance to increase occupancy through tenant expansions and leases. The theme for acquisitions this past quarter is all about low basis and high demand and all three are great case studies for an opportunistic investing program. They allow us to make money applying our vision, our leasing, our operating skills and they offer attractive entry price points. Most importantly, their return profiles are high enough to be competitive with that offered by our own shares. Combining our buyback with these acquisitions, it’s safe to say that we are ahead of plan on this portion of our growth strategy and we are seeing an increasing number of deals where we can leverage our company’s resources and operational skillset to create value. With that, I’ll hand the call over to Mike for some commentary on our operations.
Mike Makinen: Thank you, David. The fourth quarter saw more of the robust leasing activity that we’ve seen throughout all of 2018 with high volumes despite our now more focused portfolio. We’ve signed 26 of the 60 anchored leases identified at Investor Day with another 17 in advanced stages. This compares to 15 executed leases in October. We achieved a blended 31% leasing spread on the deals which are with 19 distinct brands. A few noteworthy deals this quarter include Total Wine & More at Centennial Promenade in Colorado, their first store in Denver market. ULTA Beauty at Shoppers World and leases with T.J. Maxx and HomeSense at Nassau Park Pavilion. Leasing spreads for the quarter were also solid with new leases up 14% and blended spreads of 6.4% consistent with trailing twelve month trends which we believe is the best way to look at our operating metrics given our now smaller and inherently more volatile portfolio. Net effective rents, an indicator of the overall economics of the leases we are signing were also in line with our trailing twelve month numbers as we continue to lease space at compelling economics. We remain laser-focused on driving our shop leasing efforts and remain confident in the 94% shop occupancy goal we articulated as part of our five year plan. I’d say this despite the fact that our shop occupancy fell in the quarter to 89.1% from 90.3% last quarter due largely to the sale of an 80% interest in the more highly occupied DTP JV portfolio, as well as the acquisition of the three low occupancy opportunistic assets David just described. Additionally, we had nine Mattress Firm stores closed as part of the recent bankruptcy. We expect to quickly re-lease these spaces at a double-digit spread, primarily with service and QSR tenants. We are also tracking a few more smaller bankruptcies right now that could further temporarily pressure our shop lease rate in the first half of the year. This potential dip shouldn’t obscure the ongoing large volume of shop leases being completed by our team. Overall, tenant demand remains high across our portfolio given the superior quality of our assets in the top quartile of the country’s retail landscape. With that, I’ll hand the call over to Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thanks Mike. All the accomplishments that Mike and David highlighted have had a significant impact on our balance sheet and capital position. Most important, positive same-store NOI growth and the use of proceeds from the new joint venture to repay debt generated a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6 times, our lowest leverage level in years. We also have no unsecured debt maturing until 2022 and a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years. We not only used equity proceeds to lower leverage but to improve both liquidity and our unencumbered pool with the virtual elimination of secured debt and the consolidated balance sheet. In fact, with the repayment of mortgage debt at the end of the fourth quarter, just two of our 70 wholly-owned assets are now encumbered providing significant optionality and flexibility. And all that’s to say nothing about the additional security provided by lowering our disclosure to lower growth assets or security capital from new JV partners. Repaying debt with dilutive asset sales maybe behind us, but that doesn’t mean we won’t continue to improve the balance sheet over the coming years. We expect NOI from new leases to become a growing EBITDA tailwind and our preferred capital investments in the Blackstone JV and RVI should provide additional capital to reduce leverage further and fund growth. As such, we now see six times as long-term leverage maximum rather than a goal to work towards. I’d like to now comment on several earnings and accounting matters. First, the refreshed 2019 OFFO guidance of $1.13 to $1.18 that we provided at the time of the announcement of DTP JV in November is unchanged. Same-store NOI guidance is also unchanged at 1% to 2%. As a reminder, consistent with our previous comments from Investor Day about the timing of anchor commencement, we expect our same-store NOI growth to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of 2019. Additionally, our 2019 OFFO guidance includes the impact of several items to consider relative to the $0.31 per share we reported in the fourth quarter. First, Blackstone continues to fill assets and that as well as selective asset sales in our other JVs will cause a decline in JV fees in 2019 as compared to 2108. Updated guidance now includes the fees from the DTP JV and we continue to believe that the headwinds from lower JV fees is largely resolved. A second headwind to 2019 results comes from the full year impact of 2018’s asset sales including the DTP JV which closed November 30, as well as announced that expected tenant bankruptcies. Specifically, the fourth quarter included approximately $500,000 of combined income from the nine Mattress Firm and Toys spaces that assumes closed. We have assumed additional tenant bankruptcies as part of our 2019 guidance. And finally, we previously flagged the short-term diluted impact of the redevelopment of our Van Ness property in San Francisco. The existing theater operator vacated in January resulting in a $0.02 per share headwind to full year 2019 OFFO. We have an executed lease with CGV Cinemas and expect them to open in January 2020. As David mentioned and consistent with our Investor Day, beyond this impact there is no remaining NOI plated to come offline in order to facilitate our redevelopment programs. Turning to RVI fees, our initial guidance hold for them to remain flat in 2019 assuming no additional RVI asset sales. There have in fact been a number of the asset sales since the fourth quarter and we are updating our estimate for fees accordingly which are $1 million lower at the midpoint. We continue to expect a one-for-one offset between RVI fee declines and lower G&A in 2019, though this relationship will shift in 2020 and we would expect some headwinds to 2020 from ongoing RVI liquidation until the RVI preferred is repaid and redeployed. On the joint venture front, we received a $7 million Blackstone preferred repayment in the fourth quarter and another $12 million so far in 2019, which brings our total receipt of preferred repayments to $154 million with the remaining balance net of evaluation reserve of $177 million. As a reminder, we established evaluation reserve with these securities in the first quarter of 2017 cutting book value by $76 million to $270 million. Since then, we have achieved key sales threshold levels in both Blackstone joint venture allowing us to receive approximately 50% of net proceeds from asset sales in Blackstone 3 and 100% in Blackstone 4 going forward. We recognize the current 6.5% yield on the preferred securities through every dollar we get back is the earnings equivalent of an asset sale at a 6.5% cap rate. The Blackstone venture helps us 19 of the 83 original assets remaining as of today and we marked all Blackstone assets to market each quarter to determine the reserves resulting in $7 million decrease in book value in the fourth quarter. With that, I will hand the call back to David for some closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. Before taking questions, I want to take a few moments to discuss 2018 which was a year of many accomplishments for SITE Center. We sold $1.8 billion of assets. We completed the spin of Retail Value Inc., tapped promising new capital from China and lowered our debt-to-EBITDA from 6.5 times at the start of the year to 5.6 times at the end of the year, all while pivoting to growth through leasing, significant redevelopment milestones and our first opportunistic investments. I couldn’t be prouder of our team and what we’ve achieved so far. I am also convinced to their most productive and innovative quarters lie ahead of us as we pursue compelling return on investments and sector-leading growth. And with that, operator, we will take the questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, guys. Good evening. David, just maybe starting with you, when you guys came in to the company, you articulated getting the company down to a bunch of assets that you thought could best grow and then you further paired it with the Chinese venture, obviously accretive capital. Do you feel right now that you have the portfolio you want? Or do you see the potential for maybe further JVs or asset sales outright from the existing assets as you guys move more into the – focusing on backfilling the anchors redevelopment, et cetera?
David Lukes: Good evening, Alex. And that’s a great question. I think we articulated when we announced the spin-off of RVI, but we had curetted to a portfolio that we felt had great growth prospects, but also had a lot of durability. If you remember we use the world durable quite a bit, over the course of the next six months, it became obvious to us that there are more reinvestment opportunities within kind of the upper half of the portfolio. We became enthusiastic about that. And so, the concept of recycling capital by selling off the more secured durable asset using that capital to recycle into the upper tier is one of kind of the easiest ways for us to grow the company. So I wouldn’t call it calling, I would say that it’s kind of a defensive move. It’s really more offense that we would like to recycle that capital into a higher use.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, so, if there is a potential for more, do you think JV-ing?
David Lukes: I think there is a potential for selling an asset to recycle it into another acquisition. There is opportunity for joint ventures should we find stable assets with low growth and we find potential to make reinvestments at higher growth. So I think you should expect that we won’t be shrinking the company in order to pay down debt any further. We are at a great level right now. We are simply using some of our more stable assets as currencies to reinvest elsewhere.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Matt, the question on the fees, it sounded like from your comments that the Blackstone fees wind down, there is an offset with the new Chinese venture. So, can you just help, is it a one-for-one offset? So basically fee income will be flat this year or is there a runrate that we should be sort of modeling to given the decline of the Blackstone, but obviously the rise of the Chinese JV fees?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, the Chinese fees do offset some, but we will still see a net decline in fees in 2019. That’s still a headwind to earnings in 2019. So there is some offset there, but it’s not complete.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. David, just first question, following up there on y our comments about the joint venture and you mentioned in your prepared remarks the importance of that relationship. Is there additional appetite from your partners to do more with SITE Centers? And what kind of appetite that you and your partners have to the extent that you do come across stable assets?
David Lukes: That’s a very good question. As you can imagine, I’ve been traveling to China for well over five years now and building relationships. One of my closest friends spends a lot of time in Hong Kong and Beijing for our company. I think we’ve built a reputation as a conservative investor that focuses on dividends. And there is a need in many parts of the world for dividend style investing in durable assets and to the extent that we can build those relationships and use that source of kind of core capital for us to fund opportunistic things for us to do, we will be very, very supportive of trying to extend those business relationships further. Whether that’s with our existing partners, the two partners that came into this joint venture or whether it’s others. And as you can imagine, if you do a joint venture of this kind, which is the first for this type of capital, institutional capital coming at Hong Kong, and the first in our asset class, it gives us some advantage because we are seen as more desirable now. Every quarter that goes by that we deliver on the dividends that we said we would. We become a desirable partner for other types of capital looking for core returns. So, and the long answer, yes, we certainly hope that we can build on this relationship and we are certainly poised for it.
Todd Thomas: And as we think about the $75 million investment target for the year, how should we think about that in the context of assets like you acquired in the fourth quarter versus maybe stable assets where you can leverage that $75 million investment on your end maybe generate additional fee income and move in that direction?
David Lukes: Yes. It’s difficult to subdivide the $75 million into different buckets. I mean, as you’ve already noticed in the fourth quarter, our share price got down to a point that it’s very difficult to find any other investment as exciting as our own stock and we put $50 million to work pretty quickly. There were other assets earlier in the fourth quarter that we thought had very high IRRs that were much more repositioning assets. We haven’t found a durable asset that we really like it, but I would say that that’s off the table. Everything is on the table as long as we think the risk and the rewards that are commensurate with the amount of capital that we have.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Just, from where you initially provided the 1% to 2% same-store guidance range at your Investor Day last fall, so you did the DTP deal and your 2018 same-store growth reserve at higher from removing those assets from the pool, but the 2019 range was unchanged and then you had Mattress Firm and Payless since then. But today, you are still at the 1% to 2%. So my question is, since there have been a few changes obviously from the time you provided the drivers at your Investor Day, maybe you could sort of walk us through any changes in those sort of underlying assumptions within that growth range?
Matt Ostrower: Hey, Christy. Thanks for the question. It’s very fair. I would say, we feel good about guidance. The main thing I would say is it’s February and as we all learn together, the retail environment is highly uncertain. So, I think, we track a number of retailers, I am sure tracking number of retailers that you’ve been in. And I think it’s premature to get ahead of ourselves and start speculating on the fund things going a lot better. So, we are just – I think we are trying to be conservative here. You are right, there is some tailwinds there. We also are expecting some bankruptcies as I discussed in my prepared remarks which are clear headwinds as well. So, offsetting those two and how early we are in the year it doesn’t seem appropriate to be changing our view at this point.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then, Mike, you had mentioned pressure on occupancy earlier in the year. How should we think about sort of the trajectory of the commenced occupancy rate? And then you’ve got this wide gap between sort of the leased and the commenced rate. How should we think about that widening or narrowing as we go throughout the year?
Mike Makinen: Generally, it’s the timing is the factor of making the back half of the year heavily weighted towards the rent commencement dates. But the timeframe between the lease execution and the rent commencement tends to be shortening and we are continuing to see that as we go forward.
Michael Bilerman: Hey David, it’s Michael Bilerman speaking. As you think about this joint venture you created, you talked about it being a dividend payer, stable assets, but the retail environment as Matt just talked about is highly uncertain. So how does those two things marry up over the next couple of years where that environment is probably not going to get anymore certain and probably continue to be uncertain. How do those assets performed in that environment leading to us to those expectations that you laid out with your venture partner?
David Lukes: Yes. It’s an excellent question. As you can imagine for the last several years in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, that has been a very, very common conversation. One way to prove the durability of kind of slow growing shopping centers is to look at a trailing ten year cash flow and understand through quite a few bankruptcies and a recession in the last ten years how did these assets performed. And I know that there is a general Zeitgeist in the reporting world that somehow retail is all in one bucket. But the fact of the matter is that, if you are looking for sustainable dividends, many times large format retail properties have been able to and I do believe we’ll continue to be able to deliver those. And that’s what we formed the basis of this joint venture. These are certainly not highly risky assets. They do have a little bit of occupancy upside, but mostly they are seen as stable properties. Bankruptcies will occur in these joint venture assets just like they will in our core. But the likelihood that they have durable cash flows long-term is still pretty high and I feel very confident about it.
Michael Bilerman: Are you guys covering any from a master lease perspective or preferred returns so that if there is additional bankruptcies or additional things that DVR – sorry sites, it can be hard for me to ever change, but that site will cover the differential to be able to provide that consistent return to your new venture partners?
David Lukes: No. The joint venture is a traditional joint venture. They bought 80% of the equity position. We have traditional financing on it. There is no preferred return. There is no Mez debt. There is nothing out of the ordinary. I think it’s just a couple of very, very sophisticated institutions. We spend a lot of time here in the phase underwriting the assets, meeting our teams, touring every suite and I think that they have a belief as we do that there is stable long-term investment. And that’s frankly the type of capital that we would like to be partners with. We want sophisticated partners. These folks did their homework over a long period of time and I would certainly hope that we’ve proven together that we’ve got a pretty good sense of the underwriting that we can go and look for new assets to acquire from outside the portfolio.
Michael Bilerman: That’ helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi guys. For those low dollar per square foot acquisitions, how much on average do you need to spend to get those up to your standards?
David Lukes: Hi, Wes, it’s a great question. It completely depends on what type of tenant we are planning to putting in there. One of the properties has a lot of medical demand and that tends to be more expensive than traditional. But the rent dropped so higher. I think the way you should assume is that, when we buy buildings at $50 to $85 a square foot, and rents in properties around that are in the 20s, there is a whole lot of room to reconfigure buildings and spend the capital required.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then, looking at your pipeline, you have the three TBD projects. I imagine they all make sense from an economic perspective and you are just putting on the entitlements for that. Do you expect to need those started this year?
David Lukes: The entitlements is the reason that there is TBDs in the supplemental. I would simply state that, in the context of capital allocation, it’s important to note that just because something is an intended development doesn’t necessarily that the construction is imminent. And as soon as we receive entitlements, and we have effectively a shuffle ready project, we have to look at that point in time and decide our other sources of investment opportunities better or worse than the development projects. So, yes, we are waiting on entitlements and yes, the financials make a lot of sense. But this last quarter, we have found some great places to put capital that I think are risk-adjusted much better.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Sticking with that, can you hold that for a set period of time or is it indefinite from the entitlement?
David Lukes: It depends on a property most municipalities now are doing spot zoning for a specific property where once the zoning is in place, it stays in place in perpetuity. But that does not mean that they can downzone the property in a couple of years if somehow the political climate changes. So, there is some risk. But I think the risk is years, not months.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Fantastic. Thanks for taking the questions.
David Lukes: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelley with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelley: Good evening guys. Dave, if I can kind of branch off of maybe Christy’s question, I guess, related to your assumptions on credit loss. If I recall, I think, Matt, your guidance assuming about 150 basis points of credit loss in 2019 and since we are half way through the first quarter of the year, where frankly the majority of retailer bankruptcies historically occur. I am just curious do you feel that – do you feel better that that’s a conservative estimate? Or have the changes in the retail landscape since you last gave guidance, maybe you believe it’s effectively sufficient like you are going to needle out?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, so just one – thanks for the question, Jeff. Just one clarification. The 150 basis points of bad debt plus bankruptcy adjustment that we made was to our five year growth number. So, we were saying that over each of those five years, we were assuming that now on average. We did not provide and deliberately didn’t provide a specific reserve number for 2019. The reality is the number is sizable and yes, I think we all feel better with each day. I think, we did a first one, I’ll call it to say that the kind of the cycle of bankruptcies happening at a specific time of a year seems to have been broken. The way the bankruptcies work out that cycle seems to have been broken. There is just a lot more uncertainty. So, I think we all feel better with each year it happens. But I think there is still, it’s safe to say quite a bit of uncertainty by 2019.
Jeff Donnelley: And just on the question on your recovery rate, I think it’s up 100 basis points year-over-year in full year 2018 and I think also up about 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. Considering that year-over-year decline in small shop occupancy and anchor occupancy, I guess, I would have expected to see some erosion in your expense recovery. And I guess, where am I wrong in my thinking there? And then second, as new anchors take occupancy in 2019, do you think that recovery rate can continue to rise?
Mike Makinen: Yes, Jeff, just one comment on, if you looked at our commence rate on Page 13 of the supplement, the commence rate was actually up year-over-year for the same-store pool which really drove the recovery uptick and now in the course of the year.
David Lukes: Yes, I mean, look, I think we’ve been saying, we expect things whether it’s the commence to lease rate or whatever, we are expecting things to pick up over the course of the year particularly in the fourth quarter. So, I think as you know the operating leverage here is tied to that. As we get more rents commence, you will see that ratio pick up.
Jeff Donnelley: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes, good evening. Your three drivers of growth, leasing, redevelopment, and opportunistic investments. I am just curious, over a one year and over through the five year horizon, which of those three drivers do you kind of feel will be contributing the most to your earnings over a one year period kind of a longer term period?
David Lukes: Good evening. It’s a great question. Over a five year period, it’s more difficult to project. But I think that, this company, as we laid out at our Investor Day Conference in the fall, have 60 box vacancies in a very well located portfolio and so over the near-term, the majority of the growth is coming from leasing.
Matt Ostrower: I would just point out that we – without revisiting them here, we did provide pretty clear ways in our Investor Day Presentation. So you can kind of take a look at kind of what our model says. The reality is as we found out in the last month or two as things present themselves in an unexpected fashion, whether it’s a share buyback or opportunistic acquisitions. So, I think, we gave some parameters there at Investor Day for you to use in your model. But I would say those are subject to continue as circumstances change. Leasing will be a very important driver over the next 12 to 18 months. That’s most important right now.
Tayo Okusanya: Great. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey, good afternoon. It’s only been two quarters that CapEx as a percentage of NOI has trended higher since the spin. Could you just provide some color about how we should think about the runrate for CapEx spend including redevs going forward?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, it’s Matt. I would just say, you are seeing the product of leasing activity, right. So, everything I’ve been saying about what we’ve been saying about things picking up in the fourth quarter of the year that this is all in preparation for that. You will see a significant amount of CapEx this year which we laid out where the vacancy is. We laid out how many anchors we’ve got, you can kind of do your back on the envelope there. As we get those 60 boxes commence, assuming the bankruptcy environment stays relatively constant, you won’t see increases in CapEx. We should see a significant decrease, but of course, that’s subject to what happens in the overall retail environment.
David Lukes: The only other thing I would add, Vince is, in the fourth quarter and the back half of the year, we had about $4.5 million for our LED lighting program. That’s one-time in nature. I don’t think we don’t expect that to recur in 2019. So for the maintenance CapEx, I do see a downtick there over the course of 2019.
Vince Tibone: That’s helpful. Thank you. And then just one quick one. Could you provide a little bit more color on the small shop or potential small shop bankruptcies you are tracking?
David Lukes: The ones we are referencing are really focused on Payless and Gymboree which have a very small impact on the overall portfolio. Payless for example, there is only seven stores that are wholly-owned portfolio and Gymboree has three stores. So it’s a pretty minor effect.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Thanks. It’s all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good afternoon. Just want to spend a little bit of time on RVI fee income. It’s non-trivial, pretty large. So, look, you put up around $7 million of RVI fees in this quarter and I think you are guiding to around $24 million at midpoint. How are you supposed to think about that $24 million of fees on sort of a quarter-by-quarter basis in 2019? Can we sort of think about it $6 million bucks a quarter? Do you think it’s going to be more front-loaded?
David Lukes: Hi, Rich. It’s a great question. It’s a big number. The reality is that we don’t know and we are not projecting the pace of dispositions from RVI. And so, I think the best way for you to assume in the modeling is that, our G&A slowly goes down in a commensurate fashion with the fee income. 2020 as Matt mentioned in his prepared remarks is probably is the year that has little bit more headwind as we are waiting to get back our preferred equity that we can then reinvest accretively to make up for that. So in 2019, I think it’s mostly to do about recognizing the G&A is going to go down in the similar fashion.
Matt Ostrower: And I was going to…
Rich Hill: Yes, go ahead, Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Keep in mind that you will see it in our Form-10 and the fee agreements we have. The fees gets remeasured only twice a year. For the mid we still have if probably fees go down the next day, right. So keep that in mind as well. You can imagine that we are going to sell assets. We don’t know how much. We are not going to forecast how much. We are going to sell assets, you will see gradually come down. But there is a six months lag to that process.
Rich Hill: Got it. And just to go back to one comment. And I think I understood this correctly. But 2020 is sort of the year where fee income starts to go down, but you are not getting the preferred equity investment and that’s maybe where there is a little bit of a disconnect for a period of time. Is that – did I hear that correctly?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, and our ability to kind of keep lowering G&A, and I think the cost of running the business we definitely right-sized the organization already. And so there is a limit to how much we can – we can reduce expenses throughout the organization just to offset those fees. And you are right. We’ll have to wait until liquidation is largely complete in all likelihood for us to get the preferred back to be able to redeploy it and get that accretion. So, there will be potentially some kind of a short-term disconnect there.
Rich Hill: Got it. And then, one question on the preferred equity investment reserves. It looks like they increased again. Is there any reproves as to how we are sure to think about that – does it mean, was it mean for the valuation of the overall market? What are we supposed to think about that and what we are supposed to consider?
David Lukes: I honestly think that what you are seeing is a smaller and smaller pool from the Blackstone joint venture. We are down to what - about fourth of the original size. And therefore, as we do a mark-to-market ever quarter, it’s a little bit bumpier than it was when the portfolio was larger.
Matt Ostrower: I would just flag, Rich, also if you kind of look at the historical adjustments, we took the original reserve, then we actually lowered the reserve by a significant amount in the next quarter as a result of a couple of trades that happened. And we just kind of eroded that back down to where we started again. So, net, net, I think what you are seeing right now is noise. I would warn you, if you – the other thing the market thing is a market and if transaction and the margins – we had the transactions on the margin tell us something we didn’t know before, or if the market actually changes, of course, it’s something traditional increases in that reserves.
Rich Hill: Got it. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. Just looking at the – I guess the Investor Day presentation of $100 million annual spending, $75 million of annual investments, and just thinking about that, routine cash flow. I guess, what you to do on the disposition side? Or what you have to either in terms of JVs to raise new capital to fund that over the next five years. Just thinking about what have worth the JV in the fourth quarter in terms of, you think that’s some sort of fees that were raised from that? So, what’s the look forward on asset sales, I guess.
Matt Ostrower: Yes, so, what we said at the Investor Day was that, our plan is largely $100 million, because of the preferred that we will be getting back with the combined operating cash flow and the two different preferred investments we have. If you assume those come back over the next five years we are largely self-funding. The other flex that we have obviously is on the opportunistic investing side. What we said with that, that would largely be coming through some kind of recycling activity to Alex’s question earlier in the call, when we sell more yet, we will sell more in order to invest at higher rates of return. That activity will be somewhat dependent on what we can sell on forward prices.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And that doesn’t changed at all, because given the size of the JV that’s done in the fourth quarter.
Matt Ostrower: Well, I mean, look, as David in the prepared comments, it’s a game-changer for us, right. I mean, it does really pre-fund a lot of this. And so I think the visibility on being able to invest $75 million opportunistically just went up significantly. The visibility on being able to invest into redev certainly went up significantly. So it gives us more cushion. So, I guess to your point, we don’t really have to sell at what the point I am trying to make is, our business plan originally didn’t builds in a lot of dispositions that were required and with the JV having closed, you can imagine that’s even less than it was before.
Mike Mueller: Got it. That was it. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good afternoon everybody. Just two quick ones. There has been a lot of talk about the bankruptcy tenants and alike. I guess, I was just kind of curious with the non-bankrupt tenants that are coming to their lease maturities are you seeing any change as it relates to sort of your tenant retention rates on those tenants, year-over-year or if you look out in 2019?
David Lukes: Yes, I think it’s a great question. I would hate to answer as a proxy for the entire retail market. I think, as we are looking at 70 assets that were hand selected to be in very high income demographic areas, kind of tight supply constraints, we really haven’t seen any change in tenant behavior when they come to a renewal. But also our pool is smaller and so, statistically to say, it went from x percent to y percent is more difficult. In general, the tenants are in our properties would like to be there, because they are profitable. And so, we haven’t really seen much of a change in their behavior when it come to an option.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. And then, I guess, David, on the opportunistic investments that you are able to complete, any sense as to what the competitive landscape was, who were just competing with against, sort of how competitive were those deals?
David Lukes: Yes, I think that’s probably the most fascinating part of this period in time in the last couple of quarters, whether it will continue or not, I don’t know. But if you think about it, buildings in very high income areas, very difficult to entitle new properties and so there is kind of a low supply. They can left behind as the world changes and these are particular have buildings that are outdated. When you have an owner that’s unwilling to keep reinvesting capital to make the buildings fit with current tenant demand, then the tenant demand goes elsewhere and you end up with this cycle where the rents get lower and lower even though the tenant gets higher and higher. When these properties hit the market to be sold, the demand was surprisingly low and it makes one say, why is demand low when you’ve got opportunity for leased occupancy, you’ve got great demographics, you got grocery anchors in two of the three. And the answer is that, there is only two types of buyers out there that are really aggressive. One is for squeaky clean assets that everything is done and it’s easy to finance at high leverage and I would say the others are ones where they don’t have to do a lot of heavy lifting on CapEx. This one fits in the middle zone which I think we have a lot of expertise on effectively putting our CapEx to work and we don’t need mortgage debt to finance assets that have all of the tenants in their option periods. And so, the average lease maturity is less than five years. I think that’s the reason why. So there was really not a lot of demand and that’s where the dislocation is and I hope we can find more situations like this.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Especially with a smaller portfolio and affluent MSAs, when you think about the overall tenant mix, are there any areas that worry you more than others, from a relevance or a saturation perspective?
David Lukes: In this specific portfolio, it’s hard for me to generalize over a small portfolio of only 70 assets. I can’t say that the tenant demand is strongest for convenience in neighborhood type of tenancies. And so, when we have tenants that demand a very, very large trade area, we are being very careful to put those tenants in assets that have an existing trade area that’s that wide. Mike’s team spends a lot of time analyzing consumer data and trying to figure out exactly where the trade area is on the existing properties. So that when we put a new tenant in there, we can be successful. If you pull this back to our capital allocation strategy, remember at Investors Day, out of 60 boxes that were vacant, we have 15 leased. As of today, we’ve got 26. So the volume of box lease is pretty dramatic which means the CapEx that we are putting into these properties is also quite large. And the result is that we need to be very, very careful to make sure that the tenants we are putting in these properties are going to be successful. And we are using a lot of customer data to make sure we are making that fit.
Mike Makinen: This is Mike. The only other thing I would add to that is the fact that, of those 26 leases that we have executed, 19 of those were of distinct brands of different uses, which basically support what David was just saying and that is that we are targeting the right tenants for the market and not just going after the same three or four tenants that happen to be doing a lot of deals.
Derek Johnston: That’s helpful. And just one last one. As you look to penetration of buy online, and pick up in store trends that we are all hearing so much about, I mean is there any actual feedback from the ground that you can give, maybe who is doing a more impactful job or a better job and others and if you are seeing any impact on traffic?
Mike Makinen: Yes, this is Mike. I think some of our grocery tenants that are doing order online and pick up the store doing a tremendous job to getting a different customer pattern to the store. And it also candidly allows some of those customers to do cross-shopping because they don’t have to spend as much time in a store, also find the BestBuy does a great job to creating a blend of online and really has turned into an omni-channel distribution center more than a traditional retail store. So we are seeing our best tenants are getting very good at it. And we are taking advantage of that and going after those types of tenants as much as we can.
Derek Johnston: Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we’ll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
44,SITC,1,2019,2019-04-24 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the SITE Centers' Reports First Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Ostrower. Please be aware that certain number of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties may be found in our earnings press release issued today and in the documents that we filed with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call including FFO, Operating FFO and same-store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in yesterday's press release. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.sitecenters.com. For all of you on the phone who would like to follow along viewing today's presentation, please visit the Events section of our Investor Relations page and sign into the Earnings Call Webcast. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning. I'm thrilled with our first quarter results which were measurably above our expectations due largely to better-than-expected operations, resulting an increase in our guidance. Most importantly, same-store NOI growth which is the key driver of our five-year growth plan we articulated at our October investor day was 2% in 1Q versus our plan for relatively flat start to the year. Additionally, our leasing team continues to make progress leasing our 60 anchor opportunities, half of which have now been leased, which will be a key driver of future growth. I haven't felt better about operating prospects since I joined SITE Centers two years ago and I'm equally enthusiastic about delivering on our plan to invest opportunistically. Our five-year program calls for $75 million of annual investments funded via capital recycling. During our last conference call, I indicated that we have already achieved our 2019 spending goals through the acquisition of three assets from our joint ventures and $50 million of stock repurchases. The acquisitions are already bearing fruit -- executed and approved leasing deals will bring occupancy up from 75% to 88% and with increased ABR by over 22% at the three properties in just a few months. Our ongoing opportunistic focus also resulted in two new transactions in the first quarter. First, we signed a management agreement with Credit Suisse, providing them advisory and operational services for 83 assets leased to Shopko on which they have recently foreclosed. Importantly, the agreement came with rights of first refusal for 10 assets in the portfolio and allowed us to leverage our existing operating platform to generate nearly 100% margin on any fees we received. Credit Suisse's needs were ultimately short-lived, but we nonetheless earned the $100 million in the process which was a contributor to our strong quarterly results. This transaction is in large relative to our enterprise value, but it represents part of SITE Centers' future, leveraging relationships and our operating platform to source opportunities, create value and generate profits. We will continue to seek involvement in situations like these that are a bit contrarian, complex or involve distress where we can source mis-priced assets and make money for our stakeholders. The second advancement of our opportunistic investment program during the quarter came from the sale of our Vista Village asset near San Diego for an approximately 6% cap rate. This transaction is a case study in how we think about capital deployment. At a high level, Vista Village is attractive especially in the public markets, given its strong demographics, high ABR per square foot, coastal location and grocery anchor. But our prioritization on returns and IRR means that these properties' slow growth profile and attractive exit valuation made it a great recycling candidate. The sale also highlights the quality of our portfolio. After two years of robust asset sales, the cap rates on our remaining portfolio are not surprisingly lower, which increases our ability to grow earnings through capital recycling. We expect to redeploy the proceeds from Vista Village and are now encouraged by growing pipeline of acquisitions candidates that will be accretive to the company's cash flow growth and importantly at a positive investment thread [ph] and accretive to earnings. We are highly focused on sustainable earnings and given our high cost of capital, I feel confident we'll be able to find something exciting in 2019 to acquire. Lastly, we're also making progress on our redevelopment plans -- the third component of our five-year growth strategy. Work continues on three active projects following the completion of West Bay Plaza this quarter which came in 8% under budget and a quarter early. And we are advancing the entitlement process for our pipeline projects in Atlanta, DC and Boston. Importantly, while we continue to weight a range of options and site plans for these properties, dilution from all these projects is already in our numbers, so there's only upside from the ongoing ramp of our redevelopment activities. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike to discuss our operating results.
Mike Makinen: Thank you, David. I'm very pleased with our reported 2% same-store NOI growth from the quarter, which was ahead of plan due to several earlier than expected rent commencements, higher than expected average rent and lower bad debt. The first quarter, we saw more of the robust leasing activity that we've seen over the last 24 months, with high volumes despite our now more focused portfolio. We have now signed half of the 60-anchor leases identified at Investor Day with another 15 in advanced stages. This compares to 15 executed leases in October when we first announced this goal and 23 at the end of the fourth quarter. These 45 deals represent a blended 37% leasing spread with 33 different brands. Noteworthy deals this quarter involves Burlington and [indiscernible], which completes the back fill of the former [indiscernible] Plaza and San Antonio and 24-hour fitness at FlatAcres Marketplace in Parker Colorado. All of these leasing activity has generated an increase in our pro rata portfolio lease rate to 93%, with 360 basis point spread to our commence rate of 89.4% which is almost 150 basis points higher than our average spread in 2018. Leasing spreads for the quarter were solid, with new leases up 23% and blended spreads of 10.7%. Importantly, these metrics are as or above trailing 12-month trends, which we believe is the best way to look at our operating metrics, given our now smaller portfolio and consequently more volatile quarterly metrics. Net effective rents, an indicator of the overall economics of the leases we're signing were also in-line with our trailing 12-month numbers as we continue to lease space at compelling economics. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving shop leasing and to achieve the 94% shop goal we articulated as part of our five-year plan. To that end, our shop lease rate rose this quarter to 89.4% after a debt in Q4 that was largely attributable to transaction activity. The final liquidation of Payless and Gymboree in the second quarter along with additional tenant bankruptcies remain risks to shop occupancy, but our lease volumes remain elevated and encouraged by our team's momentum. Overall, tenants' demand remains high across our portfolio, given the superior quality of our assets in the top portal of the country's retail landscape, and we continue to expect anchor rent commencements in the back of the year to be a significant driver of growth in 2019 and 2020. With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thanks, Mike. I'll first comment our balance sheet, then I'll touch on some earnings matters including how the lease accounting standard has affected our financial statements and I'll close with some comments on guidance. First on the balance sheet, our position remains strong. With an incremental decline in pro rate debt to EBITDA in the quarter to 5.5x driven by our strong operation and a recent closing of the Vista Village asset sale. We are happy with current leverage and pleased to put the diluted asset sales profits behind us in order to focus on driving FFO and NAV per share growth. Beyond improved leverage, our maturities are also in great shape with a weighted average consolidated term of six years. As David mentioned, we expected to deploy capital during the year, but the impact of the spending will be mitigated over time by three factors: first the ongoing ramp in our EBITDA primarily from the growth in same-store NOI; second, the ongoing repayment of our $170 million Blackstone preferred as that JV continues to liquidate. We received $12 million of repayments of this prefer in the first quarter of 2019 and payment of $75 million throughout all of 2018. And finally, over a longer time period, we expect to receive $234 million of total capital due to liquidation of RVI and the related repayment of our receivable and preferred investment in that company. All these means we continue to see fixed time debt to EBITDA as a long term leverage maximum rather than a goal to work towards. I'd like to now comment on several accounting and earnings matters. First, our financial statements reflect the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, otherwise known as ASC842. While our bottom line will not change much, there are some impacts in the standard to our income statements presentation. First among these is a change in the presentation of bad debt, which is now included as a deduction to rental income rather than as an operating expense previously. In the current quarter, this means the reduction of revenues of $441,000. We are unable to restate prior periods, so year-over-year comparison of GAAP revenue and expense line items will be made more challenging. While we are constrained in how we present the GAAP income statement, we have provided footnotes in our supplement, highlighting and reconciling these changes. We also have additional details on page 9 of our earnings slide presentation. A second change to the income statement is how we account for real estate taxes, paid directly by our tenants to local taxing authorities. This expense has previously appeared as both an operating expense as well as recovery income at a 100% rate. The new standard mandate omission of this expense and recovery from our own financials which means the reduction of both revenue and expenses by the same amount and a subsequent reduction in our reported recovery rate by approximately 1% in the first quarter. The bad debt and property tax expense presentation changes have no impact on GAAP net income, EBITDA, FFO, OFFO, or net operating income. I'd like to now highlight several additional earnings considerations that will affect the progression of OFFO in 2019. First, we recognize approximately $10 million of fees from RVI during the quarter, roughly $7 million of this consisted recurring asset and property management fees which we include in both NAREIT FFO and Operating FFO. We also recognize $1.1 million of disposition fees and a $1.8 million fee from a recently completed refinancing of the $900 million RVI mortgage -- both that we've announced or roughly $2.9 million were included in NAREIT FFO, but excluded from OFFO. Second, you will notice we recognized $2.6 million in lease termination fees in the first quarter. We have budgeted these fees and will obviously lose the income from the tenants from 2Q onwards, but we are excited to release the spaces with more dynamic tenants at a positive mark to market. Third, as you update your earnings models, please keep in mind that our first quarter included roughly $250,000 of revenue from Gymboree and Payless stores that are soon is closed clothes and are no longer paying rent. Finally, I'd like to remind you that percentage rent is seasonal in our business with larger contribution in the first and fourth quarters. All of these items: the lease termination fees, bankruptcy liquidation and seasonality of percentage rent should contribute to a deceleration of OFFO from the first and to the second quarter of 2019. Turning to our guidance update, we have increased our OFFO expectations by a penny at the mid-point and increased our expected same-store NOI growth by 25 basis point at the bottom into the range. This is a product of our better-than-expected first quarter operating results, tempered by ongoing caution about potential tenant bankruptcies throughout the remainder of the year. As we have previously noted, the million-dollar decline in 2019 RVI fee income forecast resulting from year-to-date disposition has been offset by a $1 million decline in our 2019 G&A forecast as well. We expect any additional reduction in the RVI fees forecast to be offset by G&A reductions throughout the remainder of 2019. Please recall from our previous commentary that we expect G&A to decline by a lower amount than fees in 2020. Finally, we have increased our expectations for 2019 JV fees by $1 million to reflect better performance. The increase in reported fees from the fourth quarter was related to the Credit Suisse deal that David outlined, as well as the full quarter of the China [ph] dividend trust joint venture. We expect JV fees to decline over the course of the year as Blackstone joint venture settles down its remaining 19 properties. To summarize, we expect the decline in OFFO from the first to the second quarter. We also expect store closings to cause a deceleration in same-store net operating income in the second and third quarters. That said, we are encouraged by our leasing momentum to date and continue to expect an acceleration in fourth quarter same-store NOI growth fueled by anchor rent commencements. With that, I will hand the call back to David for some closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. In conclusion, the last six months provide increasing evidence of this organization's ability to pivot to growth. We are now demonstrably ahead of schedule and executing on the operational opportunistic investing and redevelopment goals that underlie our plan to produce average 5% OFFO and NAV growth over the next five years. Operator, we are now willing and ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Just the first question. Matt, I just want to make sure I heard correctly and just to get your take -- the Gymboree and Payless, the impact in the first quarter that will not reoccur. I think you guys said it was $250,000. Is there anything additional -- like as far as all the headline announcements we've seen for bankruptcies etcetera -- is there anything additional that's coming out of your numbers for this year in addition to that? I think you guys said $250,000.
Matt Ostrower: In terms of the headline, there's nothing that we're aware of yet. The $250,000 is correct. That's what I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Gymboree and Payless. That number is correct. Keep in mind that we did have the lease term fees, so you know we're leaving some revenue associated with those tenants going forward and then of course we're budgeting at the high and low end of the range different numbers for potential future bankruptcies that we do think will actually occur throughout the remainder of the year, but nothing has yet been announced.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And what was the NOI associated with those lease terms?
Matt Ostrower: About $300,000 annually.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is going on your fourth quarter call, you guys mentioned one of the risks to this year was just getting the local approvals and all the things necessary to get those anchor leases open for later in the year. I just want to see how you guys are trending on this. You leased now 29, up from 23 before, but as far as your ability to get these stores open later in the year, is that still an open-end risk or you guys feel more comfortable that everything will be in place that you'll have -- I don't know what number you're anticipating, but having a certain amount? Maybe you can articulate that open for this year.
David Lukes: Good morning, Alex. It's David. I think it is an open-risk still, but we're also fairly confident that we're proceeding according to budget. So I think if you want to take the theme that we have internally here, it's that our budget feels accurate. Our assets are in pretty high income areas which usually means permitting and entitlements become more difficult, but our construction group has been working pretty diligently as we've been signing anchor leases and it's still an open item, but we're feeling fairly positive.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. I appreciate the color that you made on some of the deceleration from 1Q to 2Q. Maybe you could give us just a little bit of color about how much lease termination income benefited same-store NOI in 1Q, just to give us maybe a sense as to what we could expect and 2Q, once those are seasonally off the table?
Matt Ostrower: That doesn't really hit our same-store NOI, Rich, the way you're describing it.
Rich Hill: Okay. Well, let me ask you maybe a different way then. Given that same-store NOI is expected to decelerate, you obviously put up 2% in the first quarter. You raised the low end of guidance which I appreciate. You guys seem pretty bullish. Why not raise guidance even more than you did?
David Lukes: Hi, Rich. It's David. I think it's because we're only at the end of the first quarter and there's a lot of runway left. There are still some headlines over tenants potentially closing stores, so we're bullish on all of the good news, but we're also fairly cognizant of the fact that there are some bad news out there. So we're remaining cautiously optimistic.
Rich Hill: Got it. Look, I think in prior earnings call, there has been some focus on CapEx spend and it looks like CapEx spend actually came down somewhat meaningfully this quarter despite -- even as leasing spreads improved pretty significantly. How you're thinking about that? Are you seeing tenants demand less CapEx spend, I mean you're obviously pretty active; so any color around new leases relative to CapEx spend would be helpful.
David Lukes: That is an excellent question. I think that goes to the heart of how we're allocating capital right now. Our highest return on capital is leasing CapEx. We have great real estate, we've got great vacancy that we have to work where the inventory is strong but it's expensive. So if you're seeing a quarter-to-quarter bump around, I wouldn't read too much into that because the company is so much smaller now, it's hard to read quarter-to-quarter. I think you should expect that our leasing CapEx will remain elevated as long as we have high quality vacancies left. Matt, I don't know if you have anything to add.
Matt Ostrower: Yes. I think you will see volatility if the bankruptcy picture gets a lot better and we see a lot fewer bankruptcies over the course of the 12 to 24 month period, that our CapEx will come down, as simple as that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi.
Christy McElroy: Just one [ph] with 2018 team having been a relatively good year in terms of leasing volume, new demand for safe has held up well, rent spreads have helped up well. Just as we progress into 2019, you know, the overall retail environment has shifted a bit, retail sales momentum is slow, there has been more pressure in retailer margins, David, you just commented that you continue to remain cautious given what's out there. Have you seen any impact at all in your leasing discussions from the shift in the environment? Any early changes in tone with regard to retailers committing to new sale?
David Lukes: I'll ask Mike to comment in a second but I don't think we've seen any noteworthy change in tenant conversations. We're dealing with a much smaller amount of inventory right now in pre-high income trade areas, and those are always desirable from tenants. We have ICSC coming up at a couple of weeks so we'll probably get a little bit more information just because there is a lot of dialogue over a couple of day period. But I think the only thing that you could really point to when the occupancy and the robust nature of leasing goes on for a long period of time which it has, I think a landlord needs to be very careful about mark-to-markets and to the point circling back to our [indiscernible] disposition this quarter. You know, sometimes you end up with a property that have a very high occupancy but it's also got a mark-to-market that we don't feel confident about, and so to me that's a more important issue than changes in the demand from a tenant. Mike?
Mike Makinen: Right. The only thing I would add to what David just said is the fact that in general, the tenants that are expanding aggressively right now -- the tone and the overall conversation we're having with them hasn't really changed over the last several years. They are very eager to get stores open because that's what's driving their business and the overall conversations we're having -- we haven't changed that much over the last several years.
David Lukes: And just to circle back a little bit, just to remind you in the prepared remarks, Christy -- we talked about [indiscernible] with 45 spaces, right. So, the demand remains at least on the margin, our incremental activity continues to show diversity of demands in high level.
Christy McElroy: And then, just following up on the Credit Suisse Shopko deal, David, you mentioned in your opening remarks potentially seeking out other distressed opportunities like this. How are you sourcing these types of deals and is this more sort of one-off opportunistic or could this become a more sizeable platform for you?
David Lukes: I don't envision this type of transaction being programmatic. I think it really is opportunistic. We've done an awful lot of financing with Credit Suisse, Connor [ph] had a great relationship with the folks there and I think we were able to move very quickly to help them out of a situation where they needed some immediate systems and it gave us the opportunity to look under the hood in a bunch of assets and get road for us on 10 properties that we thought might be acquisition opportunities; they turned out not to be but I think from a conceptual standpoint we're very eager to jump into the stress situations where we can get an early read before the book is published, you know, look under the hood, we can really start to look at some assets and our leasing folks can decide whether there is an opportunity to buy some properties. So, it didn't work out with us buying properties but we basically got paid along the way pretty well to do the homework.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelley with Wells Fargo.
Jeff Donnelley: Matt, thanks for providing the bridge from your Q1 FFO to your annual guidance. I think of the items that you delineated account for about $0.03 a share of deceleration in your quarterly numbers, and I'm just curious, what would -- which in itself put you towards the top-end of your annual guidance. I guess what would need to come to pass to push you towards the low-end?
Matt Ostrower: Well, you're just simply taking some things out of the first quarter which I understand the math of what you're doing but keep in mind, we are talking about a further deceleration right in -- I think in the fee side of the equation, right, it's less than we used to liquidate. So -- and again, we have a range, right; so we're just building in a variety of scenarios, some were positive at the top-end and some were negative at the bottom, along what else we'd have to do with what happens with bankruptcy.
Jeff Donnelley: And maybe while the question is, how is your outlook for bad debt or credit loss in your updated guidance compared to what you're assumption was in your initial guidance, has that changed at all?
Matt Ostrower: No, not really.
Jeff Donnelley: And maybe one last one for you guys is; how was the tenant appetite for CapEx expenditures evolved? Are you seeing a stronger preference from retailers to use, leverage funds for their stores or is it seemed pretty confident overtime?
Matt Ostrower: It's funny to say it's constant overtime. That there are two notable changes maybe over the last 5 years. One is that construction costs in certain markets have accelerated, labor in particular and some raw materials and so that has had some impact but remember when a tenant opens a prototype, they have a work letter and the work letter has a description of exactly what finishes in materials and spit out what they have. So it's difficult for a tenant to start requesting a significant [indiscernible] capital when we have the work letter and we know exactly where the store is going to be built. So, it really has to do with labor materials but that's not -- I wouldn't say that's a number that's going to surprise anybody. The real CapEx cost is when you have to reconfigure the size of the space, and so when we do box sports or we do any other reconfiguration, that's usually when the costs come in higher was offsetting that as the rents were higher. So I think it's the elevated CapEx or box that's pretty opposing [ph] a much larger leasing spread, so I think the return profile is very similar.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Just as it relates to your comments on redeployment proceeds from Vista Village; can you maybe just expand upon the comments about the growing pipeline of acquisition opportunities you're seeing? And then, just along those lines discuss the type of opportunities you're most focused on right now just given your emphasis on growth?
David Lukes: Sure. While it's certainly part of the business we're most excited about. I mean we're in a great position balance sheet wise, we have plenty of time to be out there trying to source deals, and I guess if I could put it through safely, I would say that our acquisition strategy -- we've defined it opportunistic but I think that's simply because we think there are assets in the retail world that are mispriced and we very much are looking for mispriced opportunities because we can generate higher risk-adjusted returns. It doesn't mean that we're not focused, our focus and our discipline is starting with two different attributes; one is that we believe that strong communities are an important feature and they have to be the first filter on acquisition strategy. The second is, that the property within that strong community has to be convenient -- convenient to the big part of our leasing culture, understanding which tenants drive their sales from convenience. And if we use those two components as the departure point then from that honest, really a matter of measuring our risk-adjusted returns, is excited as we are; we're not in a great hurry to increase AUM for the sake of growth but we are very aggressive right now in seeking growth assets where we can use this operating platform to grow FFO.
Collin Mings: And then maybe just along those lines with the rights you have as part of the Credit Suisse agreement which again, seemingly that would lead to potential opportunistic deals or was there may be a recurring theme on one off or wide none of those. Deals made sense to you?
David Lukes: Yes, the primary components was that the entire portfolio was sold.
Collin Mings: Okay. Fair enough.
David Lukes: Look, I think that we were agnostic to the format, it could be big box, there could be multiple box, could be unanchored, could be community anger, could be grocery anger; I think we're really looking for assets where we can buy growth and use our operating platform and that gives us a lot of flexibility because I don't think we're backed into a corner other than strong communities, convenience to customers and great risk-adjusted return.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI.
Samir Khanal: David, you guys did the venture with the Chinese? Let's do some partner, I guess what's the appetite of this time to do more? These type of JVs with the same or potential partners now, that sort of time has passed and since you did the JV and perhaps there's been some stability, it sounds like in pricing for these larger open-air centers or power centers if you call them.
David Lukes: Well, I think I'm assuming when you say what's the appetite you mean from our side or from a Capital Partners side?
Samir Khanal: I guess both sides.
David Lukes: I mean, from our side, we really look at the joint venture business as having to have a purpose. One purpose is to allow us to buy things that we maybe couldn't buy without a partner. And the second is to be able to recycle stable, slow growing assets, recycle that capital and use our platform to go buy growth assets. So, our appetite to continue to do recycling joint ventures as long as we believe in the properties and it's a good capital partner, I think our desire is fairly strong. From the capital side, we have been back to Asia and I've met with a number of relationships and have talked about the deal that we got done in December and we would hope to be able to continue to source great future partners that have long-term sources of capital and are looking for consistent dividend returns.
Samir Khanal: Okay. And I guess my second question is around your leasing spreads. I mean despite all the closures that we've had, it's been pretty impressive when you look at the numbers where the renewals have kind of fairly stayed constant over the last several quarters at this kind of high single digit range. Do you think that will continue to be the case because you kind of get more headwinds as you've talked about potentially from other closures here?
Mike Makinen: Hey, Samir. This is Mike. To answer that, I think we do expect it to continue. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we're seeing an anticipated 37% cumulative leasing spreads for the overall group of anchor tenants that we're backfilling based on both the ones we've executed as well as the ones that are in progress. And one of the things that we're seeing here as was also mentioned among that group of 45 deals, there's 33 different tenants. And in many cases, we're seeing tenants vying for the same space and when they're vying for the same space it basically becomes a bidding war on the tenant's side. And we've had many conversations debating which tenant to go with and we ended up basically wearing them out and they ended up getting in a little bit of a trade war to go after space and it results in great rent. And so, we've seen a lot of that. And so, therefore, we do anticipate it to continue.
Matt Ostrower: The only thing I would add on the other side, Samir is that just remember the portfolio quite a bit smaller now. So, you are going to [indiscernible] numbers are going to get more volatile. We're going to keep focusing people on the trailing 12-month number because I know one of the next two or three quarters, we're going to a low leasing spread and the question is, do you extrapolate from that number? And at this point, we're always worried about new supply on the market, whether it's shadow or otherwise. But at this point, we don't see any reason to extrapolate from a little bit of the volatility in the numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Derek Johnston: Hi. Good morning. The commenced rate declined by more than suggested from the toys and packed. And could you talk about what else may have impacted that?
David Lukes: I don't know. I don't know the answer.
Mike Makinen: Outside of seasonality I don't think there's anything material.
David Lukes: It did surprise us. I guess I'll put it that way.
Derek Johnston: Okay. And then what annual escalators are you guys able to work into new and renewed leases?
David Lukes: It really depends on the lease. I mean I would say that the majority of anchor leases are still consistent with history, which are flat for five years and then there's a bump. And the escalators in shop leases really depend on the sub market. It can be anywhere from 2%, 3% 4%. But it's somewhere in that range and it really depends on the lease.
Derek Johnston: And I guess lastly, and just quickly, how competitive has the bidding process been for the recent acquisitions, especially for the highest quality assets that you guys are probably looking at?
David Lukes: That's a really good question. I think the assets we've been looking at generally, don't have a significant amount of competition since we've been looking at opportunistic purchases that are a little bit more value add oriented. But again, we haven't closed any deals in the last quarter so it's hard to make a comment on that. I still think that there is a pretty strong demand for tier-1 cities and coastal assets and the debt markets right now are wide open. And so, I think you are still seeing a fair amount of demand from most asset types.
Mike Makinen: Yes. I just want to [indiscernible] we're not going trophy assets companies, right? This is not the traditional, let's just improve the portfolio quality through the recycling process and the kind of the top down way, whether it's demographics or ADRs that people tend to look at. David's point about opportunism is about balancing risk and reward, but more importantly, driving for growth and returns, right? We have a high cost of capital. Buying a coastal grocery anchored center at a four cap is really not what we see as the right use of our capital at this point. So, we think quality can be much more broadly defined than maybe the traditional definition, but we are not -- this is not just the trophy ammunitions program.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey, good morning. You identified the [indiscernible] leasing opportunities in October. I know you made a lot of against that goal. What I'm trying to give a sense of is how many additional bankruptcies taking place, let's say over the last six months, since that October? Like what is the normal amount of 10 ensuring that we should expect outside of major bankruptcy activity?
Mike Makinen: You're asking how much did we add the [indiscernible] since we announced that? Is that basically your question?
Vince Tibone: Exactly, yes.
Mike Makinen: Very little is the answer. There may maybe one or two. Certainly, from a bankruptcy perspective, if you kind of think about what's happened since the investor day, there's been very little anchor bankruptcy activity. We obviously have a couple of names that are on radar. I'm sure you have them on your radar too so that could change going forward. Again, when you think about our five years seems to run a wide growth forecast of 2.5%, 2.75% rather. We built 150-basis point credit loss reserve into that number precisely because we believe we will be adding to the 60 our forecast incorporate that possibility, our numbers this year, our forecast this year assume there will be some of that. But as of right now, nothing has actually happened.
Vince Tibone: Got it. That's helpful. My next question is on leasing activity. Just over the last few quarters, only roughly 30% of new leases were comparable. I was just trying to get a little more color there to understand kind of what's the most common reason these leases are comparable. And if there's any way we can think about the economics behind these leases, whether it's CapEx or spreads or just how we can better think about this pretty big pool of leases.
Matt Ostrower: So, the comparable pools, everything, 12 months or less from the tenant move out. So, as David and Mike had mentioned a couple of times, we've had a renewed focus on some spaces that have been vacant for longer than 12 months. It also excludes the redevelopment assets. If we were to include those, the spread would be significantly higher.
Vince Tibone: Got it. Okay. So, overall those actually might have better spreads all in all than even the [indiscernible] terrible leases?
Matt Ostrower: Yes. So, as Mike mentioned, the 37% comp on 45 deals that includes some of the redevelopment assets which would not be included in that comparable pool.
David Lukes: Our goal has been to just be consistent in our presentation here. Obviously, the numbers could look higher if we broaden that pool.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Hi. Just in terms of thinking about fee income coming in, can you talk a little bit about Puerto Rico and just kind of how the for-sale market has evolved over the course of the past year or so there?
David Lukes: I thought it would make it through the call without a Puerto Rico question. I think the only thing I have to add, as you know, we have a kind of predetermined policy to not comment on RVI transactions only because we're always out in the market and we're usually in negotiating with multiple parties at the same time. So, we handle the communication from the RVI sales, including Puerto Rico through press releases once a transaction takes place. From an operations perspective, we've spent a good amount of time in Puerto Rico and I feel like we're making progress, but I don't really have much to add on the transaction side.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Okay. And then maybe sticking with transactions, the 6% cap rate on the asset that you sold this quarter, I mean, how would you think of that in terms of being comparable to the remaining, I guess, portfolio quality of SITE. I mean, would you say that's an atypical cap rate on the low side, that's why you flagged it or was it being flagged because you think it's a little bit more, I guess, relevant for what you own today?
David Lukes: I think I've been pretty clear that we went through the trouble and drama of creating a much smaller company through spinning off RVI. So, you could assume that we're happy with the durability and the growth profile of the assets we have left. From a cap rate perspective, I just don't feel confident describing cap rates across an entire portfolio since we just have such a wide collection of assets. This one happened to be a property that we thought was at the peak of its NOI story and there was a buyer that very much wanted to own the asset, a local buyer. And so, when that happens, usually, you're able to strike a pretty good deal. So, we're happy with recycling that cashflow into some other asset in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good morning, guys. I appreciate all the color this morning. I guess just a little bit on the anchor side, David, could you maybe provide some additional color on where negotiations might be for some of the boxes that remain in terms of what sort of activity you're seeing and what expectations might be for finalizing leases before the end of the year on the sort of the remaining buckets?
David Lukes: Sure. Mike can follow up on that.
Mike Makinen: Yes. In general, as mentioned, we were at 15 additional leases and advanced stages and the great economics and we're feeling very confident about that and we've got quite a bit of initial conversations on the balance.
David Lukes: If I could add a little bit of color that the reality is that the reason you're sensing enthusiasm from this management team is that the demand side of the equation is very healthy. A lot of brands are looking for space in the markets where we have vacancy, we have opportunities and the supply and demand is tilted in the favor of the landlord. There's no question. The [indiscernible] around budgets for the next couple of years really has to do with bankruptcies. So, the front door is active, it's the back door that I think we're all concerned about and that's why you're probably feeling that some conservativism is really based on the bankruptcy profile, not on the demand side.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. Thank you. And then I guess on the expectations for boxes that should seek commencement later this year, are there any, what I would call unique circumstances, whether it's a box split or change of use or something like that that might delay or is it mostly straight forward kind of a simple backfilling?
Mike Makinen: I would say it's generally very straight forward. There are some box splits, but we're on task and I think we're in good shape.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. And then I guess just the last question from me, just on the Vista Village disposition, was there any changes to sort of the interested buyer pool for that? You mentioned that it was a local buyer that wanted it, but was it fully marketed? How did that transaction go down? Are you seeing sort of different capital pools available today than say maybe a year or two ago?
David Lukes: It was a fully marketed deal. We decided to sell that property when we really achieved an occupancy level that we were happy with and felt like the rent profile didn't have the growth of the remainder of our portfolio. So, it was marketed and I don't think the buyer pool was any different than you would have seen over the last couple of years. I mean, the deal size was kind of mid-range. So, we had a lot of people looking at the property and I think we had a pretty healthy, better pool.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, guys. Now, what accelerated anchor we've seen? how should we think about CapEx maybe moderating in the out years looking at 2000, 2021? And then maybe can you comment on the CapEx intensity of the anticipated bankruptcies?
David Lukes: Well, I still think that leasing CapEx is very much tied to occupancy gains. So, as long as we're leasing anchors, you're going to see our CapEx remain elevated. And so, I think if you're looking at your models and your thinking, however long it takes us to lease these 60 boxes, that's probably the duration of the elevated CapEx unless there's more bankruptcies that grows that pot of existing anchor vacancies.
Wes Golladay: Okay. So, maybe, I mean you're halfway there now, assuming a similar pace or I guess the timing from signing the lease tab sheet, deploying the capital, but with maybe 2021 look like potentially a peak, assuming a normal anchor environment?
David Lukes: Yes. I mean, to be honest with you, we don't really run the numbers the way you're talking about them. We don't really run a scenario and we say, ""Okay, bankruptcies are done."" We are assuming that we just added the 60 over the course of this year. That's why we have a bottom and a top end of the range. So, definitely if bankruptcy stopped today, you would see CapEx continue through 202o to a very large extent. And then I think you're right. Conceptually, it should drop off in 2021. We should be so lucky that that's exactly what happens, but that's certainly not our base case.
Wes Golladay: You're fantastic. And then maybe can you comment on how you guys look at the dispositions versus acquisitions? Is it mainly an IRR or is it NPV? I mean what's the main framework there and how different is it, what you're looking at buying versus what you sold in the quarter?
David Lukes: Well, there's no question. We're focused on the present value of the future cash flows, which is really also an IRR analysis. But because we have an infinite hold period, I would say we're more concerned with the cashflow from the property over time. And if we think a property has a low cash flow due to slow growth and high CapEx, then it's a better candidate for recycling into something that we think has higher growth. We're very, very much returns-driven right now in our allocation of capital and in our dispositions program.
Mike Makinen: And [indiscernible] it's really easy for us to kind of run an IRR and we're assuming outgoing -- what are cap rates today for these assets that can run an IRR on all of these assets. And then with 68, we have a pretty granular sense of what the risk of all those assets is. So, the constant conversation internally, is what is the reward of this asset and what are the granular risks? And we kind of picked the least attractive tradeoff there and recycle that money.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for your time and we'll speak with you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
45,SITC,2,2019,2019-07-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the SITE Centers' Reports Second Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Chief Financial Officer, Matthew Ostrower.Please be aware that certain of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties may be found in our earnings press release issued today and in the documents we filed with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call including the FFO, operating FFO, and same-store NOI. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release. This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.sitecenters.com.For those of you on the phone, who would like to follow along during today's presentation, please visit the Events section of our Investor Relations page and sign into the earnings call webcast.At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. I am extremely pleased with our performance over the last three months which was measurably above our expectations due largely to better than expected property NOI and lower than expected tenant bankruptcies. The combination of these factors is leading us to increase our same-store NOI growth and OFFO guidance.I'd like to comment on how our quarterly results tie into the three major components of our five-year business plan, leasing, acquisitions, and redevelopment and then I'll hand the call over to Mike to discuss our operations in greater detail. Matt will conclude with some comments on the balance sheet, quarterly results and our guidance increase.First, same-store NOI growth, which is easily the largest component of our growth plan was 5.7% in the second quarter compared to our expectation of a deceleration from the first quarter. Our leasing team continues to make great progress re-tenanting our 60 anchor opportunities with 45 now leased or in advanced negotiations. The recent slowdown in tenant bankruptcies means all this work has begun to positively impact our economic occupancy, generating strong NOI growth from the average 36% spreads we expect to achieve on these spaces.The work we did over the last two years curating the SITE Centers portfolio means we own real estate in the highest quality submarkets in the country positioned to take advantage of today's tenant demand. We also continue to advance our investment program. As a reminder, our five-year plan calls for $75 million of annual investments funded via capital recycling. We achieved our 2019 goal through the share buyback program and acquisition of three joint venture assets, all funded with proceeds from the closing of the first China Dividend Trust portfolio in November 2018.We're working on additional acquisitions that could close later this year that would allow us to exceed the $75 million annual goal, funded largely from the sale of our Vista Village assets in San Diego in the first quarter. Our approach to acquisitions is the same as it has been in the dispositions and spin process, bottoms up rather than top-down. We are solving for cash flow growth and returns driven by convenience and value-oriented properties rather than simply seeking out certain formats or geographies.Finally, we're making progress on our redevelopment plans which represents the third component of our five-year growth strategy. Work continues on four active projects including West Bay Phase II which we added to our supplement this quarter and we are advancing the entitlement process of our pipeline of larger scale projects in Atlanta, DC, and Boston. We've made the most progress to date on Duvall Village, one of several projects featured at our October Investor Day. Located in Prince George's County a zoning tax amendment was recently passed which allows for the conversion of this property to new residential and retail uses.During the entitlement process we received an offer for the land that would allow us to receive all of our expected development profits immediately rather than over the course of a multiyear redevelopment. So we've opted to sell the property for approximately $10 million which represents a 3% cap rate on in-place NOI, providing capital we can reinvest in the remainder of the pipeline at a significantly positive spread. We don't expect quick pay offs on all of our projects, but I do see Duvall as a case study in balancing redevelopment risk and reward.Before closing, I would also like to acknowledge the hard work done by our whole operations team as well as our Senior Vice President of Operations, Joe Lopez and the publication of our fifth annual sustainability report, as well as our recognition as a Silver Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Alliance. These are just the two of the examples of the daily work that this company does to ensure sustainable growth through healthy relationships with our key employee, investor and community constituencies.In summary, SITE closed the second quarter in an extremely strong position. We have focused portfolio positioned to benefit from occupancy uplift, solid tenant demand, and a balance sheet that provides us flexibility to invest opportunistically. We've made great progress in our five-year plan to generate 5% average annual earnings and NAV growth, as well as a 2.75% same-store NOI growth.And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike Makinen to discuss our operating results.
Mike Makinen: Thank you, David. I'm very pleased with our reported 5.7% same-store NOI growth in the quarter, which was well ahead of plan due to fewer than expected tenant bankruptcies, higher-than expected recovery rate due partly through expense timing, earlier than expected rent commencements, and receipt of $1.3 million settlement from the Mattress Firm bankruptcy. Our same-store NOI would have been 4% without this payment.The second quarter saw more of the robust leasing activity that we've seen over the last 24 months, despite our now more focused portfolio. We have signed leases for 33 of the 60 anchor vacancies identified at Investor Day with another 12 spaces at lease or in ROI. This compares to 15 executed leases just nine months ago. These 45 deals represent a blended 36% leasing spread with 34 different brands. Importantly, we continue to expect anchor openings to accelerate with 6 openings in the second quarter and an additional 10 openings through year-end mainly in the fourth quarter.All of this leasing activity has generated a 90 basis point increase in our pro rata portfolio leased rate to 93.9%. Importantly, our lease to commence spread, which is the best indicator of low risk, embedded future growth now stands at 390 basis points, 30 basis point increase over the last quarter. This large spread provides us confidence in our ability to achieve our five-year 2.75% same-store NOI growth target even with 1.5% annual NOI reserve for tenant bankruptcies.Leasing spreads for the quarter were solid with trailing 12 months spreads in line with our historical leverage on elevated volumes. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect our smaller polio to translate into more volatility and quarterly metrics. So I encourage you to look at our leasing results on a trailing 12-month basis. Net effective rents, an indicator of the overall economics of the leases we're signing, were also in line with our trailing 12-month numbers suggesting still compelling tenant economics.We remain confident in our ability to continue driving sharp leasing and to achieve the 94% sharp goal we articulated as part of our five-year plan. Our sharp leasing activity this quarter was as high as we've seen in some time and these deals have more attractive economics. Despite all the activity, our sharp lease percentage dropped this quarter because of the Payless liquidation in which we recaptured 13 stores. These locations along with other high quality available space remain a source of future growth.All of this operational progress is the product of enormous effort by many often unsung heroes especially in our leasing department. This quarter though, I'd like to also specifically call out the efforts of our construction management team who are behind the complex work required for store openings often in very compressed time periods. They've delivered 36 spaces ahead of schedule this year with an expected positive impact to our budget of almost $600,000. I congratulate and thank our head of construction, Joe Chura and his team for their outstanding tireless work.With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thanks Mike. I'll first comment on our balance sheet, then I'll touch on some earnings matters and I'll close with some comments on guidance.First, on the balance sheet, our position remained strong. The pro rata debt-to-EBITDA in theQuarter at 5.7 times compared to 6.4 times in 2Q 2018. The unimproved leverage of our maturities are also in great shape. We have weighted average consolidated term of 5.7 years. We also announced this past Friday the recast of our line of credit facility and term loan extending the facility's maturity, improving liquidity, and measurably lowering our borrowing costs as a result. I would like to thank our bank partners for their ongoing support of our business.As David mentioned, we expect to deploy capital during the year, but the impact of this spending our leverage levels will be mitigated by three factors. First, the ongoing ramp in our EBITDA primarily from growth in same-store NOI, second the ongoing repayment of our $170 million Blackstone preferred as that JV continues to liquidate. There were no Blackstone dispositions in the second quarter, but we did get more clarity on prices for dispositions expected to close later this year which has caused us to marginally increase our evaluation reserve on the remaining preferred.Our current $78 million reserve compares to the $76 million we initially established in 2017, though there been several upward and downward revisions since then because we mark the preferred to market on a quarterly basis. We have received a total of $155 million of preferred repayment since inceptions of these securities with the remaining net value of $170 million.Our third source is additional JV asset sales. We had limited activity this quarter, but expect additional dispositions will occur over the next year. And a final source of deleveraging is the $234 million of total capital we eventually expect to receive for the ultimate liquidation of RVI and the related repayment of our receivable and preferred investment. All this means, we continue to see 6 times debt-to-EBITDA as a long term leverage maximum.I'd like to now turn to some earnings related items. First, while bankruptcies had a much smaller impact so far in 2019 than we anticipated, something which is helping fuel our guidance increase, we did recognize $340,000 of revenues in the quarter from Charming Charlie and Payless that has since closed or announced that they will close and will therefore not recur in the third quarter.We also expect to lose approximately $400,000 of revenues from Dress Barn in the fourth quarter. There will be significantly less capital and downtime associated with these non-anchor closures and we are excited about the backfill and mark-to-market opportunities, though they will still act as a drag on 2020 growth. Second, this quarter included a 400,000 positive revenue impact from an outside bad debt reserve reversal that is one-time in nature.And finally, as Mike mentioned, we received a $1.3 million settlement from the Mattress Firm bankruptcy resolution. This was included in other income. While this is obviously a large one-time item in the second quarter the payment is equivalent of one year's worth of rent and recoveries for this tenant, so the annual impact is a push.I'll turn now to our change in guidance. Given the greater clarity we have at this point in the year, as well as significant outperformance in the first two quarters, we are increasing our OFFO and same-store NOI growth estimates. Specifically, we have increased our OFFO guidance by 4 pennies or 3.9% at the midpoint which we believe represents measurable OFFO growth on a spin adjusted basis. We have also increased same-store NOI growth by 110 basis points at the new 2.75% midpoint to reflect a better than expected economic occupancy throughout the year stemming from fewer tenant bankruptcies.Given the timing of anchor rent commencements, known tenant closures and bankruptcies and a tougher comp in 3Q, we now expect same-store NOI growth to trough in the third quarter below 2%. Specific quarter-over-quarter headwinds include as Mike mentioned, $750,000 of quarterly revenues bankrupt tenants in the second quarter that won't recur, expense timing, and a decline in other income.Finally, we adjusted guidance for fee income and G&A in 2019 with JV fees modestly higher due to higher property NOI and RVI fees lower due to completed asset sales. Based on asset sales completed to date, we RVI fee income excluding disposition fees to equal approximately $5.1 million in 3Q and 4Q 2019 before stepping down again in 1Q 2020 as RVI continues to sell assets. G&A was lowered to $60 million as we continue to manage expenses, but as previously mentioned lower RVI fees will act as a significant headwind to 2020 OFFO. JV fees will also likely decline from 2019 as our partners look to harvest capital.With that, I will hand the call back to David for some closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. In conclusion, the last six months provide increasing evidence of this organization's ability to pivot to growth. We are now demonstrably ahead of schedule in executing on the operational opportunistic investing and redevelopment goals that underlie our plan to produce average 5% OFFO and NAV growth over the next five years.Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks, good morning. David, first question, just thinking about the quarter here you commented that you're ahead of plan and on track for the five-year plan, but as we think about this year's performance in this quarter in particular much of which was related to operations, I'm curious why you aren’t tracking ahead of plan for the five-year plan or if that's not the right read?
David Lukes: Hi Todd, good morning. I think it is probably just too distant in the future to speculate on a change in our five-year plan and just bear in mind there are two important factors; one is that we've taken what we think is a very realistic bankruptcy reserve through the remainder of the five-year program and some quarters will outperform and other quarters we might underperform. These past two quarters I think there have been fewer bankruptcies than we would have imagined. So I think in aggregate we're still on plan.The second piece of the puzzle, I think you have to remember is, that our operations and our NOI is trending very positively, but keep in mind that the fee burn off from RVI over time also has an impact the other way.
Todd Thomas: Okay and then, sort of a two-part question on dispositions and the related fee income there. So the pace of dispositions seems to have slowed a little bit in the quarter, is that intentional on your partners' behalf with interest rates down maybe demand being a little bit better off year-to-date than unexpected?And then the second part related to the JV fees, so you had previously commented the fees would likely trough I believe in early 2020 and I think you're suggesting they would decline, but maybe there is an opportunity to form some other strategic partnership or an opportunity to backfill the fee income there. Can you update us on your current thoughts there?
David Lukes: On the slowdown Todd, are you asking about Blackstone specifically or are you saying just JVs generally?
Todd Thomas: Yes, JVs generally, but maybe you could touch on Blackstone's positioning as well.
David Lukes: Todd, on the Blackstone portfolio and several others, we don't really control the pace of dispositions and so it's really squarely outside of our purview. The RVI portfolio that we also receive fees on, it's been noted that company's assets are all for sale. The timing of those sales has more to do with the exercise of anchor options that affect the value of the property more than it does the desire of RVI to sell assets. So we're a little bit beholden to the timing of when transactions take place.For joint ventures in general, it is a business that is compelling for us. We do have a certain amount of scale. It allows us to feel a lot of deal flow and I would say that strategically as joint ventures naturally mature and go away then we'll be working to replace those over time.
Todd Thomas: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could comment regarding the lease versus occupied spread has been increasing which supports your leasing strategy. So I was just wondering when you consider your watch list and future outlook for occupancy, how comfortable are you that this will end up a tailwind to higher occupancy versus having to compensate for additional upcoming potential closures?
David Lukes: Hi, good morning, Caitlin. I mean, I think at this point we've seen such dramatic demand from the anchor business, I mean the piece about Mike's prepared remarks that I think you've really got to take to heart is that we've signed 45 leases and LOIs out of 60 and that's a 36% leasing spread which is enormous historically and even more impressive is with 34 different brands.So I think you're seeing a tremendous amount of demand on the box side which has surprised many including ourselves and it is a healthy business right now. So the watch list tenants remain there and I do think that the industry will continue to have bankruptcies and store move outs, but I think if you have the right real estate in the right submarkets and the right co-tenancy that the demand is going to be there to fill it up. And this portfolio for one certainly has a lot of built in mark-to-market.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it and then maybe just on the redevelopment side, could you go through for the two projects that are planned to open in 2019 Nassau Park and Brandon Boulevard, kind of percent leased that you've gotten to on those and maybe the difference between the two projects, maybe it's just scope that one will just take it seems like one quarter to stabilize and the other will take about a year?
David Lukes: Yes, Nassau Park Pavilion was a redevelopment of a Kohl box in Princeton New Jersey. It is a 100% leased and is effectively a reconfiguration of square footage that we recaptured and that's why you're seeing the stabilization happen so fast, it's just as the tenants ramp up and open it all happens within a one quarter duration.The collection of Brandon Boulevard is a Kmart recapture that we were able to receive back about a year and a half ago. It was the last Sears Kmart that this company owned and the occupancy rate at this point is trending what might about 75% to 80% and LOIs and the activity we have on the remainder of this space, I think we've got a pretty proven guideline for when that final stabilization occurs.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it, okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hey, good morning, guys. Matt just some follow-ups on the same-store NOI question, you talked about the Mattress Firm payment and the bad debt reversal in 2Q [ph], just trying to figure out inherent in the same-store NOI guidance increase who much of that revision was fees items. So how much of that had you previously anticipated in the guidance range versus how much of it was driven by your expectations for better core growth and I'm not sure how much of this better is sort of recovery rate in the second quarter would define it?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, thanks Christy, we did not budget Mattress Firm. That's a transactional item which you know is not sometime we're willing to kind of forecast per se. So I would see that one is certainly outside of budget. And bad debt reversal is really about the pace of bankruptcies that we've had. As David and Mike both mentioned in their prepared remarks and me as well, bankruptcies have just been significantly lower than we expected. So the guidance is really about, yes we got some money back from Mattress Firm as a contributor.We're also seeing rents come in more quickly, as to Mike's response, as Mike's comments about our construction team getting spaces open. We had a little bit of a benefit in operating expense timing this quarter that will be reversed next quarter. And then bankruptcies generally at this point of the year we are looking forward and we get more clarity as we mentioned, we get more clarity now about what's going on at the rest of the year and so that's part of the upward guidance as well.
Christy McElroy: Okay, so if I look at the piece of base rent growth in the first half of about 1.4% to 1.5%, how should that look in the back half of the year, is it more [indiscernible], but then offset by certain further impacts at closings that you mentioned?
Matt Ostrower: Yes, so I would put revenues together, right? So you saw, you read about the 1.5-ish increase from that. We also got another 40 or so basis points from ancillary. All this stuff is connected. The third quarter, I think you're going to see a slower pace of revenue growth; a) because of a tough comp and b) because if you look at our – what we said about the timing of anchor commencements, they are really going to happen more in the first quarter than in the third quarter. So the growth will pick up more in the fourth quarter.I think our view is, what we've been saying all along is, you are going to see the robust revenue growth happen starting at the end of this year and then going forward. In the meantime, we've managed to pick things up and improve margins and squeeze profitability out of same-store portfolio which we're perfectly happy with.
Christy McElroy: Okay, thanks Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, everyone. Mike or David, when I look at your net effective rents, and I know when you look at the new and renewals, I mean they've held up pretty well on the net effective side, but then when I looked at new leases, they were down a little bit even from a trailing sort of 12 months basis here. I'm just trying to figure out what's kind of going on there?
Mike Makinen: Hi, Samir. Just, this is Mike. I just wanted to kind of emphasize the size of this portfolio is always going to going forward have some bumpiness to it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, and when you look at this portfolio and as an example if you have one anchor space of 40,000 feet or so, that has relatively modest bump and requires some CapEx. It can actually cause a quarterly number to fluctuate. When you look at this aggregately across the rolling 12-month basis, it really does kind of temper things and if you look at last quarter for example, you had a very high leasing spread related to prior rents. And CapEx in this quarter, we have a small portfolio and there is some bumpiness.
Samir Khanal: Okay, thanks. And then I guess my next question for you Mike is, can you generally talk about sort of how leasing discussions are going with potential tenants, clearly there is a lot of noise out there and there are bankruptcies, closures, but have you seen any sort of changes in sort of conversations over the last six months, maybe three months, are there any changes in sort of economic asks or noneconomic asks coming from them?
Mike Makinen: No, the answer to that is no. I mean when you look at the myriad of tenants that were doing new deals with, the conversations are really not terribly different than they were over the last five years. With existing tenants talking about renewals, tenants we've been doing this for many, many years, and tenants are always working to try to get the best deal. And when you have really good real estate, you can see that we continue to see increases. And I would say there is not a dramatic change in the tone of the conversations.
Samir Khanal: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. Good morning over there. Two questions; first, just a general retailer question, you guys and others have commented that the pace of bad debt or sorry, bankruptcy, store closings is a lot less than expected. So is your view that a lot of these headlines that we see of tenants announcing various plans to close, are those – it is essentially all bluffing or is it that they're trying to close, but the economic reality means they don’t want to pay lease term or is it that these tenants for the most part have been able to revamp their merchandise plan or revamp the part of the business that was ailing them, in which case they are able to last longer.So said in a different way, is this just that the tenants are proving to be more durable than we all expected or is it a matter of that it's just taking a long time for these tenants to work through, and if they don't go under this year they'll be going under next year if you will?
David Lukes: Good morning, Alex. It’s a really good question. I think that that subject has come up a lot, particularly over the last quarter or two. And for us it's hard because you want to talk industry in general since there are so many newspaper articles about retail disruption and it's accurate. There has been a lot of disruption in retail, but for a company of our size and we own less than 70 wholly-owned assets, it's difficult to be a proxy for the overall retail industry.And so, I think maybe what we are saying is that if you own really good real estate, even if a tenant is changing their store fleet, they are probably not going to change the ones that are making money. And the four wall [ph] EBITDA that comes out of boxes and shops that are within our 70 wholly-owned assets, I think are strong enough that they have proven to be very, very durable.The flipside of that question, you're asking about existing tenants. The flipside is, is the demand for space and I keep coming back to what Mike said during his remarks, a 45 anchor deals that we've done or are working on they are 34 different brands. So there's a tremendous depth of demand for space in our portfolio and it puts pressure on existing retailers to renew at rents their market.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is for Matt. Matt, you mentioned for next year for 2020 there is going to be decline in RVI and the JV fees that provides a bit of a headwind. Can you just sort of put some color or some brackets around like magnitude, sort of a range of millions of dollars that we should be thinking about that's going to come out of next year as RVI continues to wind down and it sounds like you wind down some of the JV, some of the JVs?
Matt Ostrower: Thanks, Alex. Yes, so we’re not providing specific forecast yet, in part because we don't really know. One thing I will remind you of, the lion's share of this really is coming from RVI. I’ll come back to your JV comment, but on RVI, we originally laid out somewhat arbitrarily a three or so year liquidation plan. 2020 would mark the third year following what we -- following the spend itself. And that’s not because we have some visibility on exactly what’s going to happen and when, but we are trying to take I think a prudent approach. So, you could assume I think most importantly, very significant reduction in fees from RVI over the course of next year and that I think is the lion's share of the headwind that we are talking about.By the same token, the JVs as David mentioned, we don’t really control the Blackstone JVs, but they are I think motivated to sell those assets relatively quickly, so we expect some headwinds there. And then other JVs the retail landscape is changing and JV partners are always being active and thoughtful about what they own and some of what they bought five or 10 years ago may not make sense today. So I would expect some headwind there as well. So I am not going to quantify anything at this point, but I do think it is something that you should consider as you’re looking forward into your next 12 months.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color on maybe some of the fundamentals that you're seeing in your business. Given that you are active in the sale market maybe not directly with SITE Centers but RVI and the quality of your assets, I was wondering if you could just maybe give us an update on how you think the sales market is trending for the assets that you're looking at recognizing that RVI is in exactly what SITE Center owns?
David Lukes: Yes, Rich, I am going to -- and good morning. I am going to stay away from commenting on RVI's asset sale process. I will say that the CMBS market is alive and well and that is the key indicator for asset sales, particularly in secondary markets. So I think as long as the rates and the door is open for decent financing, I think the transactions market is pretty alive.
Richard Hill: Got it. And I'm sorry, I wasn't specifically asking you to talk about RVIs, maybe giving some color on what you thought about cap rates, but it sounds like you think cap rates are stable to maybe even a little bit tighter given how open the CMBS market is, is that a fair characterization?
David Lukes: Yes, I think that's – it’s a fair generalization. I think I can talk more on the acquisitions side as we look to deploy capital and you think about what is most enticing to us, it’s durable cash flows with growth, and that sometimes is different than cap rate, right?A lot of this comes to our CapEx and the mark-to-market and in place, so I would say as opposed to cap rates being stable are coming in, I think it's that durable IRRs effectively underwritten are very, very valuable to a lot of different investors and so we’re seeing and witnessing a lot of competition for growth assets.
Richard Hill: Got it. That's helpful. Talking about the durability of cash flows, just one follow-up question, you've obviously been pretty successful having partnerships from Asia, can you maybe talk about just that demand that you're seeing from durable cash flows from foreign investors?
David Lukes: Yes, I think that nothing has really changed from when we closed on our $600 million, our joint venture with the Chinese institution. There is a demand for U.S. dollar-denominated dividends and to the extent that you can find durable assets that may have a smaller growth than domestic fund might want, I think that the foreign capital is seeking yield, and I think our asset class can deliver that yield. So we’re active and continuing to have more dialogue on that front.
Richard Hill: Okay. Great, guys. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Shivani Sood: Hello. This is actually Shivani Sood from Deutsche Bank. Just following up on the earlier questions on the private markets, have you guys seen any change to the competitor pool in terms of the bidding process for the assets that you are looking for, just given that you are sourcing from more of a nuance strategic perspective versus some of the institutional capital out there, there might be looking for more of a buy-and-hold asset?
David Lukes: Good morning, Shivani. I don't really have any characterization on the buyer pool. It feels like every asset we look at there's some players that are consistent and there are some new ones. I think there’s an awful lot of capital I think available for durable assets and so you’re seeing public and private together competing.
Shivani Sood: Great. And then as a follow up, you guys have really been at the forefront in terms of leveraging customer and geographic data to gain an edge on the leasing and tenant negotiations, can you give us an update on your efforts there and how that might have facilitated faster than anticipated re-leasing of the anchor boxes?
Mike Makinen: Thanks for that question. This is Mike. We are developing an internal team. We’re continuing to grow our analysis tools and we've seen tremendous value as we’re looking at potential tenant mix strategies, acquisition strategies, and we’re seeing that is something that we’re going to be in the front lines of developing over the next several years.
David Lukes: Shivani, there have been a couple of specific examples that are intriguing. We had an asset in the Atlanta market and there was a tenant we were trying to persuade to join our lineup and there were some questions whether their customer was going to be available on the property. And the data that we've assembled and Mike’s team has been able to work with effectively proved that their customer profile was coming to the property with some frequency.And we really have never had that data before, but in the last year it really has given landlords a big benefit to be able to market to some of the mom and pop tenants that don’t have a big department and prove to them that their customer is on the property. So it's been great on the leasing side. I think at this point we’re also using a lot of this data to help us with our acquisitions.
Shivani Sood: That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Hey, good morning, guys. Good quarter. So I want to ask a couple of questions on lease and economics. The CapEx usage this quarter was up 40% as a percent of rental value. I'm just curious about the type of tenants you bring in, is it the credit or just a longevity, is that 45 out of the 65 that you signed? Can you just provide some color on the quality of tenants you are bringing in?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, I’ll address your -- the 40% number first and then I’ll hand it over to Mike to talk about mix. But just be aware that that net effective rent number is a fully loaded number, right? Everything that we’re doing, the lease spreads like for all of our peers, there is some sample issues there in terms of which leases are in or out depending on duration and the space et cetera. This is a fully loaded number and so it's simply a change in that CapEx number is about a change in activity, right? It's not about change in underlying economics per se. And with that, I am going to hand you over to Mike.
Mike Makinen: Yes, Ki Bin, as far as the quality of tenants, I think it is important just to simply give you some of the tenants that we've looked at, signed leases with, and have LOIs with over the last several months, and this is strictly anchors. But I am just going to rattle up a few. We’ve done deals with Fleur de Core [ph], DSW, Ross, T.J. Maxx, HomeSense, Best Buy, Sprouts, Planet Fitness, Five Below, ULTA, Total Wine, Burlington, and the list goes on. This is a great pool of tenants with phenomenal credit who are basically looking to be in the best locations and we've pretty much proven that this portfolio is offering that.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay and if I look at the leasing economics over the past year and a half, I know that you guys fully know that number by looking at it from a trend perspective it has been trending higher and I get it. I don’t want to miss the [indiscernible] all positive reasons, but just from a holistic standpoint, should we expect the CapEx usage for SITE to increase, the actual CapEx usage to increase over the next year, because the signed leases are -- on a signed basis the CapEx usage is based on kind of real time usage of that CapEx. So should we expect that’s an elevated usage level?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, let me give you one comment and then I’ll hand it back to Matt, but I think you have to always bear in mind that when we have transparency with our fully loaded numbers and a portfolio that’s less than 70 wholly-owned assets, you are going to see volatility based on the pool and the fact of the matter is, this portfolio was curated with an excessive amount of anchor opportunities.As we lease those, the pool of space that we’re leasing is dramatically larger than a long-term run would be. Once the occupancy stabilizes, then I think you can see that change, but bear in mind we are looking at trailing 12 or you are looking on kind of industry averages, just keep in mind the size of our portfolio and the fact that there’s an awful lot of leasing taking place.
Mike Makinen: I’ll just followup, so just to be clear, our net effective rents I don't see a change in trend there. The net effective rents have been flat to even marginally up. That’s something that we’ve seen for years now.In terms of spending dollar, the absolute dollars we have just said that we have signed on the order of we’re about to sign 45 anchor leases. So if CapEx did not go up under those circumstances you should question our disclosure, right?So I think we've been very transparent that there will be a lot of anchor leasing volume this year with rent commencements that are really going to pay off for the spending. The rent commencements begin at the end of this year, but you’ve seen that number ramp. We are not showing an increase in CapEx on that basis.We do expect an elevated level of CapEx compared to say five or six years ago because in our forecast we are assuming 150 basis points per year of bankruptcy loss, right? So we expect bankruptcies to remain elevated and therefore CapEx will remain elevated. That being said, we don't expect that kind of ramp in CapEx to happen again. I would actually say over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, you should see some moderation in that spending, but it all depends, Ki Bin, as you know, it just depends on what happens with anchors and the bankruptcies.
Ki Bin Kim: All right, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, guys. Looking at the Dressbarn, it looks like you know well in advance that tenant may be leaving, how does this help you in the leasing and how quickly can you turn that space and just in general how is demand for the space?
David Lukes: Hi, good morning, Wes. We don't really know what is going to happen with Dressbarn. I would say that in Matt’s prepared remarks he mentioned that and we're simply taking the worst case scenario from a budgeting perspective. If I shift to the opportunity side, I think Mike and his leasing team, particular to this retailer who happened to have older leases, the mark-to-market is exciting for us and so I think they have been soft marketing those spaces in the event that we get them back, but we really don't know anything other than the market does.
Wes Golladay: Okay. In that situation where your soft market and you did have a contingent lease and you signed at the day after they filed. So how soon can you get them in the space?
David Lukes: I don't think it's any different than the previous bankruptcies. You’ve seen that the larger spaces are 18 to 24 months and the smaller spaces are a little bit faster. What it really depends on is how many of them are leased at the same size and how many of them are split up and are more profitable shops. And I honestly don't know the answer to that until we get the space back and get more serious.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey, good morning. I just had a followup on Dressbarn as well. If you could just talk a little bit about how the closure process was negotiated and specifically, how they were – Dressbarn was able to get out of their leases in the fourth quarter without filing for bankruptcy within the parent, any color there would be helpful?
David Lukes: Hey, good morning, Vince. The only color I can give you is our decisions. We have not signed anything with Dressbarn and at this point we’re simply collecting rent as per their lease agreement.
Vince Tibone: Got it. Okay. So nothing formally has been executed then and so just -- what is your budget if that going forward there is no rent starting in the fourth quarter?
David Lukes: December, yes.
Vince Tibone: Got it.
David Lukes: October, I am thinking about October, but that is a conservative and somewhat arbitrary decision, could be negotiations are ongoing. We’re not going to comment on those specifics, but -- other than this thing we haven’t committed to anything and it could be better or worse than that or it shouldn’t be worse than that, it could be better than that loss [ph].
Vince Tibone: Got it. And then just one more, somewhat of a followup question, but do you expect having this split up a lot of the Dressbarn locations to get demand or better leasing economics or you think that single tenant user will be kind of the most common backfill there?
David Lukes: The most common backfill will be to have a single user, but there's going to certainly be some spaces that we’ll need to be split.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: Our next question is a followup from Christy McElroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, its Bilerman here for Christy. David you talked a lot about the Duvall project that we shouldn’t expect these quick payoffs in terms of the redevelopment in most cases you would likely go forward with the redevelopment. I just wanted to understand that you have sort of looked through it. I know you've done a deep dive in every asset. Has sort of the resi [indiscernible] at Duvall and being able to monetize it change any of your thinking as you look across the portfolio for more of those opportunities either to sell or to embark by yourself?
David Lukes: Yes. It's a great question, Mike and I will admit that even my own temperament has changed over the last couple of years. I wouldn't say it's because redevelopments are more risky, it's simply that there are other uses for capital which are more accretive and less risk. It’s as simple as that.Duvall was a nice simple clean project that had zoning amendments that allowed us to perform a mixed-use plan, but when we measured our own probability that plan made more sense to sell it to someone, and I have a feeling that that will continue.There is simply a lot of risk in a redevelopment project. It takes a lot of time and if we can find acquisition assets or our own stock or our preferred shares that have a really good return and good underlying assets, the risk reward simply tilts in the favor of investing in something other than development.
Michael Bilerman: And then this question on guidance, Matt, you sort of went through some of the one-time impacts, the fees and other things that came about in this quarter. Most of the guidance increase, predominantly all was simply the beat. It doesn’t appear as though what you guys have described as naturally be better, materially better in terms of performance is impacting second half – the second half run rate from an FFO perspective is about $0.28 a share, you did $0.31 so it’s actually a deceleration. Why isn't any of the benefits that you guys are talking about actually boosting more near-term results in terms of second half FFO?
David Lukes: Thanks, Mike. Yes, so I can’t just agree with the logic of what you said in terms of we’re raising it by the outperformance versus consensus. I think what we try to do is get guidance based on what we have visibility for. We had some one-time items that are not going to repeat, so that I think by definition that felt that you could see less revenues next quarter in aggregate when you saw this quarter. If Mattress Firm doesn't happen again and we don’t think it's going to happen again, you could see it sit down.I would also highlight, we did have some benefit on expense timing just you know, as it happens from time to time we had some expense slip into third quarter from the second quarter so that will happen. And then there are things and we’re not just trying to be kind of overly conservative, but there are things that can affect our numbers, right?We’re opening a lot of anchors in the second half of this year. They are big spaces. If they slip by as much as two or three weeks, that and the smaller company size, that can actually impact our numbers. So I think we’re taking a relatively prudent approach to this. We’re not trying to be overly conservative. If things go all go well, then yes, we could see numbers go higher I suppose, but this is kind of what we see as a base case sitting here today.
Michael Bilerman: I am just trying to triangulate a little bit about some of your commentary around how robust everything is from a leasing, the same-store, and if it's not really impacting the second half in terms of a run rate relative to consensus or even zero numbers right, because the beat [ph] was predominantly just rolled into full year. What really has changed, right? If you’re really not getting the go forward benefit of beat, is the beat is really confined to the single quarter then or you are being overly conservative? I'm just trying to piece it together. Right? Because I hear such strong language in terms of outperformance, but it doesn't seem to be flowing through in the back half in a real meaningful way?
David Lukes: I wouldn’t say we use such a strong language. I think we did outperform our own estimates and our operations have gone certainly better than we expected, in large part, because of our lower-than-expected bankruptcies. That part will absolutely continue. You can rest assure that we have lowered our so-called bankruptcy reserve, overall for the year, so I think that should give investors some comfort, but you know, to the degree there were some one-time items that don't recur. It is hard for me to pretend that those were simply some kind of fundamental recur in beat.
Michael Bilerman: I was just going off of materially stronger than-expected operations measurably above our expectations.
David Lukes: But Mike, let’s just keep in mind, there’s a different between FFO guidance and same-store ROI, right? FFO was a larger number. It is affected by certain transactional items that like one-time items more so than same-store is. We did materially increase our same-store guidance. So we've got that kind of in the bag, I think that's something that should be reassuring to investors and it does represent stronger outperformance.If anchor spaces continue to open earlier than we expected or even as expected, you could see some upside there as well. I think we’re just trying to be prudent about the various moving parts involved in the rest of the year.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Craig Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Craig Smith: Great, thank you. Mike, just wondering, have you been talking with Pure1 [ph] or Bed Bath & Beyond and are they talking about potentially closing stores?
Mike Makinen: First of all, we generally won't comment on specific tenants, but couple of things to keep in mind, we do maintain a conservative outlook with a 150 basis point reserve for potential tenant bankruptcies, so we’re mindful of things that are happening out there. And again, as I said earlier, is nothing new to tenants attempting to modify rents when renewals are due and as you can see we continue to show growth in our portfolio.
Craig Smith: Okay, great. And then I noticed that the small shop occupancy takedown, would you expect that to pickup by the end of the year or what's causing that?
Mike Makinen: Borrowing further small shop vacancies I would expect that to pick up. Our bankruptcies, our continued momentum on shop leasing is really, really strong.
David Lukes: In the prepared remarks Craig, we mentioned that the entire downtick was due to Payless, right? So we can’t control those bankruptcies. What we can control is leasing volume and that is going well and continues to show upward momentum.
Craig Smith: Yes, I guess you know the stronger consumer seems to have been helping maybe not less the national small shops and I thought maybe that you would see an increased appetite for the third pizza parlor or a near full on [ph] shop or something, but thanks for the information.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good morning, everybody, just a couple quick ones. On the 10 anchor boxes that are expected to open by the end of the year, so any chance that you actually pull forward any more than the 10?
David Lukes: Probably Chris less likely, anchors have certain periods of time which they want to open and so normally you are scheduling something for 4Q open or 2Q open, it would be very rare for us to pull in some from next year into this year. I think it will be more common is it if we’re able to get folks open sooner. That’s the -- if you are looking for an upside scenario, on the last quarter we overachieved on opening sooner than planned and if that continues then you would see an improvement in the fourth quarter, but I don't see the number of boxes are increasing dramatically.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thanks. And then just a question about the anchor leasing activity velocity, on the 60 boxes you guys have been talking about from first quarter to second quarter it feels like there's like a net increase of one lease deal which is obviously well below the pace you guys have been executing on before. So you closed four, but the net number of conversations you're having in closed from 44 to 45 based on second quarter versus first quarter earnings calls. Is that a seasonal issue, what is the issue there?
David Lukes: I think you are just looking at a small portfolio in a 90-day period honestly.
Mike Makinen: Yes, Chris, keep in mind if you recall a number of these boxes were holding back redevelopments, so the pool kind of leasable space hasn’t changed which almost fully encompasses that 45 boxes where we have activity today.
David Lukes: I think we feel pretty good about pace. There’s no slow down, there’s nothing we're going on. It’s just -- it’s a little bit too much of a micro view.
Chris Lucas: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Petersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
JonathanPetersen: Oh, great, thanks. I am just kind of curious if you could give us more of your thoughts on redeploying some disposition proceeds, acquisitions versus share repurchases, and maybe specifically as you underwrite IRRs on property acquisitions, kind of what the hurdles are relative to repurchasing your stock?
David Lukes: Sure, Jon, it’s a great question. We certainly have all of our options on the table at any given point. Right now we sold an asset in Southern California last quarter and we have those proceeds that we’re looking to deploy, so we’ve been somewhat active out trying to find a good replacement and as you can imagine we’re trying to balance the IRR with the risk.Three assets we brought out of our joint venture business in the fourth quarter. We purchased at a seven cap and as of today I believe there are about 25% higher in NOIs than they were six months ago. So that type of asset does allow a lot of growth and I think the IRR on a risk-adjusted basis is much higher than our stock.On the other hand, sometimes our stock gets at the point that it's pretty attractive as well and we've shown that we would execute on that. So we got a lot of levers to growth and to your point, I think we simply are looking at the different options at the time that we have the capital.
Jonathan Petersen: Okay. Thanks. That’s all from me. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yes, hi.Most things have been answered, but I was wondering just on the remaining 15 boxes that you need to lease still, should we expect anything materially different in terms of economics relative to what you got on the first 45?
David Lukes: I don't think so Michael, other than the fact to remember that a lot of those boxes that are between 45 and 60 are in properties that we’re holding them back for redevelopments, like in Atlanta and in Boston. And so, it could be that those get demolished and turned into some other type of redevelopment or it could be that they are split and we’re using that square footage elsewhere. So if they were to be leased without turning them down than I don't think you see anything different in the economics.
Michael Mueller: Got it, okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we look forward to talking with you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
46,SITC,3,2019,2019-10-30 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the SITE Centers' Third Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would never turn the conference over to Brandon Day Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Good morning, and thank you for joining us.

This release and our quarterly financial supplement are available on our website at www.sitecenters.com.For those of you on the phone, who would like to follow along during today's presentation, please visit the Events section of our Investor Relations page and sign into the earnings call webcast.At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm extremely pleased with our performance over the last three months which was measurably above our expectations due largely to better-than-expected property NOI and lower G&A. Our Ongoing operating momentum is leading us to once again increase our same store and NOI growth and OFFO guidance. I'd like to first comment on how our quarterly results tie into the three major components of our five year business plan; leasing, redevelopment and acquisitions. Before discussing a couple of key capital transactions, and then I'll hand the call over to Mike to discuss our operations in greater detail. Matt will conclude with some comments on the balance sheet, quarterly results and our guidance increased.First, same store NOI growth, the largest component of our business plans was 1.6%, marking the trough we forecasted preceding a number of anchor openings expected in the fourth quarter. The midpoint of our new 2019 guidance range is now ahead of our five year average we laid out at investor day, helping validate the most important part of our growth. In terms of future growth, we continue to advance the lease up of our 60 anchor opportunities identified at investor day. Given that there are 48 now least on advanced negotiations at a blended 36% leasing spread, and that several of the remaining spaces are held for redevelopment. We are nearing the end of our work on the spaces.We also continue to advance our investment programs. As a reminder, our five year plan calls for $75 million of annual investments funded via capital recycling, a goal we achieved this year through share buybacks and the acquisitions of three joint venture assets. As I mentioned, last quarter, we have begun working on additional acquisitions, one of which closed in October. Vintage Plaza in Austin is a small transaction in terms of dollars, but it's a good case study as to how we're looking at deploying capital.First, we expect the properties vacancies and below market leases to produce NOI growth well in excess of our portfolio average. Second, the adjacent seats Adele headquarter campus represents a natural anchor, drawing thousands of consumers commuting to and from work and allowing the center itself to be more focused on smaller service oriented shop space. And finally, analysis of the trade area demonstrates that the center's actual customers are mix Adele and other office employees who are both much more affluent and draws from a much wider trade area than the traditional three mile demographic analysis would suggest. We hope to have a few other investments to discuss in the upcoming quarter, all of which will highlight our bottom up format agnostic approach to finding investments that generate compelling returns above our cost of capital.Finally, we're continuing to make progress on our redevelopment plans, which represents the third component of our five year growth strategy. Three new anchors opened in September at Nassau Park in Princeton, New Jersey are quarter early and work continues to work another three active projects. We're advancing the preleasing and entitlement of our pipeline of larger scale projects in Atlanta, Washington DC and Boston. Like the sale of Duvall village in Prince Georges County discussed last quarter, we remain focused on realizing value on these projects, whether it means capturing profits early through a sale, mitigating risk to a joint venture or executing projects on our own.I'd like to now touch on two transactions since our last call, both of which materially improve sites future growth capacity. First, on October 1, we announced an agreement to unwind the existing $1.1 billion joint venture relationship with TIAA-CREF. This venture began in 2007 and the portfolio has underperformed our Core for quite some time now, especially post spin.The end of the venture proves our growth rate and provides us with $170 million of gross capital to redeploy an asset with much more compelling returns. The second transaction is the $195 million common equity offering, we completed last week in order to repay our outstanding 6.5% series J preferred stock. This deal with a product of our consistently articulated desire to continues to deleverage without inflicting meaningful earnings dilution. The replacement of the preferred with common accomplishes this goal, lowering our leverage without materially impacting OFFO, AFFO or NAV per share. These two transactions add to the list of decisive steps we have taken over the last two plus years to position the company for outperformance.In summary, SITE closed the third quarter extremely well positioned for the future. We have a great team, a focus portfolio poised to benefit from the uplift driven by solid tenant demand and now an even better balance sheet that provides us enormous flexibility to invest opportunistically. We have made great progress our five-year business plan.And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike Makinen to discuss our operating results.
Mike Makinen: Thank you, David. I'm very pleased with our reported core operations this quarter, which were ahead of plan due to lower-than-expected tenant bankruptcies, earlier than expected anchor rent commencements and higher-than-expected ancillary and other income. We feel great about the momentum in our core operations both in terms of anchor and shop leasing volumes. We opened 13 consolidated anchor tenants in the third quarter. The majority of them earlier than expected and we plan to open an additional for the fourth quarter. As David mentioned 48 of the 60 original anchor opportunities we identified at investor day have now been leased or in advance discussions with commencements expected in the fourth quarter 2020 and 2021 providing a multiyear tailwind.Shop leasing activity was especially robust in the quarter, the 51 shop leases we signed marks a three-year high for this portfolio and we achieved a new lease rents per square foot of over $30 a foot for the first time in our company's history especially impressive given the high volumes. All this week century strong economics with new and renewable spreads as well as not effective rents right in line with our historical averages. It's hard work getting such high volumes and rents but our job is made easier by today stronger fully owned portfolio and a great operations team.Strong leasing activity and modest bankruptcies in the quarter generated 30 basis point increase in the pro rata leased rate to 94.2% and while our commenced rate increased by 110 basis points to 91.1%, the gap between the two numbers, which is the best indicator of low risk future growth is still a healthy 310 basis points. This spreads provide us added confidence in our ability to achieve our five-year 2.75% same-store NOI growth target. Even with a 1.5% annual NOI reserve for tenant bankruptcies.We are especially focused as well on our shop lease rate, which fell 90 basis points sequentially this quarter to 88% despite the activity I just described. The decline was entirely attributable to the fact that the tenant bankruptcies in the quarter were concentrated in our small shop portfolio with nine Avenue and seven Charming Charlie closures since the end of June.We already in conversations with tenants for each of these locations and feel great about back fill prospects.With that, I'll hand the call over to Matt.
Matt Ostrower: Thanks, Mike. I will comments first, our balance sheet, then touch on some earnings matters and will close with some thoughts on guidance. First on the balance sheet our position remains strong with pro rata debt to EBITDA in the quarter at 5.8 times, compared to 6.5 times in 3Q '18. Beyond improve leverage, our maturities are also in great shape, with a weighted average consolidated term of 5.5 years. Last week's equity offering will generate further improvements, lowering pro forma net debt plus preferred to EBITDA by almost half a turn.In addition to the deleveraging impact of the recent offering and EBITDA growth, we have two other sources of future capital. First, is $160 million remaining preferred investment in our liquidating Blackstone joint venture. We did increase the valuation reserve against the remaining preferred investment by $6 million to $85 million, which compares to the original $76 million reserve we originally established in 2017. However, the increase this quarter was due largely to the loss of an anchor tenant at one of the Blackstone assets, rather than a change in market conditions for the shopping centers.A second additional source of deleveraging is the $217 million of capital we eventually expect to receive through the ultimate liquidation of RBI and the related repayment of our receivable and preferred investments. We received the $17 million payment from RBI this quarter, representing receipt of half of the $34 million original receivable. All these factors growing EBITDA, the Blackstone preferred and return of capital from RBI means we continue to see six times debt to EBITDA as a long-term leverage maximum.I'd like to now turn to some earnings related items. First, while bankruptcies have had a much smaller impact so far in 2019 than we anticipated, something which is helping fuel our guidance increase, we did recognize $169,000 in revenues in the third quarter from Avenue and [indiscernible] stores that have since closed and will therefore, not recur in the fourth quarter. There will be significantly less capital and downtime associated with these non-anchor closures and we are excited about the backfill and mark to market opportunities, though they will still act as a drag on 2020 growth. We also recognize $481,000 of revenue from dress barn and Forever 21, and we expect all of these locations to close in the fourth quarter.I'll turn now to our increase guidance. Given the greater clarity we have at this point in the year as well as significant our performance in the first three quarters, we are increasing our OFFO and same store NOI growth estimates. Specifically, we have increased our OFFO guidance by a penny at the new midpoint despite short-term dilution from our equity offerings. We have also increased the expected same-store NOI growth rate that underpins our OFFO guidance to a new 3% midpoint to reflect better year-to-date operations and expected increases in anchor openings in the fourth quarter. These openings will be partially offset by the $650,000 of total quarterly revenues from bankrupt tenants, which we expect to continue into the first half of 2020.We also made a number of smaller guidance this week's for JV fee income, RBI fees and interest income, with a change in JV fees related to better than expected performance and clarity on the timing of the DDR TC1 down. We provided guidance for 2020 JV fees with a DDR TC announcement and remain comfortable with a $16 million to $20 million range we provided at that time. In terms of RBI fees, based on asset sales completed to date, RBI fees will be at most $20 million in 2020 assuming no other assets are sold through the -- though the company continues to execute on its business plans to realize value, so I expect a lower full year figure.Finally, we typically don't discuss quarterly changes in OFFO, but I wanted to call out to specific items that will impact our fourth quarter. First, the equity offering closed last Thursday, but the preferred redemption won't take place until the end of November. As such, we will be sitting on the proceeds for over a month, which will be short-term diluted. Second, our G&A expense assumptions for the year is unchanged, reflecting our expectation that this line item, which nets out mark-to-market of the PRS use, will increase in the fourth quarter and be higher than any other quarter of this year.With that, I will hand a call back to David for some closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you, Matt. In conclusion, the last nine months provide increasing evidence of this organization's ability to pivot to growth. We are now demonstrably ahead of schedule and executing on the operational redevelopment and opportunistic investing goals that underlie our plan to produce compelling growth over the next five years.And with that will be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Todd Thomas with Key Bank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. David, you touched on investments a bit, which was part of the rationale behind the common equity offering. I was just wondering if you could provide a little more detail on investments, talk about what you're seeing and what the appetite's like moving forward.
David Lukes: Sure, I'd be happy to, Todd. First of all, I guess I would mention that the equity offering was really earmarked to replace the preferred equity stack. But it does obviously give us a bit more flexibility. We continue to recycle assets and have been in the market looking for properties. I hate to give too much insight, other than the fact that we're heavily focused on convenience-oriented properties. I think we've got a very good window now into what's available in the market. And we're heavily focused on returns. I think we recognize that our cost of capital has a hurdle to it. And I think that we're able to find properties that can meet that hurdle.
Todd Thomas: Can you talk about what that hurdle is a little bit more and then in terms of the types of properties, so, you mentioned the small shops and the convenience which you highlighted for the property in Austin. Wouldn't new investments I guess have a greater skew towards small shops and then the current portfolio today?
David Lukes: Well, for this particular quarter with one asset purchase that happened to be entirely shops, I can see that's a reasonable question. The reality is, for us to make investments in retail real estate and make money that has double-digit IRR, we need to be format agnostic. I don't think that there's a tailwind for the industry that is guiding us into a certain property type or even certain sub markets. We're really looking for return. And the older the asset classes get, the more there's mark-to-market opportunities or kind of a tenant roster changes that we think can drive value. And that's why we're less focused on format and we're more concerned about red roll.
Todd Thomas: Okay, and just one question for Matt. As we see the anchor leasing kick in here over the next few quarters, a lot of that was for vacant space. The same store expense recovery rate was just over 86% in the quarter, how much more NOI margin expansion should we expect over the next several quarters here as expense recoveries pick up?
Matt Ostrower: I don't have a specific forecast for that. I mean, we do get anchors in particular, you do see a real improvement in terms of leakage of operating expenses. So I would see -- I would expect some margin improvement. I don't think it's going to be monumental.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christine McIlroy with Citi. Please go ahead.
Kate McConnell: Good morning, this is Katie McConnell for Christy. Can you talk about what's drills earlier than expected timing of the anchor openings this quarter and maybe talk about how much of an impact that had on the improvement in same-store guidance versus the lighter unexpected tenant fallout.
David Lukes: Sure, Katie. Good morning. I can give you a preamble by saying that our five year business plan was heavily front loaded by anchor leasing. A year ago to investor day we talked about 60 anchor opportunities. I think Mike did a great job of assembling not only a great team of leasing experts that really can handle the box leasing, but on a legal and construction side, which is really the majority of the work once the deal making happens with a handshake. And we're quite a bit ahead of our schedule that we laid out a year ago. And it was entirely due to much faster permitting process focused effort on the construction and legal teams to get the spaces opened. And frankly, the retailers themselves were very aggressive and wanting to get open in '19. And so we ended up with a bunch of retailers opening it a couple of months earlier than anticipated.
Matt Ostrower: On your variance question, I would say the less than expected tenant fallout tends to outweigh most things. We had a pretty, as we've discussed from the very beginning of the year all the way through now, we've had pretty conservative assumptions about 10 and Fallout. So, 150 plus basis points in your numbers, that kind of being able to eliminate that gradually throughout the year, most of that throughout the year, obviously, has an outsized impact.
Kate McConnell: Okay, great. And then can you also just touch on how releasing spreads to trend it on the box progress you've made today? And how does this compare to what you'd expect with remaining space based on the level and quality of backfill demand you're seeing today?
Mike Makinen: This is Mike. I think, in general, we've been very pleased with the leasing spreads that we've seen on the anchor backfill, and we were expecting those to be pretty impressive, simply because of the mark-to-market that we anticipated, and we anticipate to see positive leasing spreads on the anchors as we go forward as well.
Kate McConnell: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Santos with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Daniel Santos: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit more color on how you're thinking about the capital markets and raising equity in the future.
David Lukes: Sure, Daniel. Good morning. We're a pretty price sensitive group. I think that we recognize that shareholders should look to use to be good stewards of their capital, and I think over the last course of this year, we've kind of proven that to be the case. Remember, we bought back stock at a price of $11.73 back in January, and we issued last week at $15.28. So I think for us, the price sensitivity is an important feature. But if we take action going forward, it'd really have to be for a specific purpose, and in this case, the purpose of taking out the preferred with really no dilution to the common shareholders was a great feature for us.
Daniel Santos: Okay. Should we expect to see more buy-backs in the future?
David Lukes: Well, like I said, we're price sensitive. I would find it strange to discuss buy-backs a week after we issued. But in the future, I think we're always going to be looking at the price of the stock and we're going to be looking at uses of capital that we think are important. So unless the price and the use are tied together, I wouldn't expect us to be announcing anything.
Daniel Santos: Okay. And then just one last question: some of your peers have noted some increased affinity for shopping centers. Are you seeing similar trends for power centers?
David Lukes: Well we haven't sold any properties that would fit that category out of sight centers.
Daniel Santos: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you comment on how the local shop tenants or more so the franchisers?
David Lukes: I'm sorry, what's that? One more time. It's hard to hear you.
Wes Golladay: Oh, sorry. Can you comment on how the local shop tenants are doing more like the sandwich shops and more of the franchisers?
Mike Makinen: I think in general, the answer is they're doing very well. And a lot of it just really stems from the additional traffic we're experiencing from an anchor lease-up. The anchor tenants are really driving heavy traffic and that translates well to the shop tenants doing well. And we've seen that really help drive our increased shop leasing as well.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then looking at your I guess 5-year plan, if we were to do a refresh today, what would be the biggest change based on you're able to access the capital market, you unwound to JV? I guess my assumption would be the $75 million investment would probably be a little conservative at the moment. Is that a fair statement?
David Lukes: I mean I would say that the biggest change from our Investor Day a year ago is simply the pace. We've just been able to execute a lot faster than we anticipated. Remember that the plan was front-end loaded by NOI growth that then feeds into FFL growth, and at this point, we're ahead of schedule on the NOI growth section.
Mike Makinen: I would also say -- you saw us sell Duvall Village this quarter. We announced it last quarter. I would say on the margin when you look at our kind of internal capital planning, you're seeing some movement from spending money on redevelopment into instead using that -- harvesting capital and then recycling that capital into acquisition.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Hong Sang [ph] with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, guys. I guess in your Investor Day last year, you touched on potentially funding your redevelopment pipeline through the sale of mixed-use development rights. Is that still expected to occur?
David Lukes: Good morning, Han. We have a number of projects that are undergoing municipal entitlements. Remember that's kind of the first leg of the stool that you need to prepare a project is to get the permitting for it. Several of those projects moved along pretty quickly, namely Fairfax outside of D.C., and then a project up in Boston and one down in Atlanta. How we execute on those, whether we put capital to work in a joint venture, whether we sell the air rights or whether we do a project on our own really hasn't been decided. I think we'll make that decision the closer we get to having a project that's shovel ready.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: I just jumped on a little bit late, given another earnings call. I'm sorry, this has been repeated. But one of the things that struck me was slower than anticipated bankruptcies. So I'm wondering if that's transitory and something has fundamentally changed in the strip market or if you're still cautious I hark back to your Analyst Day a year ago, and you were pretty cautious. So I'm just wondering things have been pushed out or there has been a fundamental change over the past 12 months that makes you more bullish on the store closure environment over the medium to long term.
David Lukes: Rich, that is a great question. I think we've wrestled with that subject for the entirety of this year. There's a dilemma, and one is that we've curated a portfolio through a spin off down to less than 70 wholly owned assets, and the land location of those 70 wholly owned assets that made them really desirable from tenants. So if you think about that, 60 vacancies we announced last year and we've leased or getting close to concluding the leases about 48 of them, the demand is really strong. And when you combine that with the fact that the bankruptcies and liquidations of the retailer world simply haven't happened to the extent that we would have thought a year ago, you're right. We have to consider whether it's going to simply roll forward into '20 or whether the new normal has fewer bankruptcies. My personal opinion is that retail is still in transition. There are disruptive forces going on in a lot of tenants throughout the sector, and the best defense you can have is really strong property. What we would hope is that even as retailers are repositioning their store fleets, they're doubling down on their best locations, and those are the ones that we think we own.
Mike Makinen: Only thing I would add is just from a budgeting standpoint, if you sort of thing about 2020, I mean we kind of can have this debate about whether we're seeing a wholesale improvement in fundamentals. You should expect that we will remain conservative in terms of how we guide and how we do our budgets. Some tenants are really question marks. They're trying really hard to turn their businesses around. And we've seen businesses do that before and turn themselves around. But then there are some that we think really are especially more of a question of when not if and so you can assume that we'll build a firm out of that into our forecast. So, conservatism will definitely be -- these uncertainties, conservatism will be the theme for our budgeting and guidance process.
Richard Hill: Yes, sure. That's helpful. And the reason I focus on it is -- look, from term investor standpoint that there has been a pretty significant -- differentiator between strips and your cousin the mall sector. Are you seeing a different demand from tenants for maybe more convenient to locate it strip centers than they maybe you saw previously? And is that -- maybe some of the change that at least the markets are pricing in over the past 12 months?
David Lukes: I think, Rich, the change has simply been an increase in aggregate demand across a lot of different product types. If you look at the last quarter's earnings call, we lifted the number of tenants that have leased those 48 boxes is pretty staggering. And there's a very wide range of tenant demand, including services, clubs and traditional retail. So I don't really see a fundamental shift in the type of demand, but we certainly have had much more demand than we anticipated last year.
Richard Hill: Got it. That's it from me. Thanks, guys.
David Lukes: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Florence [ph] from Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the cost of capital discussion. Obviously you issued at a slight discount to NAV, but have paid down the preferred with that. Is that right to assume that you are thinking about your cost of capital as being at or below your cost of preferred that you're paying that down?
David Lukes: I think what we said is that there is a very specific use of capital and at that price, we were willing to transfer the capital stack from preferred to common at that specific moment at that specific price.
Mike Makinen: And the only thing I would add is NAV is a moveable feast, right, at the moment. I think the our band of -- for example, just looking at consensus numbers, our band goes from like $11 all the way up to $18, right, and that's not because the analysts aren't doing their job, that's because there's a lot of uncertainty about what asset values really are. So there is potentially a false precision involved in the NAV exercise. Even if we take the consensus NAV as a given, whatever small amount of dilution, we think it was less than 1% versus consensus NAV, there is a value add to improving our capital structure that we think far outweighs whatever minimal amount of NAV dilution there might have been based on a consensus number, which we're not necessarily blessing. But there is at this point in the cycle in particular, we think there's real value to be added by being smart and de-leveraging in a way that has a very low cost associated with it.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough. The other question I have is maybe if you can give us some comments on where you view right now your mark-to-market in your portfolio. You guys have done a very good job in terms of leasing and I'm just curious how much more can you squeeze out of the portfolio.
David Lukes: It's a great question. I think you know that we have not published a mark-to-market. We really haven't commented on it. And frankly, it moves significantly when you're leasing a lot of anchor space. But I will remind you that when we did the spinoff of RBI, one of the primary reasons was to curate for mark-to-market, and when you combine a high mark-to-market with great underlying land, that means that over time you should capture rent growth in addition to redevelopment opportunities, and in some cases, bankruptcies attendance allow you to unlock the land value that you couldn't previously or otherwise do. So mark-to-market's a really important feature for this portfolio, but we really haven't been specific with marking a specific dollar number.
Unidentified Analyst: Can you guys comment on the on the mark-to-market opportunity for your Dress Barn and Charming Charlie exposure?
David Lukes: We have not committed specifically on the exposure for those. I would simply say that they're a positive mark.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for taking the time to join, and we will speak with you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David R. Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Our 2019 performance is a great start to the five year business plan we laid out at our Investor Day a little over a year ago and I am enthusiastic about our teams focus on execution. Fourth quarter results capped an excellent full year for SITE Centers with same store NOI growth and OFFO significantly ahead of our expectations. Key drivers for the quarter were better than expected property NOI and Lower G&A, which were consistent themes throughout the year as our operations team delivered on revenue and proactively managed expenses.The fourth quarter also included a number of transactions, including the announcement of expected JV from our Teachers sale and $195 million equity offering, along with a significant repayment of our Blackstone preferred investment and three new acquisitions. Each of these actions are accretive to the company's long-term growth profile and position us well for 2020 and the years ahead. I'd like to put my comments on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results into context with the three components of our five year business plan; leasing, acquisitions, and redevelopment. It's these three activities that underpin our 2020 guidance assumptions and the steady growth within the portfolio.First, we are a leasing story. Our biggest opportunity for growth is to fill our valuable real estate with strong tenants. At the top of the list are the 60 anchor opportunities we've been highlighting over the past year. We've now executed leases or LOIs on 43 of those spaces at a blended 38% leasing spread. Our success over the past year was the primary driver of same store NOI growth, the largest component of our business plan, which was 5.1% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The acceleration from the third quarter was boosted by early anchor openings and outperformance versus our budget driven by a number of positive variances. Full year growth of 3.6% was also well ahead of the five year average we laid out at Investor Day, supporting the most important part of this plan. As anchors and shops recently signed start to open and pay rent they'll provide a steady tailwind of growth for the next several years and are a key driver behind 2020 same store NOI guidance of 2.5% and the midpoint of our range, including redevelopment and 1.5% excluding redevelopment. I'm particularly pleased with the outlook considering the difficult comparisons in 2019 and several announced bankruptcies in the first weeks of the year.The second component of our business plan is acquisitions. As a reminder our five year plan calls for $75 million of annual investments funded via capital recycling, a goal we achieved in 2019 through the acquisition of three properties in the fourth quarter. I discussed our vintage plaza deal in Austin, Texas last quarter and I'm now excited to announce two other investments in Tampa and Portland. Both are consistent with vintage, where we expect vacancy and below market leases to produce NOI and cash flow growth well in excess of our portfolio average. Additionally, despite different formats, both properties benefit from adjacent natural traffic drivers. Southtown Center in Tampa, Florida, is a collection of service oriented shops surrounded by top performing Sprouts and Publix grocery anchors in an affluent submarket.The blocks in Portland, Oregon is a bit more unique as is collection of urban retail condos at the base of 10 different apartment buildings in the Pearl district. This submarket at the footsteps of Downtown Portland has seen significant population growth, with 5,800 apartments constructed since 2011 alone. The majority of the leases in our properties, which are occupied by a mix of restaurants, banks, and fitness users, were signed prior to the population growth I described providing a significant opportunity to increase cash flow upon lease expiration.Retail properties with true rent growth are challenging to identify. But our ability to use customer data gives us a much clearer picture of the economic demand for space, and it allows us to be less concerned with the retail format and more focused on retail traffic. Both of these recent investments have very high customer traffic and a proven roll up in market rents. With the scarcity of competition and a measurable mark-to-market on renewals, we are confident that economics on these acquisitions deliver a return that's high enough to warrant our use of capital. We remain optimistic that we'll be able to source additional investments over the course of 2020, all of which will highlight our bottom up format agnostic approach while at the same time be mindful of our cost of capital.Finally, we're continuing to make progress on the third component of our business plan, redevelopment. We started the second phase at West Bay Plaza during the fourth quarter and are seeing very strong demand for the remaining space which will complete the transformation of our center. Tenants are also set to open over the course of 2020 at Venice [ph] and at the collection of Brandon Boulevard wrapping up those projects.Finally, work continues on our pipeline of large scale entitlement projects, and we remain focused on realizing value on these sites, whether it means capturing profits early through a sale, mitigating risk through a joint venture, or executing on our own. In summary, SITE ended the year with a much stronger portfolio of assets, a better balance sheet, and significant embedded cash flow growth, all of which supports our five year plan. I expect 2020 to be another successful year as we continue to benefit from an occupancy uplift driven by strong tenant demand and flexibility to invest opportunistically.Lastly, we were very fortunate to appoint Conor Fennerty as our new Chief Financial Officer during the fourth quarter, and on behalf of all of our staff and the Board of Directors, I want to welcome him to the Executive Team. Conor has a proven track record as an investor and has earned tremendous respect throughout our organization over the past three years with his leadership of our finance and FP&A departments. I also want to thank Matt Ostrower for his incredible contributions to this company and his friendship over the past five years. We wish him well at his next adventure and are sure he will make a successful impact like he did here at SITE Centers. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Mike Makinen to discuss our operating results.
Michael A. Makinen: Thank you, David. I'm extremely pleased with our operational results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Quarterly NOI was ahead of plan due to lower bad debt, bankruptcy settlement claims, higher overage, and percentage rent and earlier rent commencements. Anchor and shop leasing volumes remain robust and we are encouraged about the prospects to backfill spaces occupied by tenants that have recently filed for bankruptcy. Since the RVI spin, we have repeatedly demonstrated that when we get space back from tenants, we can re-lease at a healthy mark-to-market to a diverse group of tenants. We opened four consolidated anchors in the fourth quarter, the majority of them earlier than expected, and now have 25 of the 60 anchor spaces identified at our Investor Day open and rent paying. Another 13 are signed but not yet open and five are in advanced lease negotiation. As David mentioned, we expect these openings along with the backfill of 2019 and 2020 small shop bankruptcies to provide a multi-year tailwind.New lease spreads and net effective rents for the quarter were right in line with our trailing 12 month averages since the spin. Renewal spreads were softer though due in part to several grocery anchors that exercised flat options as well as two short-term renewals of anchor tenants at redevelopment properties which were included in our renewal spreads. As I've mentioned a number of times previously, our smaller denominator will create some volatility in our operating metrics.The lease rate for the portfolio was down 40 basis points this quarter, largely due to the dress barn closures. Strong leasing activity partially mitigated these move outs with our operations team completing the highest quarterly shop volume in two years. Demand for shop space is deep and I feel very good about our momentum. Finally, our commenced rate was effectively unchanged and the 290 basis point leased occupied GAAP provides confidence in our ability to achieve our five year 2.75% same store NOI growth target even with a 1.5% annual average NOI reserve for tenant bankruptcies. With that, I'll hand the call over to Conor.
Conor M. Fennerty: Thanks, Mike. I'll comment first on our balance sheet, discuss fourth quarter and full year earnings, and then close with thoughts on 2020 guidance. First on the balance sheet, our position remains very strong with pro rata debt to EBITDA in the quarter at 5.5 times compared to 6.5 times in the third quarter of 2018, despite the mid-quarter closings of the Tampa and Portland acquisitions. Our maturities also remain in great shape with the weighted average term of 5.2 years. We have significant liquidity as of year-end with almost full availability on our $950 million line of credit and just three of our 70 consolidated properties encumbered as of today.Additionally, we have three other sources of future capital. First is the $170 million of gross proceeds we expect to receive from the closing of the Teachers joint venture in the coming weeks. The second is the $113 million remaining preferred investment in our Blackstone joint venture. We received almost $47 million of the preferred in the fourth quarter with the sale of ESUM [ph] Center as the joint ventures continue to unwind. The third source is the capital we eventually expect to receive through the ultimate liquidation of RVI. We received the second half of the original 34 million receivable in the fourth quarter and have the $190 million preferred remaining. All of these sources, proceeds from Teachers, the Blackstone preferred, and the RVI preferred along with growing EBITDA positioned the company to remain well below our stated long-term leverage maximum of six times net to EBITDA while strategically deploying capital where we find attractive opportunities. That said, as David mentioned, we are mindful of our cost of capital and don't expect to close anything in the near term.Turning to fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. For the fourth quarter as previously mentioned, we benefited from a number of positive variances versus our budget. First, operations were ahead of plan due to the factors outlined by Mike, which were fairly broad based. Second, bankruptcies had a much smaller impact than anticipated and we recognized $650,000 of revenues from Dress Barn and Forever 21, which we did not expect to occur. Lastly, G&A includes a $1.8 million onetime benefit which positively impacted results by a penny. The significant outperformance in the fourth quarter pushed our full year results to $1.27 per share compared to the top end of our guidance range of $1.22. Importantly, results demonstrated measurable OFFO growth from 2018 after adjusting for the impact of spend, highlighting this company's ability to execute and drive cash flow per share.I'll turn now to our 2020 guidance. We're introducing OFFO guidance of $1.10 to $1.14 per share driven by same store NOI excluding redevelopment of 1% to 2% and including redevelopment of 2% to 3%. The same store NOI increase is driven in part by the anchor rent commencements David and Mike discussed, partially offset by a 60 basis point headwind from $1.8 million of bankruptcy claims settlement proceeds received in 2019 and bad debt favorability due to the adoption of a new lease accounting standard. Guidance for 2020 JV fees of $16 million to $20 million is unchanged with the sale of our stake in the Teacher's joint venture, the largest driver of the year-over-year decline. I would expect roughly a third of JV fees to be recognized in the first quarter, with the remaining quarters equally balanced. In terms of RVI fees based on asset sales completed to date, RVI fees will be outmost $19 million in 2020 assuming no other assets are sold. That said, we expect the company to continue to execute on its business plan to realize value so our guidance reflects additional asset sales. Interest income will also be lower in 2020 due to a lower average balance of our Blackstone preferred and the mezzanine loan repayment in the fourth quarter.Lastly, there are a number of moving pieces from the fourth quarter 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. First, weighted average shares will be higher at roughly 195 million due to the fourth quarter impacts on the equity offering. Second, G&A will be higher as we won't have the onetime benefit recorded this quarter. Third, ancillary and other income is expected to be lower by $1.5 million due to non-recurring revenue received in the fourth quarter. And fourth, in addition to typical seasonality that leads to lower NOI in the first quarter we also will not have revenue from Dress Barn, Bar Louie, and Village Inn [ph] totaling $650,000. As Mike mentioned, we are excited about the backflow prospects, but there will likely be limited revenue from these spaces in 2020. With that, I will hand the call back to David for some closing comments.
David R. Lukes: Thank you, Conor. In conclusion, our first full year post spin provides evidence of this organization's ability to grow, take decisive actions, and execute on transactions. We remain ahead of schedule and executing on the operational redevelopment and opportunistic investing goals that underlie our plan to produce compelling growth over the next five years and expect another successful year in 2020. Now operator we are ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, so 2019 was clearly a less impactful year from closures and bankruptcies and I think last quarter you commented that in your view it was more timing related and that you anticipate more transition. So, to start the year we've seen some announcements, perhaps there's more to come but what's your updated view on the health of the retailer environment in general, are conditions improving at the margin, or are they getting worse, what's your sense around the level of retail disruption that you're seeing?
David R. Lukes: Hey Todd, good morning, this is David. I would say that our opinion of the changes occurring in the retail landscape really haven't changed. What has changed is the ones that we thought were risky last year turned out to be less so. And some of the ones that we did not think were risky turned out to be more so. So if you take the surprises to the positive and the surprises to the negative, I think we feel like our stance on the continued changing of a tenant roster continues.
Michael A. Makinen: The one thing I'd add to that Todd is remember at our Investor Day we included a 150 basis points of annual reserve. So we're anticipating more closures or we can absorb more closures over the course of a five year budget. And the exciting part is you'll see years like 2019 where we have very limited closures and you can see outperformance. But in years where there are more closures, we can absorb that and our least occupied GAAP helps us for this year on that front.
Todd Thomas: Got it. And then with regards to that 150 basis points, how should we think about this year if you could maybe help break out a little bit of detail around sort of the budget for the year in terms of the property level budgeting that you've done relative to that additional cushion that might be embedded in the guidance?
David R. Lukes: Sure Todd, I will let Conor speak specifically to the budget. But I would -- I kind of referenced you back to our Investor Day conference which was just a little over a year ago. And what we said at that point in time was that the disruption in retail is going to give this company opportunities. But we should assume some churn and the churn that we have been witnessing allowed us to give a five year plan that included 150 basis points, which was the sum of credit loss and bankruptcy reserve. But that was a blended average over five years. If I were to kind of tilt you towards a thinking process, I think it's fair to assume that on average 150 basis points a year is going to be our budget.
Conor M. Fennerty: And just to add on that Todd, so for 2020 as David mentioned we're using assumptions consistent with the five year plan. So it's 150 basis points of combined bad debt and bankruptcy reserves.
Todd Thomas: Okay, and you recaptured, I guess, a few restaurants. I think you mentioned Bar Louie specifically. Is that tenant specific or are you seeing any concerns or challenges at all in the restaurant sector?
Michael A. Makinen: This is Mike. Those two were somewhat surprising Village Inn [ph] and Bar Louie across the portfolio, the restaurant business tends to be quite healthy.
Todd Thomas: Okay, got it and just a quick last one, the bills that's listed in the supplement, the last tenant on your top 50 is that Bealls a separate entity from the Bealls that is owned by Stage Stores or is that…?
Michael A. Makinen: The Bealls that you're referencing is separate and unrelated to Stage Stores.
Todd Thomas: Got it. Alright, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Christy McElroy with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hey, good morning everyone. Just to follow up on Todd's question in regard to the buffering [ph] guidance, I think we're all in tune with some of the sort of major drivers there, including the management and RVI seeing common, interesting common, there was also the G&A impact. I just -- in terms of sort of reconciling and bridging the gap from that $0.33 in fourth quarter into what -- a much lower $0.20 quarterly run rate next year, just wanted to try to gauge the level of conservatism here in that 150 basis points? And Mike, you mentioned that operations were ahead of plan. Are you being extra conservative here or more realistic, I guess we're just -- I'm just trying to figure out of that $0.33 how much of that is sort of operations and vacancy, which I mean, it seems like your same store NOI growth pace seems pretty good, so just trying to reconcile those two?
David R. Lukes: Hey Christy, it is David. You know, one of the benefits of only having 70 wholly owned assets is that it's easy for us to do bottom up budgeting on every single suite with a lot of frequency. So I would say that anytime we come out with a budget on a portfolio of this size, you can assume that it's based on individual suites and therefore it's a realistic budget. If you look at last year, a couple of things happened number one, the construction team at the company were able to get a number of anchor tenants opened a little bit earlier than we had expected and a lot of that comes down to permitting and asking the tenant to open in their blackout period. So I think we pulled forward some revenue that was a little bit unexpected. But from a budgeting standpoint, it really is a realistic budget for 2020.
Conor M. Fennerty: The one thing I'd add Christy to your point on the moving pieces, the three biggest pieces for next year attributing or contributing to the decline are JV fees, RVI fees, and interest income. And those three pieces alone are about $0.14 of headwinds. So that's really the biggest driver of the year-over-year change. To your point, it's February 13th where we have a bottoms up budget. We feel very comfortable with the budget today. But to David's point, there are a number of other factors, assumptions could change our timing and estimates over the course of the year.
Christy McElroy: And Conor, you mentioned G&A next year but I'm wondering if you could give a range of what's embedded in FFO especially in regard to the how the RVI fee income is changing and sort of your expectations around being able to lower G&A with RVI coming off?
Conor M. Fennerty: Sure. So we talked about 2019 as kind of the trough year for G&A. And so we stopped providing disclosure on that because if you think about the last three years, we are a company in transition. There are a lot of moving pieces and we're trying to provide the investment community with as much clarity as we could provide. For next year, we're not a company in transition anymore especially for this year. I would expect to call it $58 million to $59 million of G&A for the year. And again, we've kind of completed the hand-off of RVI fees and lower G&A. And so I'd expect there'd be that those kind of breakdown or the correlation to lower G&A and lower RVI fees to end in 2020.
Christy McElroy: Okay, and just lastly, I think you mentioned Mike that you do expect more dispositions this year, what -- how are you thinking about sort of the GV asset sales that will continue versus assets that you would sell in the wholly owned site?
Michael A. Makinen: Yeah in the wholly owned site Christy we don't have anything budgeted to be selling. It doesn't mean that opportunistically we might decide to recycle a property, but we're budgeting for wholly owned dispositions. On the JV side it's a little bit out of our hands. The Blackstone joint venture continues to sell assets but really, it's under their guidance and direction. And any of the other joint ventures that have dispositions, it really has more to do with the partner than it does us.
Christy McElroy: Great, okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning guys. First of all, thank you for the transparency on same store NOI guide with and without redevelopment. But I want to go back to maybe the 2.75% same store NOI growth for your five year plan that you disclosed at your Investor Day. I think that excluded redevelopment and obviously redevelopment is a big part of your story. So would you be willing to think about your five year plan for NOI growth, including redevelopment in light of the additional disclosure this morning?
David R. Lukes: Rich, that's a very good comment. You are indeed correct. The Investor Day presentation that presented at 2.75% average same store NOI growth was excluding redevelopment. The reason that we have not talked about a five year plan for including redevelopment as a lot of it depends on whether we're going to invest in the redevelopment assets once we achieve entitlements or whether we're going to dispose of that land and air rights and use it to invest in other properties. So far to date, when we have entitled mixed use or multifamily property we have selected to sell the property, sell an out parcel or ground lease it. And so those have different effects that are pretty dramatic on same store. And so that's why I don't think it's all that wise for us to look ahead over the next couple of years. Having said that, on an annual basis when we come out with guidance I do think it's appropriate that we give you as much clarity as we can.
Richard Hill: Got it, but just to clarify that and add to that, one way or another, total NOI growth should be going up because you're either going to be redeveloping it, which should be a positive or you wouldn't do it or you're going to be having proceeds and you will be able to reinvest those proceeds in other properties or pay down debt or something else. Is that sort of the fair way to think about it? What I'm trying to quantify is there upside?
David R. Lukes: Yeah. I mean, I think of it as if we entitle a piece of property that has real value, if we ground lease it, that's going to show up in same store. If we redevelop it, it'll take CAPEX and it'll show up in the redevelopment inclusive of same store. And if we sell the land and reinvest it in a new property, it's not going to show up in same store because it's not in the pool.
Michael A. Makinen: Yeah, the only thing I would add Rich on that last comment from David, remember the 2.75 was the static portfolio that we owned at the Investor Day. So, one of the things David talked about the three assets we bought this quarter, we're really excited about. And one of the reasons we're excited about it is if we think it's additive to our growth rate. So it will take time for those assets come into the pool, etc. But that's another factor to consider as you think through same store NOI and NOI growth for the whole portfolio.
Richard Hill: Got it. And David going back to some of the prepared remarks and the significant amount of cash that you're coming -- that you have coming in, can you just talk through how you might allocate that cash right now and how you're thinking about it versus paying down debt, buying new properties, or maybe other sources of use of cash?
David R. Lukes: Yeah, I'd love to. We do have an exciting tilt here where I expect us to have some capital. If you look at the last year we paid down debt, we paid down press, we bought assets, and we bought back stock. And I think depending on what we see in the open market, depending on our debt maturity schedule, depending on where the stock is trading I think we'll make prudent decisions. The reality is we've tried very hard to be good stewards of shareholder capital and the amount of shareholder capital that's coming back to this company could be significant which means we need to think very carefully about the acquisitions and where we put money.
Richard Hill: Got it, okay guys, that's it for me. Thanks.
David R. Lukes: Thanks Rich.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. So just a few questions here. First, just going into the guidance and the 150 of cushions that's here for BKs and closings. Is Pier 1 on top of that or is Pier 1 in that 150?
Conor M. Fennerty: So Alex you know Pier 1 nothing's been announced today. There was a publicly disclosed list where we had four wholly owned properties but as of today they're paying rent and we have leases with them. So it's kind of a status quo for Pier 1 today.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, but presumably Conor I mean you guys budgeted something in your numbers, I'm assuming that those foreclosed just to be on the safe side correct?
Conor M. Fennerty: Presumably we're aware of all the announcements to your point Alex and we've done this before and we're anticipating the worst or we can anticipate the worst.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, great. And then on the RVI it seems like the U.S. is fine on the liquidation side. Just curious the update on Puerto Rico, it sounds like it's still a pretty tough retail disposition market, but maybe as you guys look at RVI dispositions for this year you don't need to sell anything from there to continue at a healthy pace liquidation, so maybe you can just give us some framework around peso liquidation and how much of that depends on being able to target the Puerto Rican market for asset sales?
David R. Lukes: Hey Alex it is David, good morning. I really don't feel comfortable commenting on RVI's business strategy or execution. It has a separate board as you know. They do press release and the press releases I think you can look at the pace of asset sales and whether they've been Puerto Rico or U.S. and I think you can make a reasonable judgment about the pace of dispositions in 2020 which is what we do when we look at our internal budgeting.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, and then just finally, I appreciate your comments on that you're not really looking for any wholly owned asset sales, continue to focus on JVs, but you've been acquiring assets that have either all small tenant or predominately small tenant to help NOI growth. So David as you look at what you're thinking about targeting for acquisition, whether it's this year or next year how do you think about these smaller tenant assets as improving the overall NOI growth profile of the company, do you expect that through these acquisitions you grow 20 or 50 basis points of extra NOI that you'll be able to get in the run rate or how should we be thinking about that and what you're looking at?
David R. Lukes: Yes Alex it's a really good question. As you imagine with the amount of capital we might have to invest we've spent a lot of time thinking about how we want to deploy capital. And I've mentioned several times the fact that retail landlords have a lot more data than we all used to have even two years ago. And if I look at the markets today I see low construction deliveries, high development cost, high occupancy levels, and scarcity of good space in wealthy submarkets. As this company SITE Centers starts to get through our occupancy build in the next two years, as you can imagine we're going to become a renewal story. And when you're buying properties and in high income submarkets that are highly occupied, the renewal is really what you're depending on for NOI and rent growth. And that's why we're using a lot of customer data to really look carefully at what each tenant is paying, compare that to other tenants that are similar in the market, and figure out where we can build an NOI growth that's arguably a lot higher than our internal core. We're not specifically avoiding anchor spaces, it's just that as we look to the market and say where can we get real growth, the rent growth is really coming from smaller shops in wealthy submarkets.
Conor M. Fennerty: The one thing I will just highlight Alex as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are format agnostic, right. You'll see us buy a wide range of properties. You're absolutely right, this past quarter we bought three assets that were majority shops but you're likely to see us buy kind of across the retail spectrum in terms of format. We are bottoms up format agnostic.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Just to go back to same store NOI guidance, you guys mentioned in your opening remarks that Village and Bar Louie accounted $650,000 in rent, is that in your budget and the 150 basis points is on top of that? [Multiple Speakers]
Conor M. Fennerty: I missed the first part of your question, you said the $650,000.
Ki Bin Kim: Yeah. Is that on top of the 150 basis points reserve or would that be a rounding out of that reserve?
Conor M. Fennerty: No. So the Bar Louie, the Dress Barn, and the Village Inn that's income we are no longer receiving, that's in our budget. That's not part of the reserve. The reserve are for future bank pursuits that haven't been announced today. So again just to repeat the point Bar Louie, Dress Barn, and Village Inn are in our budget, in our 1% to 2% same store and are not part of our future reserve.
Ki Bin Kim: Got it and can you just comment on any kind of CAPEX trends you're seeing as it comes to tenant negotiations and if there's anything noticeable?
David R. Lukes: You know Ki I think a portfolio of this size it's hard to make any broad comparisons but I'll let Mike answer that.
Michael A. Makinen: I mean as you can see by our reported net effective rents, I mean the CAPEX has remained fairly consistent. The anchor tenants are still expecting similar packages that they were expecting over the last several years. And on our shop CAPEX that remains relatively modest.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, but when I looked at the CAPEX at least the tenant allowance part as a percent of your rent value it does seem like it's creeping higher, I know it's just one quarter but…?
Michael A. Makinen: I think you just -- the answer to it is just one quarter and I think you're going to see a little bit of bumpiness quarter-to-quarter with the portfolio of this size. But aggregately speaking we're not seeing any substantial trends or changes.
David R. Lukes: I mean Ki, one of the things that we always we always like to remind people is that as long as we're in a lease up scenario especially lease up of larger spaces, CAPEX is going to maintain a fairly elevated state. Once that starts to wear thin and the lease to occupy gap closes the company becomes more of a renewal story. And on renewals in high income areas I think you can imagine you're renewing with very little TI which is why our assumption is that our NOI growth is also going to flow through to AFFO growth.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey, good morning. Could you discuss how the Pier 1 closures are being negotiated, are you expecting to get any lease term fees from this or are they using maybe similar to Dress Bran, the threat of bankruptcy to get out of its leases early without paying anything to landlords?
David R. Lukes: Vince I would love to speculate and good morning, but I think I'll withhold simply because we're not under any knowledge that would help us shed any light on it.
Vince Tibone: Fair enough. And then maybe just shifting gears, are you able to share the cap rates on the acquisitions or can you just talk to me a little bit more broadly as well about what you're seeing in the private transaction market today?
Michael A. Makinen: Yeah, sure. Well as a reminder the investments that we made last year were made possible by recycling capital when we did a joint venture with a Chinese institution about a year ago. The proceeds from that transaction were used to pay down debt, buyback stock, and make some acquisitions so that the blended return of all those activities was far in excess of what we think the return is on our stock. Having said that, the acquisitions on their own blended to six cap rate.
Vince Tibone: Okay, great and then just broader -- are you seeing any big shifts in the private transaction market, changes in debt availability or capital interest are pretty similar to the last let's say six months or so?
Michael A. Makinen: And I certainly in the last six months I haven't seen anything that's been noteworthy that the ability to secure debt seems readily available. And we've sold a lot of properties out of joint ventures and so I think we've got a pretty good window on the disposition outlook. On the acquisition side it seems like the larger properties are pretty actively pursued by larger institutions and the smaller properties it's a little bit more of a mixed crowd with some private and some public. But the demand for acquisitions is still pretty steep.
Vince Tibone: Okay, interesting. And one last one for me, could you just share a little bit more additional detail on the redevelopment projects, they are expected to contribute this 100 basis points to same store this year and just to clarify I want to make sure I understand all the major redevelopments are excluded from same store still, is that correct?
Conor M. Fennerty: So Vince the major redevelopment will be included in the same store with redevelopment. And so the assets contributing this year are the collection of Brandon, Vandas [ph] and then the first phase, excuse me, of West Bay.
Vince Tibone: Got it, okay. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.
Conor M. Fennerty: Absolutely.
Operator: The next question is from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay: Yeah. Good morning guys. Looking at the reserve on the preferred equity investment, is that driven by a cap rate assumption change or NOI at the property?
Conor M. Fennerty: So Wes as you know each quarter we mark to market that valuation reserve, excuse me, on the preferred balance and we go property by property working with our transactions and our funds team. I can't recall specifically what drove the $3 million change this quarter. If you recall last quarter we mentioned it was really just an anchor not renewing. Just given the size of that portfolio and the size of our preferred it is really sensitive to input so it's a long way of saying I can't recall what drove it this quarter but it's usually a one or two items that move it. To David's point it's really not a cap rate question. We haven't seen cap rates move. It's typically an operation change.
Wes Golladay: Okay, that makes sense. And then looking at the 17 acres of the 60 that you're still working on, are you actively marketing all that space and then since the Investor Day have you gotten any more anchorage back?
Michael A. Makinen: That's a good question. The answer to are we marketing all of that space, the answer is no. If you look at page 17 of our supplement you'll see some of the major redevelopments have a TBD next to them. In those cases we're sitting on boxes and we're holding them from being leased but they're part of that 60 that we mentioned at Investor Day because we're working on entitlements.
Conor M. Fennerty: And in terms of have we got anchors back, absolutely Wes and there's a normal amount that comes back every single year. It's a point that's not lost on us and it highlights the relevance of the 60 anchors. You know we're excited about the tailwind for next couple of years but they're diminishing in terms of importance and there's other kind of more material anchors that we have that are either in lease up or vacant today. So it's a long way of saying absolutely yes to other anchors that have come back to us in the last 18 months since our Investor Day. And that's kind of part of our normal course of business.
Wes Golladay: And I guess a follow up to that would be for those anchors I expect you would continue to get some back. Is the new rent lease going to be comparable to what you are doing with the 60?
David R. Lukes: Yeah. It will be part of our same store pool and our comp pool for our spreads. And you have seen our new lease spreads kind of hover in that low double-digit area and so they would be included in that pool Wes.
Wes Golladay: Not included but the comparable level like you get from the 60, you highlighted the big pop?
David R. Lukes: Yeah, we have a certain number of boxes come back every single year.
Wes Golladay: Okay thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Hon Sang with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Hon Sang: Yeah, hi guys, just a quick question for me. Just looking at your footnote the notes you give, sorry, same store excluding lost rent related to lease terminations is that basically like the same store excluding bankruptcy number?
David R. Lukes: So Hon the reference there is starting the third quarter of 2019. We provided same store NOI with and without the impact of loss rent from termination fees starting in 2020 to be comparable to our peer group. We are excluding any impact from termination fees, where that's loss rent over the term fee itself and so that footnote was simply a call out to let the investment community know that starting in 2020 again we will have no impact from term fees as well as loss rent or the term fee itself going forward. If you look in 2019 the impact of the loss rent from term fees was fairly immaterial, I think it was about 15 basis points. But again just to improve our comparability to the peer group we exclude all lease term impact for 2020 and onwards.
Hon Sang: Yeah, thank you.
David R. Lukes: You are welcome.
Operator: The next question will be from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Great, and thanks guys for taking my question. Just a question on the 150 basis points of reserve that you have, have you guys -- what's the breakdown between rents -- lost rents as well as cam reconciliations and how is that compared to historic levels?
Conor M. Fennerty: Floris, we haven’t provided that level of detail. What I would just say is we focus on loss revenue. So whether that's base rent, whether that's percentage rent, over rent, cam it's all the same to us, it's loss revenue. The other piece that Dave and I both mentioned is there's a bad debt component. So we saw bad debt. We have a separate bad debt assumption that is related to income or revenue, excuse me, which is cam plus base rent as well. So again we're not going to provide that level of detail, what I would just tell you is we focus on loss revenue which includes all the factors you identified.
Floris van Dijkum: Okay, thanks. That's it.
Operator: Next up is Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, what's your occupancy goals for 2020 and it seems like the lease to occupy narrowed this quarter versus third quarter, would you expect this trend to continue?
David R. Lukes: Linda, it is David. We are very happy with the amount of leasing production out of the team. We had a fantastic year last year. I will say that our goals have more to do with leasing space to the right tenants and we don't have occupancy goals for the leasing team or for the company which is why we really don't mention occupancy goals in the guidance.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then on the renewal spreads understanding there were a couple onetime items and you're more focused on leasing up right now. What level would you expect to generate for renewables overall in 2020 understanding it's pretty volatile?
David R. Lukes: I would expect the overall renewal rate to be similar to what we've seen in the past several quarters. We did have some onetime events this quarter that tended to soften a little bit.
Conor M. Fennerty: And Linda if you remember from Investor Day we talked about a blended spread of 7.5% and the range of 5% to 10%. So we're kind of consistent with our range [indiscernible] basis.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that. And then just one final one, sorry if this is an obvious question but for your separate bad debt assumption does that include spaces where you don't expect a tenant to renew and it might be hard to fill that space right away?
David R. Lukes: No, so that debt is really just about revenue recognition, right. So that's tenants that are in place today that either to Floris' point don't pay cam or don't pay base rent. So it's really a function of existing tenants just sit on the income statement for rent paying tenants. The bankruptcy reserve is a function of tenants that go bankrupt and just stop paying rent.
Linda Tsai: Okay.
David R. Lukes: I'm happy to. If you want I'm happy to talk about that offline as well.
Linda Tsai: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Christopher Lucas: Hey, good morning guys. Maybe a little color on so you've got 25 of the anchors that have begun paying rent. What's your expectation for this year in terms of openings and the cadence of those anchor openings for 2020?
David R. Lukes: Chris, typically as you know anchors like to open around the holidays. So you'll see those back half weighted or back end weighted I should say in the fourth quarter. That's consistent with the trends we saw in 2019 and 2018. You know absolutely you could have some folks open mid-year but the majority will be kind of a back half or fourth quarter waiting.
Christopher Lucas: Any sense as to the number of anchors that will open this year?
David R. Lukes: No, I mean if we have a lease signed typically you'd open up in the same year but there's always folks that have larger build outs, more complicated build outs, or permitting issues that could push it to 21. So the other thing I'd say is we're providing the anchors by count. Within that count there is a wide range of brands, right. So you could have anchors that pay much higher rents in a higher income area. That could be more material than one that pays lower income or lower rent excuse me. So again I think you just see the impact likely in the fourth quarter but you could see some other ones slip as well but count is not what's going to drive growth.
Christopher Lucas: Okay, and then David I don't know if I heard the answer. Did you provide the cap rate for the two assets you described in the investor presentation?
David R. Lukes: I did but I had a long soliloquy before I mentioned it. Yeah, the acquisitions last year all in aggregate blended to a six cap.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then the investment thesis behind the two assets can you describe here, is it mostly below market rent related or is it remerchandising opportunity, what is sort of the driver there?
David R. Lukes: For these two in particular the opportunity is renewal spreads.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then last question for me just last time you guys bought stock back was I think stock was around 11 75. How do you think about the relative value today given the portfolio significantly derisked the balance sheets to much better shape etcetera, etcetera?
David R. Lukes: Well, I agree the balance sheet is in better shape. And I think the company's been de-risked. I do think we do have some complexity still you know, when Conor goes through the sources of capital this year, there's a number of them. And that complexity, I think, can sometimes show up in the discount. So I think, we'll see what happens over the course of the next couple of quarters. But we feel pretty good about the business plan.
Christopher Lucas: Thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: Your next question is from Samir Khanal with Evercore.
Samir Khanal: Hey, Conor, good morning. I'm sorry if I missed this, but I know there's a lot of focus on the same store NOI growth. But when I look at your FFO, I mean I know there's a lot of variability with fee income, RVI fees, I'm just trying to figure out at what point can we start to see a bottom from an FFO standpoint, any color around that would be helpful?
Conor M. Fennerty: Sure. So let me walk you through some of the big moving pieces for 2020 versus 2019. And I think they have applied some color on the kind of future growth rate of the company. So as I mentioned too, I think as Christy JV fees, RVI fees and interest income are about 13% of headwinds. On top of that we've got the G&A or higher G&A and a higher share count, which are roughly two to three pennies as well. And then lower other income in terms fees year-over-year is another call, two pennies. That takes you from a $1.27 to call it $1.09 round numbers. And then from there we have NOI growth. What you're seeing in 2020 and this is something we've tried to highlight over the last couple of years since our Investor Day Samir is the kind of handoff from lower RVI fees to the reinvestment of capital that both David and I have talked about.So it's really going to be a function of when and how we reinvest that capital in the back half of this year and into 2021 Samir. What I would just tell you is we feel really good about our five year business plan and the 5% OFFO growth that we outlined. And so, as you see us reinvest that capital of course in 2020 I think you'll start to see a lot more visibility on 2021 and future growth.
Samir Khanal: So it's fair to assume that that sort of 2020 is the bottom and then that's sort of you will start to see the inflection at this point?
David R. Lukes: I think you'll start to see that growth profile develop over the course of the year Samir, correct.
Samir Khanal: Okay, alright, thanks.
David R. Lukes: You're welcome.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David R. Lukes: Thank you all for joining our call and we will see you either next quarter or at any conference.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, you may now disconnect your lines."
48,SITC,1,2020,2020-04-30 17:00:00,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the SITE Centers Reports First Quarter 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. [Audio Gap]
Brandon Day: Officer, David Lukes; Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties may be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and in the documents that we filed with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call including the FFO, operating FFO, and same-store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release. This release, our quarterly financial supplement, and earning slide deck maybe found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.sitecenters.com. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to first thank my dedicated colleagues at SITE Centers for their remarkable efforts during the past six weeks. Working remotely has been a learning experience for all of us and is certainly more difficult under the circumstances. I'm extremely grateful for everyone's flexibility and dedication to getting our 1Q books closed and our earnings released.In fact, we did have a very good quarter. Our high quality properties continue to show strong growth with year-over-year same store NOI at 3.7%. We had almost 85,000 square feet of new leases signed during the quarter and an additional 479,000 square feet of renewals and options as discounters and service tenants remain attracted to our properties. The value proposition we offer to our tenants falls into three categories. First, low occupancy cost. Second, convenient access to the last mile and the wealthiest ZIP codes in the United States and third, adjacency to other retailers which results in higher customer traffic.Over the course of my career, I've consistently found even during recessions that these three features continue to attract tenants because of the results retailers see in their sales and profitability. What's unique as we hold this call today is that all three aspects of our value proposition and are on a temporary hold but I do believe they will remain true as the country reopens.I'd like to start with some facts this morning about our current operational status and provide some detail on the responses we've taken. We began to see stores closing on March 16 and the portfolio dropped on April 4, at 45% open as measured by base rent. Since that low point we've slowly trended higher such that as of Tuesday we're 49% open including partially open such as Click & Collect and drive-through with the expectation that we will see further increases over the next few weeks as states ease restrictions.Over this time period all of our properties have remained open and operational. Thanks to the wonderful efforts of our property management and leasing teams who have worked to enact protocols in line with local and state guidelines. From a collection standpoint we've currently received 50% of our pro rata rent for April. While not absolute the rents collected are generally from open tenants while those that would held their contract rent are still largely closed. Local, non-credit tenants account for 12% of the outstanding an unpaid April rent. This means that the remaining 88% of unpaid April rent is from national tenants or national franchise unitsOur standard lease language is clear on payment obligations and specifically state that rent must be paid even if a tenant is not able to remain open. After all we continue to pay our property taxes, pay for life safety and maintenance expenses and property insurance costs. We are working with select tenants to defer rent where there's an economic return to Site Centers but we expect to enforce our legal contracts with respect to the obligations of the remaining tenants.We have noticed significant recent liquidity increase among our top retailers. In fact, 14 of our top 50 tenants accounting for almost 24% of our base rent have raised over $24 billion in debt and equity just this month. It is a truly staggering amount of capital raised and it positions our tenants very well for reopenings.As is common during a recessionary period, local stores often seek financial assistance from property owners as they have limited access to short-term financing and many times landlords’ assistance is needed and it's a good solution to help them through a difficult time. When we receive a request from a local tenant a detailed application is completed that shares historical tax returns, proof of required insurance and evidence of cash availability. To-date we have executed 98 payment plans as part of our Site Centers COVID-19 Rental Assistance Program that in aggregate represent 1.9% of our second quarter rent. These payment plans do not modify any other terms of the lease but instead simply defer the rent owed for a few months and are expected to be repaid before the end of the year. We will likely see more applications in the coming months and will make decisions based on the tenant’s financial position and our willingness to extend short-term credit. Remember that this assistance program is based on tenant need and our local shop exposure is only 7% of our total base rent.We are also well prepared to support our own obligations and have drawn $500 million on our line of credit which remains in cash as of today. The cash raised was a precautionary move and we have no near-term uses with just $4 million of property level debt maturing through year end, no planned acquisitions and minimal development obligations. We have worked tirelessly over the past three years to improve our balance sheet and our liquidity and our maturity profile eliminates any near-term financing risk for the company.Our duration was significantly improved in February of this year as we repaid our 2022 bonds with proceeds from the sale of our joint venture portfolio to TIAA-CREF, the result is that we have no bond maturities until 2023.In regards to the dividend, based on our estimates of taxable net income we believe we have significant flexibility with respect to our dividend policy. Recognizing that the dividend is a function of operating cash flow, the Board of Directors is suspending the second quarter dividend in order to provide a company maximum flexibility. We remain extremely optimistic about our company but believe a strong balance sheet is crucial to capitalize on strategic opportunities that will occur as a result of the pandemic.Before I hand the call over to Mike, I wanted to come back to my earlier comments about real estate and its appeal to tenants. Eventually this crisis will subside. I do believe that retailers and the consumer will make daily choices that are different from pre-COVID conditions. However, I also expect our value proposition will remain intact.Our focus group of 70 open-air properties are located in the wealthiest sub markets in the country with average household incomes of over $100,000 which is in the 87th percentile nationally. We offer tremendous access to these customers in a convenient last-mile format. We offer synergies for tenants that have similar customers who will continue to have higher sales when they're grouped adjacent to each other.And lastly, a relatively low cost compared to other forms of distribution will result in continued low occupancy costs for our tenants. In particular, we started to see over the course of 2019 and into 2020 increased demand from [mall] based tenants and I expect this trend to accelerate. These three features will prove to be resilient even as we adapt to the changes that are accelerating in our sector.Mike?
Michael Makinen: Thank you David. In terms of quarterly results the lease rate for the portfolio was down 90 basis points from year-end largely due to Pier 1 closures and the sale of the Teachers portfolio which was 95.7% leased. Leasing activity partially mitigated these move outs, the volume for the quarter was down measurably from our typical pace as tenants paused at quarter end given the pandemic and the move to work remotely. Post quarter activity from national tenants has resumed albeit at a much lower pace. That said so far in April we have two signed anchor leases and are also in active dialogue with a number of other national tenants in the discount, grocery, beauty and financial services sectors. Local tenants in contrast are largely paused and I expect activity will be slow until tenants specific sub markets reopen.Moving to construction activity and tenant deliveries we opened three consolidated anchors in the first quarter almost all of them earlier than expected and have another 10 consolidated anchors signed but not yet open.Construction activity outside of a few select states like California and New Jersey has been largely uninterrupted thanks to our construction teams efforts and we feel confident on meeting our obligations to get stores open. We are working with tenants to make sure they can open at the right time with the right resources in place but within their lease timeline. As part of our steps taken to date we re-evaluated each of our planned and in progress construction and redevelopment projects reducing our pipeline by 46% with no material cost to the company.Removed from the pipeline was our planned project at Shoppers World where we executed a ground lease with the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority on a parcel of land that was in the entitlement phase for a multi-family building. After an accelerated negotiation, the tenured ground lease commenced in the first quarter with no capital outlay and materially better returns with lower risk versus ground up multifamily development.Adjusted for the removal of shoppers world and speculative projects as at quarter end we have just 30 million left to fund on the development pipeline. Conor?
Conor Fennerty: Thanks Mike. I'll comment first on quarterly earnings, the status of guidance and then discuss our balance sheet and liquidity. First quarter results were ahead of budget driven by better operations including earlier rent commencements, higher recoveries and other income and lease termination fees related to the recapture of two ground leases. Included in the quarter but excluded from OFFO were $17 million of costs related to the redemption of our 2022 unsecured notes which was funded in part with proceeds from the sale of our interest in the Teachers joint venture further extending our weighted average duration.Turning to our balance sheet, the company remains well-positioned with pro rata net debt to EBITDA a 5.3 times just $4 million of property level debt maturing in 2020, no unsecured maturities until 2023 and minimum future development commitments as outlined. The lack of material commitments is a pointed differentiation with no significant cash outlays or impact earnings in the current environment.Additionally, as part of our response to the pandemic that David outlined, we drew down $500 million on our line of credit which remains in cash as of to-date and have another $325 million of availability on lines of credit at quarter end. We have no material uses for the cash at this time as I just outlined but felt the liquidity builders prudent in light of the macro environment.In terms of our covenants, just two of our 69 wholly owned properties are encumbered today providing future potential sources of additional capital and substantial capacity on each of our public bond and bank covenants. One item to note our real estate assets and unencumbered assets covenants do not include cash in the calculation. As a result in our earning slide deck we provided pro forma covenants to adjust for the $500 million line of credit draw.Moving to our outlook. We went through 2020 guidance in March and are not providing and updated outlook at this time. There are a few modeling items to consider because of the changing operating environment though, embedded in our initial 20/20 guidance were continued JV and RBI asset sales. Given the dislocation in the transaction markets it is likely that sales volume will be lower than initially expected reducing downward pressure on fee revenue from 2019. Higher expected fees will help partially mitigate the revenue impact from tenant rent referrals or reduced occupancy.There are a few moving pieces from the first to the second quarter of 2020 as well. First, ancillary and other income is expected to be lowered by almost $1 million due to non-recurring revenue received in the first quarter and second we do not expect to recognize revenue from Pier 1 and other previously announced bankruptcies totaling just over $1 million in the second quarter.Lastly, as David mentioned, the board has suspended the second quarter dividend as a result of the impact to our business from COVID-19. Based on our estimate of taxable net income today, no further dividends are required to be paid in 2020 to satisfy our [REIT] requirements which would result in $78 million of additional retained free cash flow.That said no decisions around future dividends have been made this time. We have worked diligently to reposition our balance sheets over the last three plus years and continue to believe our financial strength positions the company to create stakeholder value going forward.With that I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you Conor. Operator we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Todd Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi thanks. Good morning. David, just first question, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a couple of times that your property serve is important, last-mile distribution hubs in good locations and we've seen a sharp increase in online spending here during the last two months and then the rapid acceleration in online grocery spend. I'm just wondering how you see retail evolving a little bit from here? What you're thinking about and talking to your tenants about in terms of retail in the coming months and maybe years as shifts in consumer preferences and they have been accelerated here?
David Lukes: Todd, I think it's the most important question and we certainly spent a lot of time thinking about it. If you look back on the spin that this company performed a couple of years ago the properties that we selected to keep were ones that we felt would be durable and over the long term as tenants in the retail world changed. Because sales were strong and rents were low we would likely see an increased demand for space and that the economics would be increasing over time albeit with some CapEx to make some changes. I think retail has been changing to the online presence for the better part of a decade. I think to-date some of the beneficiaries of that have been a movement of sales out of the department store, some of them have gone online but a lot of them have gone into the discounters and the discounters have been the most prolific acquirers of our space over time.And so I think we've seen a huge increase in demand in the last maybe two or three years for junior anchor space which then prompted a lot of shop demand. What I think is interesting now and you certainly are seeing a lot of increase demand from the internet but even recently a few days ago, I believe Adobe analytics has come out with a report that showed over a 200% increase in curbside pickup.So one of the things that our property management team has been extremely active on lately is the desire for our tenants to make use of convenience not just being proximate to your home but convenience being we have really flexible buildings, we have flexible Site plans. We have flexible curb cuts and so I think what's going to happen as we leave this crisis is that, the consumer I think will have an increased desire for flexible, safe and adaptable transactions. And I do think that that's going to inure to the benefit of the strip centers.There's other trends as well that I'm sure you would agree working from home is actually working and even if a percentage of that -- a small percentage becomes a long term aspect of the American workforce I do think suburban communities are going to benefit from that and I think open air strips will benefit even more. So there's a couple things that are happening but those are a few of the things that we're focused on.
Todd Thomas: Do you think grocers need to rethink and reconsider their real-estate footprints from all this or do you think that the acceleration in Click and Collect and I guess really online grocery spend and delivery has, what kind of impact do you think that that has on the brick-and-mortar side, the retail side in the grocery industry specifically I guess?
David Lukes: Well, the grocery industry was already dealing with the desire to change their footprint in their format. I mean the amount of test cases that have been done to try and figure out how to automate delivery mechanisms were already in full tilt and I certainly think this helps make that become more common.I mean I think it's no surprise that most retailers, well more than half of our tenant roster are thinking actively about what to do with their square footage. The interesting thing about any recession is that you end up seeing less construction take place for new projects. So let's assume that most of our tenants would like to reconsider their footprints and at the same time most of them don't have the opportunity to go across the street to a new construction projects because we're in the older developed wealthier suburbs and so the only solution is adapting their existing footprint.From the mall tenants, I think the malls continue to go to the strips but from the strip perspective I do agree with you and I think that the grocers and a lot of the mass merchants are going to really figure out how to make use of that last mile distribution. Mike do you have anything to add to that?
Michael Makinen: Yes. I would say that one of the things that I think this pandemic has given us an opportunity to do collectively with our grocery retailers is to work together to really look at how curbside pickup, how parking configuration can really benefit the Click & Collect aspect of their business and I think that it has also forced an acceleration of the expertise on this side of the retailer to really drive this part of the business and I think it works well together and I think we worked very well together with our grocery tenants in creating what was a secondary element of their business and pushing it into an area that is really benefitting both of us.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And just sticking with Michael, so leasing I realize a lot of it 2020 lease expirations were either already signed or in motion. Renewals were underway and so forth but can you just speak about how you're handling expirations going forward here? What you're seeing in the market and how those discussions with tenants are advancing?
Michael Makinen: Well, right now obviously this is a completely unique time and we're really dealing with a tenant by tenant and in some tenants where there was a heavy growth momentum we're continuing to have conversations that are relatively normal as it relates to renewals and options that are being exercised. With other tenants it's a different conversation but the fact of the matter is it's all over the board and there's a tremendous amount of variation and how the tenants are approaching it.
Conor Fennerty: Todd just from a financial side, so it's a lot some 2% of our rent expiring over the course of the year and I think it's fair based out of Mike's comments and David's comments around construction that you probably could see a modestly higher retention rate. So it's a long way of saying I think we feel pretty good about our retention and there's really not a lot of kind of rent rolling in the next calls -- 6 to 12 months.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks Todd.
Operator: The next question comes from Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning guys.
David Lukes: Hi Christy.
Christy McElroy: Just in terms of 50% non-payment of rent and a higher amount being anchor tenants, what are tenants saying to you about May and especially given what you mentioned in terms of the liquidity raises that they've been able to do and how close, the store closures of trust? We have heard that some national tenants that may have paid April are saying they won't pay May. So what are you expecting it to be worse or better?
David Lukes: Well Christy, I wish I had a factual answer for you. The reality is we just don't know. I guess we're going to find out next week. I suspect that some tenants they didn't pay in April are going to pay in May and I would expect some of them paid in -- they did not pay in April are going to not pay. So it's really on a case-by-case basis. We've heard lots of rumors and stories and we've heard directly from retailers a lot of different strategies as to how they're dealing with this. So I think from our perspective we're just going to be patient because we really don't know. The normal payment program for rent is out the window. We were receiving April rent as recently as two days ago so and that's obviously 20 days beyond the final due date. So I honestly don't know. It's just going to be a little bit curious for the next week or two.
Christy McElroy: And so, David, I mean you did talk about how rents are due obviously what do you make of the tenants view of the legality behind all of this? What do you feel is the strategy of many of these national retailers that aren't paying? Is it, we will pay you when we can or will pay you when we strike an agreement with you or are they taking a stance that they're not obligated to pay? Because I think there's a lot of confusion out there. Obviously these no long-term contracts and that many tenants are technically into false or will be on these contracts?
David Lukes: Yes. It is a very curious problem and as I mentioned twice in my remarks, this company has paid every bill that we owe. We paid property taxes. In lots of local communities we have paid life safety cost. We paid insurance cost. We sweep the parking lots. We keep the power going. We keep security open. So there's a lot of expenses we're paying that are part of our contracts, the rental payment is supposed to come from the tenants to not only cover those expenses but also other expenses we have.So it's a very curious situation. Like I said, I think that our mindset is to be protective of our covenants and protective of our legal contracts but also a little bit patient that, in times like this when companies are drawing on their lines of credit and no one really knows what the future looks like, I think we have to take a step back and be patient for a couple of weeks. The solution then as you mentioned it's likely to be a variety of outcomes. Some tenants are simply being opportunistic. Some tenants are being protective and some tenants simply can't afford to pay and other ones can and are simply choosing to sit on their capital. So we'll see what happens.
Christy McElroy: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Shivani Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Shivani Sood: Hey, good morning. In terms of the site, they are leased but not yet commenced rent, I think you guys have mentioned that those openings are progressing on the national tenants side. Just curious if there is anything different about how tenants are approaching store openings as we prepare for this sort of new normal situation going forward?
Michael Makinen: Okay. This is Mike. As I mentioned we have 10 executed anchor leases in our consolidated portfolios yet to open. That ranges from tenants like PGA Superstore, Burlington Lidl, Marshalls, Home Goods, Dollar Tree and the good news is that in spite of the pandemic we've basically been able to continue most of our construction activity on schedule in the majority of the states. I mentioned, New Jersey and California are exceptions because these states have placed a moratorium on construction activity.So there's a handful of RCDs in those states that will see some delay but as for the most part we expect to see rent commencements occur but in some cases with slight delay.
Shivani Sood: And then you guys have a fair amount of exposure to states that are starting to open back up [indiscernible] Florida, Texas. I recognize that it's very early still but can you give us a sense for traffic that you have seen over the past few days at some of these a shelter-in-place restrictions have lifted since April 4 trough that was mentioned.
David Lukes: I will let Mike provide some color but it's so recent, I guess we could say that it's an infinitely higher percentage increase from when nobody came but it's nice to have some stores open. Mike, if you want to add anything.
Michael Makinen: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is that we really are in a very early stage of this and the tenants are being particularly cautious with regard to social distancing and meeting all the guidelines of running the business and there's still a lot of customers who are just deciding whether they're ready to go, get their nails done but at the same time traffic is picking up and Atlanta is really has been our area where we focus.
Shivani Sood: Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Christy's question on the rents and rent collections and the point about these are contractual obligations. So how do you guys work to make sure that tenants realize that this can't be their permanent go to the figures -- have this arbitrary, right? And at the same time if you're not getting paid let's say by half the tenants, why wouldn’t you not pay half of the property tax? I mean it seems odd that as a landlord you guys shoulder the whole burden, it seems to be a shared burden, so how do you make it clear to the tenants that they don't they haven’t just gave this arbitrary right and how do you make it so it's not the company and shareholders that are, and your employees who are burdening, who are bearing all the burden that this is a shared cost not only among tenants but also the community because that's ultimately where it is. You guys can only do so much which you are.
David Lukes: Good morning, Alex. Yes, I agree. I'm not sure how to be more specific. Look our business we are lenders. We borrow from the unsecured market and we lend space to retailers for long term contracts and you're asked of how do you make a tenant understand, I think that’s the legal contracts are pretty specific and they're not hard to decipher, even without a law degree. So I think everyone understands it but look, like I said before I think patience is warranted right here. We have a highly unusual circumstance and I think in that aspect the best strategy is just to be patient for a few weeks until the smoke clears.Once the reopening continue we'll all have four corners around what was not paid and at that point I don't have any interest in waiving our contractual rights. I think our stakeholders deserve to have those contracts supported but I also recognize that in some cases there are financial benefits to the landlord and the tenant crafting a solution that gives both of them something they need.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Yes it just seems to be a tough situation --
David Lukes: It's definitely a tough situation. It definitely is, I mean it's – in my career I've never seen it before. It's very-very strange.
Alexander Goldfarb: And what happens if you just withhold property tax, I mean if people aren't paying you why do you have to be obligated to pay others?
David Lukes: Well, the two are tied theoretically but realistically we have obligations to local communities. The communities, teachers and firefighters rely on our proper taxes and we have no intent on reducing our own obligations to those communities. So I know that they are theoretically attached but I don't think two wrongs make a right in this sense.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just going to the dividend suspension in your comments that you don't have to pay for this year. So is the sense that really, it was a transactional income that was driving the taxable income that was driving the dividend through this year or is it the expectation that you're not going to get paid sufficient rent this year to even hit that threshold because it sounds pretty early in the year to say that you've already satisfied the full year? So I'm just trying to understand if it's more transactional income that would have driven taxable or if it's your expectation of the decline in the rental income that's driving the taxable reduction?
David Lukes: Yes, Conor can give you some detail behind that.
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Alex remember the fourth quarter you have a little bit of flexibility, not a little bit you have flexibility on when you declare, when you pay and when you include that dividend in which particular year meaning you can roll your fourth quarter dividend from 2019 to 2020 and the second thing is when you declare and when you pay dividend also gives you flexibility. So when we declare the fourth quarter dividend even though it might not be paid in 2020 it could be included in our taxable income payment.The second thing just to clarify, I would just say is taxable income is based off contractual rent so just because a tenant doesn't pay us does it mean we will decline or have to decline in taxable income but using those two items meaning when we declare and pay for the fourth quarter ‘19, fourth quarter ‘20 gives us that kind of clarity on our taxable income for the year. It's really not related to transactions.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
David Lukes: You're welcome.
Operator: Next question comes from Ki Bin Kim of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks a lot and good morning guys. Just a couple of questions regarding the 50% rent paid and your comment about executed deferrals representing 2% of 2Q, ‘20 rent. What is that implying about the remaining 48% and from my very practical standpoint and imagine is very difficult to go through all the requests and the short time frame. So where are we in terms of that like did you actually, how much progress have we made and actually going through this deferral request?
David Lukes: Hey Ki Bin good morning. It's a great question and I could see how you would connect the dots by saying okay if you're at 1.9%, you haven't received 50, how much longer of a program in this. The reality is any landlord is going to look differently on national credit, when you have a large portfolio of the same brand versus a local shop in a local community. For our portfolio of 69 assets, our local shop exposure is 7% of our total.The payment plans are part of that 7%. So when a local shop just simply doesn't have the financial wherewithal to make it through two or three months of closures, then it is sometimes in our best interest to help them by deferring rent and this is a pretty well worn path, I think in every recession that I've been involved with. This is the playbook that you pull out. You're working with your local tenants. If there's somebody you want they've done well over the last 10 years, they've always paid their rent on time, it's a very easy and elegant way to help them through a tough time but then you get paid back usually within three to six months.That is not the same program that one with entertain for a large national tenant, simply because most of these national tenants have a higher degree of liquidity than we do and they're the ones that I think are going to have a much easier time opening. They have logistics and supply chains and furloughed employees and they have a method for getting back and opening their store. So I don't think the 2% works its way into the 50 category. I think the 2% is really part of that 7.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. So you kind of answer some of this but what percent do you think of the 50% of tenants that didn't pay, would you categorize as opportunistic in nature?
David Lukes: I don't even know how to answer that. I know you are asking but the half of the stores are closed and while it's not a perfect overlap about half the stores have paid. So opportunistic I think probably depends more on their own financial position. I mean there are some tenants, particularly some of the entertainment ones that I think have asked for some assistance and there's some validity there because it's difficult to see some of these tenants surviving a couple of months.On the other hand we had a grocery store that does over $100 million in gross sales ask for rent assistance and they've been open. They haven't closed a day. So I think there are a number of tenants that are being opportunistic and I guess you can expect that. It's unfortunate because to Alex's point we're paying property tax. So it is unfortunate but it's part of the business.
Ki Bin Kim: Well, I'm sure those tenants are the same ones getting the forgivable loans from the government too. Thank you.
David Lukes: Probably.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian [indiscernible] of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Just one for me. Do you guys know or have an estimate of how many of your tenants have access to the paycheck protection program and then can you talk about how successful they have been getting it?
David Lukes: Brian, we don't have great data on that and part of the reason is that our portfolio is heavily weighted towards national credit. So if you think about only 7% of our ABR is from small shop tenants, the only time we have visibility as to whether they applied for a paycheck protection program is if they apply with us for some rental assistance and then we require them to sign an affidavit saying that they have applied to the program with the Federal Government. So we have a few that we've been able to log but we really don't have great data on that.
Conor Fennerty: Brian, the more impactful program for us just given our national exposure to David's point is the federal reserve's involvement in the IG and the high-yield markets. So David referenced that 14 of our 50 tenants tapping the equity or debt markets. That is more impactful for us just given our national tenant exposure.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Hill of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning guys. I just want maybe transition away from April, May and June and think about the longer term. One of the things that you guys have highlighted in the past was the amount of the lack of better term cash that you're going to be getting in from either RVI fees, the wind down of Blackstone JV and then some preferred payments as well. That can be rather substantial certainly as it relates to the value of your market cap right now. What are you thinking about with that cash right now? Do you see this environment as a really big opportunity to go by distressed valuations? Are you going to do special dividends? Are you going to pay down debt? How are you thinking about it in this environment versus maybe six months ago?
David Lukes: Good morning Rich. Well, I think the three categories you mentioned the RVI fees, we were assuming would be reduced over the course of 2020 because our assumption was that company is, is selling their assets as fast as they can and our fees are based on the AUM and so eventually our fees would decline. Since the transactions market are pretty much on hold right now, our assumption is that the RVIs will stay higher for a little bit longer and so that's a little bit more cash in the 2020 than we budgeted.With respect to the Blackstone [CREF]and the RVI [prep] you're right the two of them together add up to $160 million or $170 million. I'm sorry $260 million, $270 million. We're not at the point that we're thinking about how to allocate the investment if we get those proceeds back. We are more interested in receiving the proceeds and again those both are results of the transaction market which is really slow. So we don't really have great visibility as to when we get the two preferreds back but we do still feel confident that we eventually will.
Michael Makinen: And Rich, just to add to that when we've got a dollar in the door historically we look at all of our alternatives which prior to this was a share repurchase, redevelopment, paying down debt, acquisitions. That calculus or that equation doesn't change with this. So if one of those came back in we would go through the same exercise and same math. Probably today liquidity and cash are probably the highest value for us but that will depend on where our share price is, where our bonds are trading and what opportunities we see in the market.
Richard Hill: Sure. I think that's helpful. Maybe not as much detail as I wanted, but I appreciate the response. Hey, going back to the portfolio that you actually own right now, you have a carefully curated portfolio post RVI spin. One of the things that you talked about in the past was maybe having a portfolio that intentionally had some exposure to lower quality tenants because there was a mark-to-market opportunity. In a way does that provide you maybe more growth so the upside now in this environment than maybe some of your peers or do you think it's tougher sledding than you were previously expecting?
David Lukes: I think that the business plan of selecting the highest quality real estate with the best mark-to-market was a good strategy and it remains kind of a firm benefit to us over the course of time. I mean the real question is, is the normal state of disruption in retail increasing and I'd say the answer is probably yes and so yes I would expect that we would have more near term gains but there's a cost to that. There's a CapEx cost to recycling tenants at a faster pace. If you think about our five-year business plan we had assumed a bankruptcy process that would continued at fairly high rate and this is probably going to even accelerate that.So I think it's pulling forward a couple years of bankruptcies I would assume to the near term. So I look forward to recycling some real estate and being able to raise rents but I think it's going to come at a much bigger Hill and because of that I think the current point our liquidity and our ability to conserve cash right now is a pretty important feature.
Conor Fennerty: And Rich, the value, to David’s initial comments in opening remarks, the value proposition of our real estate remains we think as we come out of this. So you take that and dovetail with Mike's comments around demand from the discounters from grocery, from beauty. I think we feel really good about those backfill opportunities and still think that mark-to-market remains in place. To David's point it might be quicker that being said we're still excited about that opportunity to backfill with better tenants prepared for the future post-COVID and to Todd's comments maybe with a higher Click & Collect percentage whatever might be.
Richard Hill: Yes. Conor, that's an important point. What I was trying, was driving at was it sounds like the business plan remains firmly intact. It's just been pushed out a little bit.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. I would agree.
Richard Hill: Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate your time.
Operator: The next question today comes from Vince Tibone of Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Vince Tibone: Hey good morning. Since there's a lot of negotiations taking place with tenants, Middle East, how are you thinking about trading offs, a period of maybe rent abatement in order to remove owner restricted clauses in a lease that could potentially have a greater long-term value to Site than that period of free rent?
David Lukes: Hey good morning, Vince. It's a great question. Right now all of our activity has been on assisting small shops because they're the ones that need it over the short term which is why we've arrived at those 90 or 100 payment plans for some other small shop tenants. We have not done any national anchor portfolio resolutions where it's a horse trading. In my opinion it's just too early in the process. Over the course of the next month I do think there will be a lot of conversations about, hey we need this and we can help you with that and to your point there are things, in leases that are somewhat restrictive on landlords especially the older leases that had prohibited and restricted uses, options that could be triggered. There's lots of ways that a retailer could make an offer to a landlord to trade a short term gain for a long term gains with the landlord and we would be open to that but at this point we're not really engaged in those dialogues.
Vince Tibone: Interesting. Fair enough. I’m just [indiscernible] relationship aspect to working with some of your national tenants to where, maybe the landlord to grant rent relief or provide some force trading, or get favorable treatment down the road in terms of the next leasing deal? Is that something that crosses your mind? Is it something you consider?
David Lukes: Well, I think any time there, I mean in any business between the customer and the supplier there's always a relationship and in many cases in this category there's some long-standing personal relationships between deal makers on both sides but I don't think that those relationships [indiscernible] our commitment to our stakeholders. After all our equity and our debt holders are the ones that have entrusted their capital with us and they've done so based on contracts that we've negotiated. So while the relationships make it sometimes more difficult to have hard conversations both sides, both tenant-landlord are both going to be protecting their own stakeholders at the same time.So we're not interested in forgiving rent simply for the sake of a relationship. What we are interested in doing is helping our tenants get back open and if that means that there are some things that they need and that they're willing to give in order to get them open as a team then I think we're open to that.
Vince Tibone: That's helpful color. Interesting to see how it plays out. I have one more question, just maybe shifting gears a bit. If you can give me just without talking about any individual tenant, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on how you think a retailer bankruptcies could play out this year in terms of chapter 7 versus chapter 11? Like do you think the lending environment is supportive in terms of giving some retailer the chance to reimburse or do you think that companies who may be run out of liquidity could be forced to liquidate, where maybe say normal times, it would be given a chance to restructure their business and keep a lot of their stores open?
David Lukes: Well, what's interesting is that for the last three years, I think we have been saying that retailer bankruptcies are simply a part of our business. Retail is changing. If you have great real estate, you're going to have to adapt and try and increase the profitability of our own properties as tenants liquidate. In this environment, what I find fascinating is that it is notably different than the great financial crisis.I mean a great financial crisis was a time when bad things happen to tenants that had bad business plans. You had too much debt, you had thin margins then a financial crisis tipped you over. In this market, it's a little different. We're seeing bad things happen to really good tenants. They have good business plans. They have good balance sheets. They have good value propositions. They have great brands and they have no sales. So in that aspect I really do believe that we're going to see more reorganizations and fewer liquidations than we did 12 years ago because the dip financing private equity, I think they see the value in some of these chains and these brands and I think that they're going to try and make sure that these changes in these brands come out on a better footing financially.
Vince Tibone: No, that's interesting. Thank you. That's all I have.
Operator: The next question today comes from Mike Mueller of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Hi. I have two questions. First, do you have a sense at this point about the percentage of that local ADR that you just may not reopen? And then the second question is what trigger are you looking for to pay back the money that was drawn down from the credit line that you're sitting on?
Michael Makinen: Yes, good morning. We really do not have any more information on which ones can and cannot open. It's just too early in the process. It's only been frankly a couple of weeks. So we'll see as it comes out and with respect to the balance sheet I think Conor probably has a pretty good answer to the line.
Conor Fennerty: Yes Mike. I think it's too early today. We obviously are sitting on the cash and there is a cost, I'm sorry we have the [indiscernible] on the line. There's a cost to that. At this point I don't think we're in any hurry just given that we think the benefit of keeping excess liquidity outweighs the cost but it's certainly something that's the top of mind for us. I don't know. We will update you as day go forward but it just feels a little early right now.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Samir Khanal of Evercore, please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: David or Mike, I guess the leases that are being negotiated today, I mean what are the tenants are asking for in these spaces that you didn't see a few months ago? One of the questions we've done is their COVID language being incorporated in leases? What if there's a possibility of a second wave coming in, I mean in terms of virus. I guess what's different today than a few months ago in terms of the agreement?
Michael Makinen: Hi Samir, this is Mike. Right now the leases that we're working on are leases that are in the relatively advanced stage and provisions and items related to COVID have not entered into those conversations but we're waiting and seeing what's going to happen over the next several months as to how that's going to going to play out.
Samir Khanal: Okay. And I guess my second question is on bankruptcies just for you Mike. Do you get the sense that a lot of the restructurings and bankruptcies could get pushed out in the next year because I just get the sense that a lot of the retailers can't hold sort of going out of business sales at the current moment. Just trying to get a picture of bankruptcies maybe later this year or even into next year?
Michael Makinen: I will let Conor speak to that one.
Conor Fennerty: Yes Samir, it's a good question. I don't know, I mean I don't think banks is not something really push all off. So I don't think there will be a pause. I think you could see frankly once you have a reopening and increase ahead of the holidays as either some retailers struggle to liquidate their inventory or buy inventory at the holidays. So I don't think there will be a pause but it's just a guess. As you know the bankruptcies that are in process the model of the Pier 1, etc. are effectively on hold until you see some sense of reopening but our citations today with prior comment there will be more bankruptcies [indiscernible] pull forward. So I don't see a pause but it's just the best guess, it's a guest at best excuse me.
Samir Khanal: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum of Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions. Your bad debt reserve wasn't as that much different from the first quarter of last year. What are your expectations going forward and in particular also in terms of some of the straight lining of rents of potential dubious tenants so, do you expect that, those charges will probably likely increase in the second and third quarters?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Floris, it's Conor, how are you. I understand the genesis of your question on bad debt and it's really hard to compare companies and it's an apples and oranges comparison. What I would tell you is, I feel really good about a receivable balance and in our collection process. We've got a great property accounting and property reporting team that's on top of their game.So I understand the genesis to your question. We did have increase in bad debt versus our budget and took some reserves on some tenants that have receivables, excuse me, we were worried about. On a go-forward basis, I think you're going to see less variability in bad debt over the course of the year then you will just simply see tenants go on cash accounting or the cash basis of accounting.So I'm not expecting a material increase and write off. Our receivable balance in a year of your basis is down modestly from a year-end perspective or a [indiscernible] perspective we’re well ahead of over last year we do a great job there as I mentioned. So I don't expect to see a massive uptick in bad debt. I think what you'll likely see is more change on non-cash tenants moving to cash basis of accounting.In terms of your straight line rent question we took some reserves this quarters as we outlined in our deck. Our straight-line rent reserve or receivables is down modestly year-over-year. You are absolutely right could you have further write-offs, it's TBD we're very early at this pandemic as we mentioned and we'll see you as we go from here but we took a modest reserve this quarter and we'll see as we approach next quarter.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks Conor. One more question and this is maybe one for David as well but in terms of your capital, I mean suspending a dividend basically saves $150 million. You've got ample liquidity. You've got a very strong balance sheet, no maturities, strong cash position. What would make you be more aggressive in terms of repurchasing shares given that they're trading at just above a third to the level that you issued equity at the end of 19?
David Lukes: Well first of all remember that the board has only suspended the second quarter dividend. So I wouldn't take that necessarily as an annualized impact but I hear your point that we do have a tremendous amount of liquidity right now there, the balance sheet is in great shape and if we wanted to be aggressive on allocating that capital there are a variety of things that I would find interesting.Certainly our stock is interesting but given the fact that we've drawn our line and we're kind of in a little bit of a defensive posture right now which I think is appropriate, I don't see that being a reasonable idea and I'm more interested in what opportunities arrive as we come out of this COVID crisis but most likely are in the middle of then of a recession because that's the point in time where sometimes a really great real estate can dislodge from existing owners and we can buy vacancies and we can buy properties that we think we can work at and we can grow our company. So I think all options are on the table. Once we have paid back the line and feel like we're in a position that we can be aggressive but for right now I think prudence is probably pretty reasonable given that the country is still closed.
Floris van Dijkum: Great. Thanks Dave.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi good morning. The 50% of the rents that were receive does that cover the monthly fixed costs like operating expenses, G&A, debt service and CapEx?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Linda it's Conor. So breakeven effectively is 50% pre-CapEx and so you're correct we cover interest expense G&A, OPEX, etc. Our CapEx to the first quarter was about $12 million in the leasing CapEx sign. So if you extrapolate the April payment trends for the rest of the quarter in a hypothetical scenario we would have a cash burn of about $12 million if you assumed leasing CapEx is the same for the second quarter as well. For us breakeven is probably about mid-60s. The point I would add to that is there's two points I would add to excuse me, one that's including the $500 million of additional line balance. So there's an interest expense component to that and the second point to David's remarks we're still collecting rent on April and we're in conversations with tenants on potential deferrals or whatever might be to Vince's questions. So in an absolute basis yes we're covering all of our fixed expenses ex-CapEx today but I would just say that it's still really early. As David mentioned we're still early negotiations or conversations with tenants and we'll go from there.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that. And I just had one more. On your earlier comment that bankruptcies will start to accelerate and there will be higher CapEx associated with recycling. Would you expect CapEx expense space to increase because there's more competition to attract the higher quality tenants? What was that just more about aggregate spending some general due to higher turnover?
Michael Makinen: Yes I really just meant the latter. Linda, if you look at the last three years for us our CapEx spend has been elevated simply because we were doing a lot of anchor leasing. Our expectation was that we were going to conclude that anchor leasing and then the CapEx would start to decline which means that we likely then would allocate capital to other activities like external acquisitions or stock buybacks and if what is accelerated is additional churn in the tenant base then it means that will be reallocating capital again to leasing which is a very profitable way to invest money but I would have thought it was a little bit slower every year and I do think that we're going to get a little bit more of a wave here in the next year.
Linda Tsai: That's it for me. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Lukes: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question is a follow up from Christy McElroy of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, it's Michael [indiscernible] with Christy. I was wondering you can talk a little about any differences that you're seeing between your joint venture portfolio and the core wholly owned portfolio and whether there's any differences in terms of rent collections between those two pools? And then also talk about the capitalization from a balance sheet perspective you've moved SITE Center’s corporate balance sheet to largely be unsecured and have also reduced the level of preferred after the equity offering December but the joint venture portfolio is largely secured with a higher level of indebtedness relative to value and so I don't know if there's potential default issues on that side given what is likely a similar level of rent paid but can you sort of walk through some of that for us?
Conor Fennerty: Hi Michael, it's Conor. You're absolutely right sort of secured debt effectively is entirely with the JVs. There's a couple things I point out. So one the JVs have enough cash on hand to cover interest expense for now that could be a risk down the road if this continues or worsens from here. But as of today we feel good about the capitalization. The second point I'd make as you know we've selected partners that are incredibly well capitalized. So the largest insurance companies in the world, largest asset managers in the world, other investment managers with significant capital.So I feel really good about our capitalization there and the third point I would make is that debt is non-recourse. There's no cross-default provision. So we'll do what's best for stakeholders but the leverage and the attachment point really varies dramatically across the joint ventures. So we do have some joint ventures with no leverage. We have others with 30% or 40% LTV and some with higher specifically in the Blackstone portfolio but what I would tell you is that the JVs themselves remain well capitalized. They have cash on hand and they've got enough to cover interest expense for now.
Unidentified Analyst: And the collectibility between the two pools of assets were similar or different?
Conor Fennerty: All over the place. So what I would tell you is some of the joint ventures had higher collection rates, some had lower. It really depends on property type Michael. So we're seeing marginally higher collection rates in the kind of community or smaller centers and then for lower collection rates on the lifestyle side and that really just depends on which joint venture you're referring to but for largely if you're power you're generally the collection rate that we've seen, if your community you've seen marginally higher and then lifestyle is just modestly lower and the joint venture is kind of a smattering of each of those depending on which one you're referring to.
Unidentified Analyst: And then if you think about the 50% non-payment of April rent, you have about 7% of your income is in ground leases. Did a 100% of the ground rent get paid and then effectively if that's the case that would imply a much lower collection rate on the actual storefront. So if you can just clarify that would be great.
Conor Fennerty: Michael, I don't know the collection rate on the ground leases. We'd have to come back to you on that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then do you have on that 50% sort of the number of tenants that that comprises? So if you think about your tenant base, your top 10 tenants are making up almost 30%, your top 50 tenants are 60% of your rent what is the concentration of that 50% non-payment? Were there some larger ones in that bucket or were they dispersed in conjunction with the way your rent roll is?
Conor Fennerty: Yes just given, Michael, the size of our portfolio just for contacts our top 100 tenants are almost 75% of our rent. So not surprisingly it's fairly concentrated. So you're absolutely right.
Unidentified Analyst: And then as you think about the sectors of that non-50% payment, I assume you've called out the restaurants, fitness and theaters which is 11% of your base rent which sounds like those are all donuts, zero payment. What else makes up the remaining 40 percentage points?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. So if you look on slide 8 of our earnings deck Michael, we've got in there the percentage of AVR open by category. As David mentioned in his remarks it's not a perfect correlation but generally the tenants that are open are paying rent. Tenants that are closed are not paying rents. So you're spot on the three that we called out not surprisingly are lower payment kind of categories but if you look on that slide it's almost perfectly correlated with payment and so to your exact points restaurants, it's fitness, it's it's entertainment i.e. theaters for us and at the other end spectrum it's the warehouse, clubs, gas stations, groceries that are paying rent.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Last question just David if I go back to your three core tenants of building the new site centers portfolio which you talked about the low occupancy costs, the convenient access, the last mile and also being the wealthiest zip codes in the U.S. and then the adjacency to which your other retailers provide resulting in the high consumer traffic. You feel like your portfolio is better positioned and a better quality. I guess with that mindset why do you think you are suffering basically in line if not from at least an early read a little bit less rent collection relative to industry if you fit those three qualities?
David Lukes: Well it appears and good morning Michael. It appears that a number of tenants have decided to simply not pay across their entire store fleet and so I guess we haven't really felt like it's pointed at any particular portfolio. We feel like the chains that have decided not to pay rent have just decided nationally not to pay rent and it's not a surprise that our portfolio is filled with more national tenants and we have a smaller shop exposure. The one thing to consider is a big question for us is when do these tenants pay rent given their contracts, why haven't they those are all valid questions.On the other side is these tenants have raised a lot of capital. They have survivability they have cash in order to reopen and what I would suspect is it's the undercapitalized small shop tenants over the next six months that will really struggle because that's what happened in 2008-9. There was this four to six month lag with shop tenants where they kind of continue to pay the bills, they continued to stride and stay open but if they're in a recession particularly if you're in lower income or moderate income markets where the job loss is higher it's very-very difficult for small shops to stay solvent whereas I think the large national chains albeit punishing landlords at this point but I think in the long run they're able to get open again and so I think that trend might reverse.
Michael Makinen: The other thing I might add to that as we have not -- to David's point transactions with any of the national retailers on for the rent and that could obviously have a material impact just given how concentrated we are on the April payment rates.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. Do you think and I respect you and Mike and many within the SITE Centers organization have long tenured deep relationships with these retailers. I can remember a time where DDR used to have, it was like over 800 assets it may have gone over a thousand at one point where you as an entity were the tenants largest landlords in many cases. Do you think size in terms of landlord size is cool when we come to the other side of this will matter in terms of where rents ultimately get paid, how much rent gets paid, what stores retailers will keep that there will may be a separation between sort of large versus more smaller, more niche oriented players?
David Lukes: I think that the size of the landlord mattered a lot when the large landlords had big development programs that serviced a roll out of large national chains. That was a symbiotic relationship that seemed to mean that size mattered. A retailer that wanted to open 50 stores a year to go to their top landlords who were also developers and merchants builders and you could fill your open to buy simply by a handful of really big national relationships and that was sometimes private and sometimes it was the REITs but honestly I don't really see the retail world as having a tremendous footprint growth.It's more about reallocating footprints in the higher density and higher income sub-markets and in that sense I think the landlord matters less. So I personally feel like shrinking as we did to concentrate on five dozen properties was the right move because we can really be very-very granular on every single lease decisions and it's not overshadowed by a relationship that we have with a tenant that has a big rollout program and in that sense I think we're always going to do what matters to our stakeholders which is our debt and our equity holders.
Michael Makinen: The only thing I would add Michael, this probably better than we do is I think it's the strip's. The public strips represent 10%- 15% of the shopping centers in United States. So it's a little different than the malls where how concentrated they are. So it's not to say that we're not relevant and then the retailer's don't know who we are but it is definitely extremely fragmented and remains that way.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for all the time.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwaof Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Steve Sakwa: Thanks. I just had really one question maybe for David or for Mike just you made a comment about mall tenants and I'm just curious if you could maybe expound on either the categories or the pace, if there's any names or things that you could just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing and how that might unfold over the next six to twelve months?
David Lukes: Good morning Steve. I mean, I guess I would refrain from giving a tenant names but even the last year I think we've seen, health and beauty in particular recognized that their customers are coming to strips and Mike can give a little bit more detail but I really do think this was heavily influenced by the ability for tenants and landlords to access geolocation data. The cellphone data that you're able to aggregate now can give you such an incredible window into who's coming to your properties.A lot of the mall based tenant and that's why I bring up health and beauty realize that their customers were not just going to a mall, their customers were also going to strip centers and because of the convenience for their customer in the strip versus the mall that was a big draw and then they look at the occupancy cost ratio. I'm sure you saw the analysis between GAAP at Old Navy when they started to show their profitability and you look at the occupancy cost ratio between those two different brands it's remarkably less expensive to be in a strip format and so I think what we were starting to see last year because of the geofencing data is only going to be exasperated now.
Michael Makinen: I will add to that Steve. This is Mike. One thing I point out is that when a retailer who operates in a mall with extremely high cost, extremely high extra cost looks across the street and basically says look I can be there for a third of the price at the same time generate similar sales. We're hearing that all the time from the mall tenants and we've got two portfolio reviews scheduled for the next two weeks with almost what I would call exclusively mall based tenants who are good credit, good operators and their main statement is look we want to be by TJ Maxx, Target, Marshalls, Ross at Burlington more than we want to be down the wing from a closing Dillard's and that basically is a -- what we see is an opportunity that we're really going to strike while the iron is hot.
Steve Sakwa: And do you think that that manifests itself in deals this year or just given the situation to just kind of get more pushed off into 2021 when you see the kind of fruits of that labor?
David Lukes: No, I think it'll definitely become some deals this year.
Steve Sakwa: Okay guys. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The last question today comes from Christopher Lucas of Capital One. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas: Hey good morning guys. Conor, just a couple of follow-up questions if I could. On the reserved you took in the first quarter there were any of them related to sort of the payment patterns you saw in April over they all first quarter specifically related?
Conor Fennerty: They were unrelated to any of the payment plans. I think from a collectability perspective I think it's all about one of our payment plans have been [deep] rent we defer as opposed to put it on a cash basis accounting.
Christopher Lucas: Okay and then you have any way to describe sort of the composition of the unpaid rent for April as it relates to sort of completely not paid versus partial payments?
Conor Fennerty: The majority is completely unpaid Chris. There's been a couple national change. I'm sure you've seen headlines have paid 20 or 50 whatever it might be but the vast majority has just been fully unpaid.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then Mike on leases that were set to commence say second quarter or third quarter what are you hearing from the tenants in terms of their interests in opening up and commencing rent?
Michael Makinen: There's some shop tenants that are a little more skeptical about it but most of the nationals are committed.
Conor Fennerty: And then remember just I would say from a timeline perspective Chris, we've always talked about third and the fourth quarter are the biggest openings. Clearly that could still be impacted by the pandemic but there typically is not a lot of tenants opening this time of year. It's really trying to get ahead of the holidays.
Christopher Lucas: Sure and then last question for me just guys -- in a lot of the conversation has been about the PPP program. I guess I'm just curious is whether you've done any analysis at this point of what tenants might be able to qualify for the Main Street lending program which really hasn't gotten off the ground yet?
David Lukes: Yes. We really don't have much visibility into that. Like I said our local tenant exposures is so low that we really don't have access to what they're looking for unless they ask for a rent assistance from us and then we can require them to prove that they've applied for other forms of financing but to-date honestly we just haven't seen enough data to be thoughtful about it.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time.
David Lukes: Thanks Chris.I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for dialing in and we'll talk next quarter.
Operator: Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
49,SITC,2,2020,2020-07-29 17:00:00,"Operator: Good day and welcome to the SITE Centers Second Quarter 2020 Operating Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. And I'd now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; Chief Operating Officer, Michael Makinen; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may material, differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties may be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and in the documents that we file with the SEC, including the most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call, including FFO, operating FFO and same-store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's press release. This release, our quarterly financial supplement and the accompanying slides may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.sitecenters.com. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Brandon. Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Once again, I'd like to thank my colleagues at SITE Centers for their tireless work over the course of the quarter. Our team has been dealing with a litany of unique situations with our tenants and our properties and they've certainly earned our admiration during this period of remote working. I'll start today with a brief summary of the events during the quarter, then give some thoughts on what we are seeing and hearing from our tenants, and conclude with some comments around the dividend and recent transactional activity. As I stated on our first quarter call, 100% of our properties have been open and operating in accordance with the ever-changing local and state guidelines. This is important as 84% of our centers are anchored by an essential retailer, and our responsibility as the landlord was to continue to provide access and the necessary operations. Unfortunately, many tenants were not able to be remained open. And as of April 4, our low point, only 45% of our tenants were open for business. Over the course of the quarter, we saw a gradual increase in tenant openings. And as of this past Friday, we are 92% open. For the most part, the remaining closed tenants are fitness and entertainment businesses, which have struggled to open with social distancing requirements. This significant reopening activity has allowed us an unusually high degree of communication with all of our tenants and 2 topics have emerged that are worth sharing with you today. First, payment of contract rent remains front and center in our conversations, and almost all tenants have acknowledged their obligation to pay under their lease contracts. Many, however, have asked for help in spreading those obligations over a period of time as they work to get business operations back on track and better match their cash flows. This has proven to be no small feat as it means both tenant and landlord need to review several thousand leases even in our focused portfolio of only 69 wholly-owned assets. We've been very happy with the agreements we've executed so far, where we are providing a deferral of some or all rent for a few months in return for true financial benefits to our company such as options exercised, lease terms extended or restrictive covenants loosened to our benefit. As of today, we've come to agreements on deferral programs that equals 17% of second quarter rent and 10% of July rent, whereas rent abatement or forgiveness agreements are negligible at only 40 basis points of second quarter rent. We have many ongoing discussions with tenants that are quite complex which helps explain the fact that our tenants are 92% open, but our July collections are at 71%. I would expect this gap to close as we execute more agreements but we will remain patient in our approach, and we'll provide more detail in the next few quarters. Some categories, such as fitness and theaters, are likely to remain challenged for some time. But these 2 groups represent only 7% of our ABR. The national profile of our tenant roster has proven to be a benefit, especially considering that 20 of our top 50 tenants have raised over $40 billion of debt and equity over the past 4 months, which has substantially improved liquidity positions from March and April. As you can imagine, the amount of dialogue with tenants during the quarter has been high. And if the topic, first, has been about rent during the pandemic, the second topic is the tenant's view of trends they see emerging from the pandemic. Since our properties are substantially all in high income suburban locations, our tenants are consistently mentioning the following 2 themes: first, work from home is increasing in this country. Whether it's 1 additional day per week or 1 per month, employees are spending more time in their communities, which is leading to more balanced traffic over the course of the week and increased visits per week. For our suburban-based properties, even the smallest change in shopping pattern can have an outsized and positive impact on sales and ultimately leasing prospects. Second, the value of convenience is increasing. Accessibility and ease of parking is crucial to tenants and customers alike. This is leading to additional opportunities on 2 fronts. First, as I mentioned last quarter, we started to see increased demand from traditionally mall-based retailers. This activity is accelerating with tenants attracted to our open-air footprint, lower occupancy cost and proximity to many of the same customers. Second, the demand for convenience is increasing our ability to adapt our real estate and profitably convert existing square footage into pads or shop runs unlocking accretive investment opportunities. Adaptations of valuable square footage will be an important part of our future, and we feel confident that we've selected the right real estate, but are also realistic that growth will not be linear given the increase in tenant bankruptcies. We're in the early stages of building this pipeline, and our expectation is that we'll have a chance to execute a number of value-enhancing tactical redevelopments in the coming years. In order to maintain maximum flexibility for these endeavors, the Board of Directors has agreed to suspend the third quarter dividend. We remain optimistic about our company's outlook and know that a strong balance sheet is crucial to capitalize on opportunities that will be available to us. We've worked tirelessly over the last 3 years to improve both our balance sheet and our liquidity and retain cash flow from the suspended dividend, along with our maturity profile, eliminates any near-term financing risk for the company. Before turning the call over to Mike, I wanted to address the agreements with Blackstone to unwind our 2 joint ventures, which were announced in connection with earnings. These agreements effectively swap the value of our preferred investment for equity and cash and replaces fee and interest income with higher multiple operating cash flow. We are excited about the transaction and the property-level opportunities. We will be able to provide much more detail about our business plans for the properties post closing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael Makinen: Thank you, David. In the second quarter, activity from national tenants picked up from pandemic Lowe's, though overall volume is still below pre pandemic levels as tenants prioritize their existing operations. We signed 4 anchor leases in the second quarter and 114,000 square feet of total space with spreads on new leases of 17% for the trailing 12-month period. Subsequent to quarter end, we signed Sprouts at Lake Brandon Village and have a number of other anchor leases near the finish line. Active sectors remain the discounters, grocery, beauty, quick service restaurants and banks. Local tenant activity has also picked up from March and April, though it remains much more submarket-specific with COVID outbreaks interrupting activity. In terms of quarterly results, the lease rate for the portfolio was down 50 basis points from the first quarter, largely due to the rejection of 2 24 Hour Fitness leases. In addition to 24 Hour Fitness, national bankruptcies this year where we have exposure include Pier 1, Gold's Gym, GNC, Tuesday Morning, Chuck E. Cheese and Ascena, which in aggregate, totaled 2.3% of base rent, including leases that have been affirmed. For leases rejected to date in bankruptcy, we expect backfill timing on average to be longer than the last few years, given the slowdown in leasing velocity. That said, our team is in active discussion with a variety of quick service restaurants and service users to backfill these locations, which have largely been shops. Moving to construction activity and tenant deliveries, 4 consolidated anchors started paying rent in the second quarter, including Total Wine at Wando Crossing, and we have another 9 consolidated anchors signed, but not yet open, with rent commencement dates expected in 2020 and 2021. Total base rent from tenants signed but not opened as of quarter end was $11 million. Construction activity on these spaces remains largely uninterrupted with no material impact to work from recent shutdowns. Lastly, led by our property management team, we continue to improve our efforts to assist our tenants with marketing, delivery and curbside pickup. A recent tenant survey we conducted indicated that over half of our tenants are interested in curbside service with 80% of our national restaurants, which is the majority of our restaurant exposure, currently utilizing or expected to roll out curbside service in the future. As David mentioned, our assets are located in affluent ZIP codes and provide excellent curbside visibility and access. We continue to work with our tenants on a one-off basis to make sure we're tailoring services to fit their needs. Conor?
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Mike. I'll comment first on quarterly earnings, discuss the Blackstone transaction and conclude with our balance sheet and liquidity. Second quarter results were primarily impacted by uncollected rent and reserves related to pandemic. We've adjusted our income statement presentation this quarter to help clearly identify the impact. In prior periods, revenue deemed at risk was reserved and labeled as bad debt. In our adjusted presentation, all billed revenue is included in base rent and recoveries with an offset or reduction for revenue deemed uncollectible, which includes bad debt and unpaid rent from cash basis tenants, among other items. This change does not impact NOI, same-store NOI or operating margins and is merely a change in presentation. Unpaid contractual revenue at site share for the quarter, including deferrals, totaled $44 million with $15 million of this amount deemed at risk or uncollectible, which was an $0.08 per share hit to OFFO. We also wrote off $3 million of pro rata straight-line rent, which was an additional $0.02 per share headwind. There were no other material onetime items that impacted second quarter OFFO. Subsequent to quarter end, $4 million of the $44 million of unpaid revenue was paid, reducing total unpaid revenue from the second quarter to $40 million at site share as of Friday. Moving forward, we are not providing an updated outlook at this time. However, there are a few items to consider for the third quarter and back half of the year. As I mentioned last quarter, as a result of pandemic, it is likely that disposition volume will be lower than our initial 2020 guidance, thereby reducing downward pressure on management fee revenue from 2019, which will help partially mitigate the impact from uncollectible revenue and reduced occupancy from bankruptcy-related closures. Interest expense is also expected to be lower in the third quarter due to a lower average line of credit balance. In terms of uncollectible revenue, cash basis tenants have paid 19% of quarter billed revenue. To date, these same tenants have paid 36% of their billed July revenue. If July trends remained constant for the entire third quarter, which is not our assumption, but simply a point of reference, third quarter net revenue would be approximately $2 million higher than the second quarter. Monthly cash basis collection trends are detailed on Page 11 of our earnings slides. On the agreements with Blackstone to terminate the 2 joint ventures, as David outlined, upon meeting certain closing conditions, SITE Centers will collectively acquire 100% ownership of 9 properties, including 2 properties that the company previously did not hold a material interest and receive based on the balances at quarter end, approximately $20 million of unrestricted and restricted cash. The properties to be acquired are secured by $197 million of debt with an average interest rate of 3.3%. In the second quarter, management fees from the 2 Blackstone joint ventures were just under $500,000, and interest income from our preferred investments was $3.5 million. We expect both closings to occur by the fourth quarter and will provide additional details once they occur. Turning to our balance sheet. The company remains well positioned with no debt maturing in 2020, no unsecured maturities until 2023 and minimal future development commitments. Additionally, we repaid $400 million of the $500 million from our first quarter line of credit draw in June and have $685 million of availability on our lines of credit and $128 million of consolidated cash on hand at quarter end. We have no material uses at this time, but expect to maintain excess cash on hand for the foreseeable future in light of the macro environment. In terms of our covenants, there were no material changes from the first quarter which is 2 of our 69 wholly owned properties encumbered today, providing future potential sources of additional capital and substantial capacity on each of our public bond and bank covenants. In our earnings slide deck, we again provided pro forma covenants to adjust for cash on hand as our real estate assets and unencumbered assets covenants do not net out cash in the calculations. Lastly, as David mentioned, the Board has suspended the third quarter dividend. Based on our estimate of tax net income today, we continue to believe that no further dividends are required to be paid in 2020 to satisfy our REIT requirements, which will result in almost $80 million of additional retained free cash flow in the second half of the year. There will likely be a need to declare a dividend in the fourth quarter, though that will be paid in 2021. That said, no decisions around future dividends have been made at this time. We continue to believe our financial strength will allow us to take advantage of future opportunities, some of which David outlined to create stakeholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question today will come from Christy McElroy with Citigroup.
Christine McElroy: Connor, I know you mentioned that there was an additional $4 million. It sounded like it was paid on Friday, so it didn't impact the numbers, the collection numbers that you have in there. So this number may be different. But with regard to the 19% that remains unresolved in July, that implies that tenants are reopened but still not paying rent. Can you just talk about how you guys are dealing with this unresolved bucket, which seems to be primarily national tenants, especially as we get closer to the August 1 rent payment, how are you thinking about lawsuits? And is that refusal to pay rent driving that 8% that are still not open?
David Lukes: Christy, I'll turn it over to Conor in a second, this is David. If you think about the last couple of months, I think a lot of this comes down to the philosophy of a deferral program. And you can tell that the amount of rent abatement we've done has been de minimis. It's been 40 basis points of second quarter rent. But the deferrals are certainly growing as time goes on, and I would expect that to continue. The majority of the uncollected rent is from tenants that we have ongoing dialogue, but we have yet to paper a resolution. You ask about what's our thinking or how do we think about the deferrals. There's a bargain to be had between the landlords and the tenants. And I think we've gotten past the point where the ask from the tenant side is abatement. And what we've gotten into is a realistic dialogue about how we can effectively lend them space for a period of time. And in return, they can loosen some restrictions or can agree to additional terms in their leases. And I think as the initial shock of the pandemic has started to subside a little bit, calmer heads have prevailed. And I think both sides are realizing that there's a pretty good deal to be had, and there are trade-offs that make sense. So I would say that we will start to close that gap between those that are opened and those that are paying. But I don't think the gap is going to be entirely closed in the month of July.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Christy, just to clarify, the $4 million I talked about. The reason I included that as a reference point was think about same-store in our balance sheet all as of June 30. Our payment data is as of last Friday. And so my point is simply, just in the month of July, we've collected another $4 million of the second quarter contractual rent. And then just to expand on David's last point, if you recall, for first quarter, we reported April collections on April 30 at 50%. Today, we're 67%, right? So a 17% increase over the last 3 months. I don't know if we'll see as dramatic of an increase over the next 3 months for July. But I do think it's an important point on David that it's an ongoing effort, and we're, the dialogues were active by the vast majority of our tenants who haven't paid. And some are just simply folding the towel and saying, ""Hey, you know what, I'll just go back to paying."" Others are saying they need deferral and others are holding out. So it's a really, it's fairly dynamic and given our concentrated tenant profile, one tenant can swing the percentages fairly dramatically.
Christine McElroy: Okay. Got you. And then just on the Blackstone unwind. Can you just talk a little bit about the genesis of that transaction? How did the 2 sides think about attributing value to the assets in this environment? And how, after closing, how does the transaction impact your pro rata leverage?
David Lukes: Sure. I can cover the first and the third part of that, but not too much on the middle. The genesis of the dialogue was simply the fact that this joint venture has been formed, I guess, it was almost 6 years ago. And it was significantly larger at the time, as you know. And as the portfolio gets smaller and smaller, it was simply not efficient for either party. So we made it a joint goal to split up the assets, and this is months ago. So I would say it was a pre-pandemic desire to resolve the joint venture in a way that was beneficial to both sides. Going forward, the difference for us is that it's a lot simpler to have a focused effort on 9 assets that we know well. And I think that the business plans that we have for those assets most likely are different if they're wholly owned than they would be in a joint venture. So we feel really great about the resolution. And I would hope that closing would occur sometimes toward the back end of the year.
Christine McElroy: And the leverage impact?
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Christy, for leverage, we'll move up about 0.25 of return, maybe modestly higher than that closing. The assets have a modestly higher growth rate than our current portfolio. So we think that there will be some natural deleveraging from those assets kind of at least occupied gap closing. And then to David's point, there are some other items from of our business plans, which will further impact leverage that we can discuss post closing. The only other thing I'd just add is it all secured debt, and obviously, it's not recourse that. So that's another point to consider.
Operator: And our next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.
Samir Khanal: So Conor, when I look at the leasing spreads, I mean, they've held up here, but I would think they were negotiated sort of pre-COVID here. Can you give us an idea how negotiations are going at this point, COVID language is being implemented and just kind of maybe deals that are assigned or kind of under negotiation sort of subsequent to quarter end here?
David Lukes: Sure, Samir, it's David. The anchor leases, as you point out, having 4 anchor leases signed during this quarter is pretty substantial and then one post quarter. But the reality is, and as you point out correctly, those negotiations were months ago. And so they're not necessarily a reflection of anticipated leasing spreads going forward. And to be perfectly honest, I don't think there's enough current activity to give a good kind of emotional idea as to where rents are going in the future. It's just not current enough data to let us know. I think that it's probably fair to say that in a portfolio that's now as small as ours, with only 69 properties out of more than 30,000 strips in the United States. We're not a great indicator of macro trends. Having said that, on the micro basis, we are seeing demand from all types of tenants at our properties. I think only the next 6 to 9 months is really going to shake out where rents are going and how desirable our land is and what people are willing to pay for it.
Samir Khanal: Got it. And I guess my second question is on the RCDs, or the rent commencement dates, for some of the tenants that were planning there sort of open later this year. I mean is it fair to assume that the bulk of those are being pushed out into next year at this point? And how should we be thinking about that?
David Lukes: It's reasonable to assume that because, especially, all of us working from home, I think we assume that everyone is working from a home, but the construction industry has been surprisingly resilient. Everything is a little slower, but I think I can give, I can let Mike give some more detail behind that.
Michael Makinen: Yes. I think, Samir, one of the most important things to point out is that while a lot of tenants were prevented from operating in the month of April, our construction progress was, for the most part, with the exception of the State of New Jersey and a few other local municipalities, pretty uninterrupted. And as a result, we've been able to deliver to tenants in a timely basis. And while some of the tenants are certainly looking at pushing some rent commencement dates, for the most part, we've maintained a relatively stable time line.
Samir Khanal: Okay. Even with sort of the flare-up you've seen or we've heard about in California, Arizona or even Florida. Do you think tenants are still, the bulk of those would kind of still be on track?
Michael Makinen: None of the flare-ups have affected our construction time line.
David Lukes: I think what he's saying, Samir, is that what has happened is we have not had much negative impact. What he did not say is that we don't expect there to be. I think if there's flare-ups in California and the southwest, in particular, over the last couple of weeks, I think it's very reasonable to expect that a tenant is going to call up and say, thank you for delivering on time, can I please delay my opening because it's just, it's a terrible time to open. And I think from our perspective, we're going to work very hard to make sure that the openings are strong. So I would expect that some of the RCD slip.
Michael Makinen: And then Samir, just on the $11 million number we disclosed, you think about the leases we're signing today, those are going to be 2021. So don't think about, I know you're not implying this, but don't think about all $11 million coming online by the back half of the year. Clearly, the leases we're signing today are for 2021.
Operator: And our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Thomas: First, just a follow-up on Christy's question, I think. David, you said deferrals were increasing as you move forward here, but that bucket decreased by 10% from June to July, so from 20% to 10% and the unpaid balance increased by a couple of percent. Can you just provide some detail on what's happening there with that unpaid percentage increasing and deferrals decreasing as we move forward? And then as we think about the deferral agreements that you've struck. If have you had to revisit any of those or maybe write-off any deferred rent since negotiations with tenants have begun?
David Lukes: Yes, Todd, I think your second part of the question, which I, if you don't mind, I'll respond to you first is really important because as we all know, when you shake hands with someone at a certain point in time, it's based on the conditions at that time, if there's a second wave or there's re-closings in certain parts of the country, there's no question that we are going to have to reopen conversations because a payment plan is based on time. And if the time's changed, I think the plans are going to change as well. So it's very hard to speculate right now. We have not had to revisit any of our deferral programs. And I'll add another point that of all of the deferral programs we've done with existing tenants with existing term, not one of them has had a reduction in base rent. So to date, I feel like it's been a very positive negotiation between a tenant that wants time and a landlord that wants control or term. and so it's been successful to date. To your point, if things change with the pandemic, then I think some of those deferrals might change as well. With respect to your first question, what I really meant when I was responding to Christy was simply that 3 or 4 months ago, I think one would assume that you're working with tenants until they open and once they open, everything is back to normal. And I think what I'm saying is that the complexity of negotiating deferral programs and leases and trying to kind of work through all of the terms that are important to both sides. It, there's a lag period. And so even though the tenants open, we're still working with them to kind of resolve and help with the extension of those programs. That's why I think that July is not going to be the end of deferral programs, we'll see them push a little bit into the fall as we work through the documents.
Conor Fennerty: And then, Todd, just we have some new disclosure on Page 9 of our slides on deferral repayments. 85% of our deferrals executed today, or agreed to today, are expected to be repaid in, I'm sorry, 89% in 2021 and beyond. So I think we're well aware of the, ask our tenants to defer 2 months or 3 months, whatever it might be, and then payback to utilize seems a little unrealistic. And so we're trying to craft that as part of our programs, knowing that this is not a snapback economy.
Todd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then actually, on, so on Page 9, Conor, maybe for you. If we look at the composition of the uncollected base rent in the quarter, how is that changed in July? Is that something that you're able to provide some color on?
Conor Fennerty: It's, I don't have that exact data, Todd. My guess is it's probably not that dissimilar because the same tenants we're discussing with the agreements or David mentioned nearing final terms on agreement are the same ones who are discussing July with us. And so if you think about it as part of the negotiation, the tenants are looking at this on a month-by-month basis. And so I think they want to see some resolution for their second quarter before they're willing to come in on July. So my guess is it's probably the same tenants that are kind of that bucket for all 4 months that we've seen to date.
Operator: And our next question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Richard Hill: I wanted to just get a little bit more clarity on the leasing spreads. It looks like new leases and renewals both increased prior to the last quarter. But I note that net effective rents came down. So I was wondering, Conor, if you could just help me walk through that.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. So Rich, if you look on Page 14 on our net effective rents, on the far right of the page, we give the percentage of GLA related to anchors, greater than 10,000 feet. As you look at our net effective rents, you're right, they're the lowest in the last year, but this is our highest percentage of anchor deals. And to kind of jive with Mike's comments that we're seeing anchors be active. We're seeing our international tenants to be active. The local tenants, which typically have small shops and have a higher net effect of rent, there's a lot more volatility there in terms of their activity. So where we've seen the biggest decline in activity over the last 4 months has been shops, which coincidentally have the highest net effect of rent. So that's what the biggest driver there is. And my guess is, Rich, you'll see that trend continue over the course of the year as long as there's flare ups.
Richard Hill: Got it. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up to that. On lease terms, are you seeing any differences in 2Q for the term of the lease that's being signed? Or has it been relatively consistent?
Michael Makinen: That's been relatively consistent. We really haven't seen any changes in the lease term.
Richard Hill: Got it. And then just one follow-up question for me. I think you addressed this, but just humor me for a little bit. Can you just walk through the difference between cash basis tenants paying 19% of 2Q '20 versus the 64% that was collected in 2Q?
Conor Fennerty: So cash basis tenants, Rich, if you look on Page 11 of our slides, it represent about 10% of our income. So if you think about it, I'm sorry, our base rent, I'm sorry, for the second quarter, and so if you look at the, you can back into what they represent as a percentage of unpaid rent and not surprisingly, it's a decent chunk. I can go into more detail with you off the call. I don't know if that answers your question.
Richard Hill: Yes. Maybe we just follow-up afterwards.
Operator: And our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarg with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: So 2 questions. First, just sort of going back to Christy and Todd's question. Conor, can you, just on the accrued but not collected rents, in the supplemental, I talked about $25 million that was accrued but not collected in the second quarter. But then you talked about the net $40 million that remains to be resolved. So can you, just so I'm clear, can you reconcile those 2? And then with the write-offs that you took in the second quarter, does that mean that this $25 million of accrued but not collected, you have a high degree of confidence that, that is in the, that the negotiations will work out such that, that is all collectible rent or should we think about further write-offs coming?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. It's a good question, Alex. I'll start with the last one. So on the, if we're accruing revenue and not collecting it, there is a high degree of probability required there to recognize that revenue. So our view today is that, that revenue that we're accruing, but not collecting is collectible. In terms of your question, how do we kind of bridge the gap between the $44 million of unpaid rent and the $25 million, the $25 million on Page 12 of our supplement is related to same-store NOI. The $44 million is related to the entire portfolio. If you look at Page 10 in our slide deck, it lays out for the consolidated portfolio, the JV portfolio had share and for the total company and how you can bridge from GAAP revenue, I should say, I'm sorry, build revenue to GAAP revenue on our income statement and so happy to spend more time. There's a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So happy to spend more time with you if you'd like.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. No, that's helpful, Conor. So basically, from an earnings perspective, we want to think about the larger number, not the smaller same store number.
Conor Fennerty: You're absolutely right.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, David, hopefully, your tenants have some info that will help answer this question. But clearly, curbside has been a huge success, rapid adoption. Have the tenants given any indication of how much curbside has been able to offset sales lost by traditionally customers going in, walking around the stores, picking up products and walking out. So just trying to get a sense for where tenant sales are now on a net basis, and how they think curbside has helped, if they can quantify how much they think curbside has helped offset traditional shopping patterns.
David Lukes: Yes. Alex, it's a great question. I wish that we had the secret algebra behind that success. I mean if you look at our tenant survey in the last month, where we reached out to thousands of tenants, I mean, the number that wanted curbside access was significant. Not surprising. I think everyone that has a family that's been shopping last couple of months is probably sort of curbside pickup themselves. So it has been very successful. The fact that SITE Centers are mostly parking lots and curb cuts make it pretty easy for a landlord to adapt the site plan to whatever the tenant wants, for the most part. We've seen anecdotal information and empirical information about tenant sales, which has been very positive on the ones that are using curbside. What we don't have is the relative impact of the curb side to the overall sales, unfortunately.
Michael Makinen: Alex, this is Mike. One other thing I could point out is that when you look at the grocery business in our centers, one of the things that we routinely do is evaluate the customer draw looking at cell phone app data. And what we've seen is that while several grocery operators have had increased sales, we've looked at the overall component of customers in the store versus in the parking field. And while the customer count in the stores may be down 30%, 40%, the sales could be up 25%, yet the amount of customers that we're seeing in the parking lots are actually increasing. So it's clearly a strong phenomenon, and we're all over it as far as working with our tenants to help them maximize that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust.
Ki Bin Kim: Can you just talk a little bit more about your philosophy when it comes down to the deferral agreement? Obviously, we're going to see varying numbers from different companies and what goes into making that thought, which could be very different. So I'm just curious about what, how did you approach it, what type of customers got it and things like that.
Michael Makinen: The one thing I will say is that as as you've seen, we really were very deliberately patient in dealing with deferral arrangements, waiting for, to see how things shook out because the initial stage of the pandemic, there was so much uncertainty. We weren't going to jump into deferral arrangements right away. So what we effectively did was to take a look at the tenant's performance as they reopened, and a lot of the deferral arrangements came from that stage of the game. The most important thing for us was that if we're going to effectively be lenders to these tenants for a few months of rent that we are going to have to have a win-win scenario. And as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, that's really what the philosophy came down to, I was looking at it from a bottom-up approach, space by space, lease by lease, looking at overall restrictive covenants that were in the leases, seeing where we could get those relaxed in exchange for a deferral. There were new options exercised and things like that. But the bottom line is there's no formula that is applicable to every tenant. Every single tenant had a very different discussion. Every single tenant had a completely different approach. And that's one of the reasons that we're at the end of July, and we're still working on a lot of these.
Ki Bin Kim: So I mean that's a good analogy, right? So is it correct to say or assume that the most creditworthy or, and credit in an asterisk meaning, I belief that they'll survive when come out of this. Are those the tenants that get deferrals? Or is there a decent-sized bucket of tenants that need that deferral, but are not, probably might not survive next year. Do those kind of deferrals as well? Or how did you approach that segment?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, if you had, it's David, if you had to put it in buckets, I would say there's 3. One are small shop businesses that need it and irrespective of their creditworthiness, it's in our best interest to keep them solvent in our portfolio, that happens to be a very small component of our rent roll, but it's there. The second group are those that it's more of a credit play than anything else, where they're a great customer of ours, a big tenant. There are some things that we need from them. And their creditworthiness is such that we feel very confident that the loan is money good. And I would say the third category has less to do with credit, more to do with control. I am willing to trade a couple of months of rent for certain loosening of restrictions on properties because the financial gain to us, whether they pay it back or not, is far superior. So it's not all credit, it's not all control, and there is some component of need. But it doesn't necessarily fit neatly. Some of them have 2 of those or 3 of those categories at once.
Ki Bin Kim: Right. And just last question. How should we think about same-store NOI going forward? Because you did include accrued but not paid rents, which is understandable. If I think about the pace of improvement for same-store NOI, does it really only stem from the unresolved bucket that become smaller?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, I think the reality is that we're not thinking about same-store NOI, it's just not that relevant for the foreseeable future.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. I mean, Ki Bin, there's a bunch of things. I mean we provided some breadcrumbs on NOI. We provided them for an earnings perspective, not for same-store. Obviously, cash basis tenants, to Rich's question, matters. The $11 million of signed on [indiscernible] open. ABR is, obviously, very material to our bottom line as well. We took a number of reserves this quarter related to uncollected rent. How that occurs or the pace of that over the course of the year is going to impact same-store. But to David's point, I mean, it's not, we've never operated our business for same-store NOI. We certainly budgeted and forecasted and provide guidance for it typically, but just not how we typically run our business. I would just tell you, from my seat, I think the relevance of the metric is kind of thrown out for the next 2-plus years because of cash basis tenants, because of accruals because of deferrals, it's really all over the place, to your point on just depending on how people structure deferrals, when those are repaid, et cetera.
Operator: And our next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: In terms of the unpaid contractual rent at $44 million, but then you got the $4 million that was paid recently, what merchandising category do those tenants fall in?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Linda, I don't know. It's all over the place. Again, just the $4 million does not, it's just a lot of people know, there's a difference between our payment data timing, i.e., as of last Friday, and the balance sheet and income statement from the second quarter. So over the course of the quarter, I'd expect that number to increase. Based off David's comments and Mike's comments about coming to agreements with more tenants, some of which we'll just see the tenant pay their full rent, but it's all over the place. I mean there's no one category that's jumping out, per se.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And then in terms of the comment about rejected leases from bankruptcies to date, taking longer to backfill than average, can you just put some parameters around that? How long would it take before versus your expectation now? And is that somewhat a function in the mixture of the boxes being backfilled or is that just the environment?
David Lukes: I think, Linda, it's really the environment. And if we had any information that we could share that would give you a little bit more insight, we would certainly do so. But the reality is, getting an idea as to how much leasing is going to be done over the next year or so, I think, is entirely dependent on how the reopening occurs across the country, and we just don't really have a very good window into that future.
Conor Fennerty: The only thing, the ironic part is, and Mike and David alluded to this, Linda, is that we're seeing more velocity on the anchors than the shops, right? So from a box perspective, you might actually see box backfills get done quicker or at a similar pace to where they were a year ago. That said, we haven't had many boxes get rejected today, to Mike's comments. All of our bankruptcy rejections have really been concentrated in the shops.
Linda Tsai: Just one final one. In your earlier comments about broader trends, you're talking about people working from home or discuss the importance of convenience, demand coming from the mall-based retailers. How do you think merchandising might change? Or what kind of tenants are you looking to attract?
David Lukes: That's a good question. Let me, Go ahead, Mike.
Michael Makinen: I think what we're going to see, first of all, I think we're going to continue to see a lot of convenience and service-based tenants which has been the trend, but I think that trend will continue. Financial institutions, quick service restaurants that are focused on drive-thru and carryout. I also think that from the standpoint of anchors, we're still going to continue to see the off-price and discount category being the strongest driver.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan.
Mike Mueller: You talked about very few abatements and the lease rate only went down about 50 basis points sequentially. So if we're looking at that $15 million of at-risk or uncollectible number in the quarter, I mean, how should we, I know that's looking at Q2 collections. But I mean, how should we think about that as a rearview metric versus something that's going to be recurring over the next few quarters or so? And is that a function of stuff that tends to be, you think, you're really not getting paid, you're not going to get paid on it. It's truly at risk or it's the documentation isn't there yet? So I mean, yes, so how should we think about that bucket going forward?
Conor Fennerty: It's a really good question, Mike. And it's really hard to answer without guidance. What I would just tell you is the biggest factor that's going to drive it is the payment rate, which sounds kind of silly. But if we just had a 71% payment rate over the course of the third quarter, I'm sorry, yes, the third quarter, which is what we have July to date, we'll have a lower uncollectable revenue line item versus the second quarter just because of the higher payment rate. So I mean there's a number of items that go in there. If you think about it, the 3 biggest numbers are, the 3 biggest drivers, say, excuse me, are cash basis tenants, reserves we make against individual tenants and then general industry reserves. And so our moods or feelings on certain tenants or certain industries is going to dictate that number as well as cash basis tenant payment rates. But I would just tell you, the easiest way to think about it is your view on collection rates is going to dictate the revenue deemed uncollectible, which I know is a bit of a nonanswer, but obviously, in the middle of the pandemic without guidance, it's challenging to provide visibility on that collection range.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay. And one other question. I think you had about $3.8 million of fee income tied not to RBI. So how much of that goes away with the Blackstone onlines?
Conor Fennerty: So Blackstone fees in the second quarter, Mike, were about $500,000. And then the interest income related to those joint ventures was about $3.5 million. So that's where you'll see the biggest impact. We do have a 5% stake in those joint ventures. And so there's a little bit of NOI running through our JV NOI but it's not material. The biggest impact you'll see is fees and interest income. And obviously, that will be replaced with NOI from the properties.
Operator: And our next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point.
Floris van Dijkum: And David, maybe can you try to quantify some of the benefits maybe of some of the extensions and restrictions on, or easement of restrictions in your lease discussions. Is it possible to do that at this point? Or how should we think about some of the value that's accruing to SITE Centers?
David Lukes: Floris, it's certainly possible. When we work on a deferral arrangement, we're effectively creating a net present value analysis for each negotiation so that we can evaluate it financially. I would hesitate to try and roll that all up and give guidance on that. But I think we're making decisions that are financially beneficial to the company. And I can, I guess, I'll leave it at that.
Floris van Dijkum: And, but is most of that benefit on an NAV basis or is it on a, just an earnings basis, i.e., you're extending your payments going forward? Or is it because you can now create additional space in your, at your center or something like that? How do you guys...
David Lukes: Most of it is on an NAV basis because most of the value is in restrictions that are eased to the point that we can then do other things with the property. In other words, there are certain situations where tenants can exercise an option or add term. But our assumptions in our August models for our assets, for the most part, have a pretty high retention rate, apps and bankruptcies, a high retention rate just because of the profitability of the tenants and knowing the submarkets that we're in. So I don't necessarily think that the extension of term is the number 1 goal. The number 1 goal is really gaining control back of the real estate and most of that control comes in the lease restrictions that a tenant has.
Floris van Dijkum: One other question maybe. What segment of, what tenant category had the greatest amount of deferrals? Is it apparel? Is it gyms? Or have you written off most of your gym income? Or how should we think about the various segments in your portfolio?
David Lukes: I think given the relative size of our tenants, we haven't commented on the percentage of deferrals out of each category. I mean I think you can assume that there's a group of them that have need and those certainly would include entertainment and fitness. Then there are those categories that, I think, are pretty public in the fact that they have a lot of control over the real estate, that would be a lot of discounters and grocer categories. And so depending on the tenant, we have exercised some thoughtfulness around the deferral programs, but we really haven't quantified it for you in terms of the tenant category.
Floris van Dijkum: Okay. One, maybe one last question for me. In terms of reinstating guidance, your earnings were actually, even though you have given no guidance, we're pretty much in line with expectations. Do you expect to, do you think, at the end of the fourth quarter, will you be reinstating guidance? Or do, you're still, you can't say at this point when you will do that?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Floris, I would just say, I think you appreciate this company's commitment to transparency and visibility, and we think guidance is part of that. That commitment is unwavering despite the pandemic, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I fully expect us to provide guidance at some point. A question of when is just unclear at this time.
Operator: And our next question will come from Christy McElroy with Citigroup.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. I hope to come back on the Blackstone transaction, just a couple of quick clarifying questions. I guess what were you solving for in the exchange? The preferred had been written down to about $90 million from a face value of $200 million. And I can remember many years ago, it was almost $400 million as sales proceeds have paid that down. But as you were thinking of solving for that $89 million, the $20 million of cash, which means, I guess, you value the equity above and beyond the $200 million of mortgage debt at about $70 million. Or is there a different way to think of what you're trying to fall for?
David Lukes: Well, Michael, I'm going to try and thread the needle with what I can say pre closing. But for the most part, what we're trying to solve for is a simplification of our business. We're trying to solve for protection for our shareholders who had a preferred that had a value on it, and we were trying to solve for our opinion of the real estate, which was encumbered in multiple different pools of loans, which is, I think, public knowledge. And we were simply trying to find value on these business plans for each one of these properties and make a trade of our pref that was effectively secured by all the assets and concentrate now in the form of cash and a smaller group of assets.
Michael Bilerman: On the debt, what is the debt yield effectively on the $200 million of outstanding mortgage debt for those assets?
Conor Fennerty: Michael, we haven't provided that. There's a property table, which you can piece together, probably a pretty good guess on that, but we can't disclose that at this time.
Michael Bilerman: Yes. So I get about $12 million, sorry, $18 million of NOI. And so from a debt yield perspective, it looks like it's running about 9%. I don't know if that's in the ballpark of what you're thinking because I don't know if there are some operating expenses that these assets that have been paid, but circa, let's call it, $18 million of NOI, over $200 million was 9%. Is that a fair assumption?
David Lukes: Michael, we just can't comment on it. I'm sorry.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. How do you think about the lost income, right? And I assume you talked about the preferred income that you're generating on $200 million, right? So even though you've written down the value of the preferred to $90 million, you were still earning at least the cash interest. I know you know we're no longer earning the pick. But you still have the cash interest, which is providing that $13 million of preferred income on top of probably $2 million of fees. So as you think about cash flows, is this a net negative, net neutral or net positive relative to generating the current cash flow that you have coming off of the preferred?
Conor Fennerty: That one we can answer. So we think the transaction is FFO neutral in year 1, Michael, which will help, I think, bridge the gap on your NOI question. From a cash flow perspective, it's going to be dependent on our business plan, the CapEx we spend at the properties, obviously, as you know. And that's where, to David's point, post closing, we'll provide some detail on our business plans for the properties. Q - Michael Bilerman And just last question, just on, in terms of the FFO. What would it be? I don't know if you're including marketing the debt to market because the debt, I would, I guess, would be a bit above market or any leases in that calculation. So what would it be like on an AFFO basis?
Conor Fennerty: It's immaterial from a noncash perspective, there's no benefit from that.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vince Tibone with Green Street Advisors.
Vince Tibone: I have one additional follow-up on the Blackstone deal. I just want to better understand how you thought about this transaction given your current cost of capital. I mean you're positioning it as a swap, but isn't this more akin to about $250 million, $270 million acquisition that is financed with existing mortgage debt and the book value of the preferred equity. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why growing the balance sheet and acquiring is the right move now, given where your stock is trading today and your current cost of capital.
David Lukes: I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion that it's an asset purchase. I mean we were already on an equity position on these properties.
Vince Tibone: But it's really the, because you're acquiring, you basically had no share of the debt, and you're going to be taking on an additional roughly $200 million of debt on your balance sheet. And then you're getting swapping the preferred for the interest in the properties. And you are growing both the assets and liability side of the balance sheet. So ultimately, that's why, how I came to the conclusion that you are really a net acquirer here. I mean leverage is going to go up. So I mean, that's why I came to that conclusion.
David Lukes: I think the way that we have always looked at the preferred is that it's subordinate to the mortgage debt. And in many, and in certain instances, it's subordinate to the common, but it is equity. And therefore, it is absolutely a swap from a piece of paper. It's secured by numerous properties, and it's simply concentrating it on a smaller bucket.
Vince Tibone: Okay. That's fair. And then just is there any color you can provide on how the, excuse me, how the valuation was negotiated relative to pre-COVID levels, any color just on between the you and Blackstone, how you thought about what's the right mark for the 2 pools of assets and any differences in cap rates from February to now?
David Lukes: I think it was 2 parties at arm's length that had, both of them had a lot of history on the properties for greater than 5 years. And it was simply both parties coming to an agreement as to what each party thought was fair.
Vince Tibone: Okay. Fair enough. And then just lastly, are you able to provide the decline in second quarter same-property NOI on a true cash basis?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Vince, we give you those pieces on the same-store page, if you look at footnote, give me one second, sorry. Footnote 2, I think it's an earlier question from someone. It includes $25 million of accrued revenue on Page 12. And so if you exclude that from the total revenue, you'll get a cash basis same-store NOI. I think to our earlier comments, though, you're going to see incredible volatility in same-store NOI, just from, this third quarter will ""overearn"" by $4 million, as I mentioned to an earlier question, that was second quarter rent paid in the third quarter. So I would just tell you, you're going to see extreme volatility in same-store for probably the next 2 years as we work through deferrals.
Operator: And our next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: I wanted to get your view on a recent call, the CEO of a large private shopping center portfolio said they could see that total portfolio NOI could trough 15% lower than pre-COVID before recovering and that the recovery could take several years. How do you feel about that? Is that 2 barrels?
David Lukes: How do I feel about his statement?
Haendel St. Juste: Not at all. The statement as it relates to the industry.
David Lukes: I guess I don't have an opinion. I have an opinion about our own assets, but it's a pretty small component over the overall industry.
Haendel St. Juste: So it's your portfolio over the next 2 to 3 years, actually, 2 questions. How long do you think it takes for us to get back to a period of stabilization, is it 2022 possible? And as we think about the cash flows for your portfolio, there's 85% 2 barrels in perspective to think of what that cash flow looks like compared to pre-COVID?
David Lukes: Well, I have to tell you, I wake up and think of that exact question most days. I think you can also appreciate the fact that the rolling pandemic through various communities and the lack of clarity as to when this will end, how to lend, how long tenants can last, which ones are going to be profitable, which ones aren't, is extremely unclear. And so I think my desire to guide to what I think a trough could be and when, I think, would be unwise.
Operator: And our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One.
ChrisLucas: I guess just going back to the Blackstone JV, just in terms of how the assets were selected. Were you able to identify each of those assets as, in total and sort of cherry-pick them out? Or was there sort of an alternating sequence in terms of them picking an asset, you picking an asset kind of approach?
David Lukes: Chris, I think there was enough flexibility for us both to have a very positive and meaningful negotiation and for both parties to feel like they got what was important to them. So yes, I think there was plenty of flexibility. I mean as you noticed, we didn't have an equity position in a couple of the assets. And so I guess that's about as much of an answer as I can give. I do feel like we have enough flexibility.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then just as it relates to either the rent obligations or deferral agreement obligations that were satisfied during the quarter. Were security deposits or a letter of credit used for, to satisfy either?
David Lukes: No.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then as it relates to the deferral payback period, is there a weighted average sort of payback period we can look towards sometime in, obviously, '21, but is it middle of the year, back end of the year, how should we be thinking about that?
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Chris, rather than a weighted average, we provided it by a year. So on Page 9, the purple kind of ring chart in the bottom right corner, we give the deferrals by year. And as we get more color on the unresolved balances for the second quarter in July, obviously, that chart could change. But to my, I think it was Todd's question from earlier. We, as of today, the lion's share of that repayment is really spread over the 2021.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then last question for me, a quick one. Just on the bankruptcy process right now. Is it kind of gotten back into normal process? Or is there still some delays that we saw sort of in the first quarter and into the second quarter? Just [indiscernible]
Conor Fennerty: The, yes, it's a good question. The delays have, I would say, moderated, per se, than what you saw from Pier 1 and Modell's initially. The process, I think, is probably prolonged though, versus pre-COVID just because of, obviously, the lack of in-person meetings and probably a longer liquidation process. But I would say the kind of absolute pauses you saw from March appear to have been removed from the process.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you, all, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."
50,SITC,4,2020,2021-02-18 14:55:04,"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the SITE Centers' Fourth Quarter and Year End 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, you will hear from Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Security laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties may be found in our earnings press release issued today and in the documents that we filed with the SEC including our most recent reports on 10-K and 10-Q.
David Lukes: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. We had a strong finish to the year with record-leasing activity and continued improvement on the collection front. These results are a product of the work of everyone at SITE Centers and I want to thank all of my colleagues for their continued dedication . 2020 was a challenging year on many fronts, and because of our tireless efforts, the company is in a fantastic position for the future. I'll start this morning with a summary of fourth quarter events and then discuss some emerging macro tailwinds, which are providing support and growth to our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. Consistent with the last quarter, 100% of our properties and 98% of our tenants remain open and operating as we continue to provide the necessary support for our communities. Collections continued to move higher; and as of Friday, we've collected 94% of fourth quarter and 94% of January rents. Unresolved monthly rent is now running around 3% with remaining tenants in various forms of settlement negotiations. We continue to take a methodical approach to resolving any unpaid rent, which along with the deferral repayments is driving continued progress on prior period collections. We've now collected 88% of rent from the April 2020 through January 2021 period. And after including deferrals for accrual tenants, we are expecting to collect 94% of base rent. To put that in context, at the time of our first quarter 2020 earnings call on April 30, only 49% of our tenants were open, and we had collected just 50% of April rent. We've come a long way since then and it's worth stepping back and recognizing two important outcomes that developed throughout 2020. First, around 90% of our tenants are national with a deep understanding of their contractual obligations and proven access to capital. Notwithstanding those contracts, many national tenants reacted to the early COVID fears by withholding rents, while we continued to pay operating expenses and property taxes to our local communities. Over the next few months, most of these tenants realized that protecting the rights to occupy their space within our properties was extremely important, and they began to repay the rent that was owed.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, David. I'll comment first on fourth quarter earnings and operating metrics, discuss 2021 guidance, and conclude with our balance sheet and dividend. Fourth quarter results were primarily impacted by uncollectable revenue related to pandemic. Total uncollectible revenue at site share was $4.5 million or $0.02 per share hit to OFFO. Included in this amount is $2.2 million of payments and net reserve reversals related to prior periods. Other than the write-off of $1.6 million of pro rata straight line rents, which is additional $0.01 per share headwind, the only other material one-time items that impacted fourth quarter OFFO was $1.2 million of lease termination fees, which is higher than our normal run rate. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was down 30 basis points sequentially, largely due to Steinmart store closures. Based on minimal bankruptcy activity we are tracking today and the recent pipeline that David outlined, we expect the lease rate to stabilize at this level. Trailing 12-month lease and spreads decelerated in the fourth quarter with renewals impacted by one anchor deal executed to maintain occupancy. New lease spreads were impacted in part by deals to backfill space formerly occupied by Pure1 , which generally pay above market rents. Based on our pipeline today, we expect blended leasing spreads in 2021 to be consistent with the first three quarters of 2020, though renewable spreads may remain under pressure in the first quarter due to short-term COVID-related deals. Moving forward, we are introducing 2021 OFFO guidance of $0.90 to $1 per share. The volume  end of the range assumes no improvement in collections with continued occupancy headwinds and the top half of the range assumes a steady improvement collections and are returned to a more normalized pre-COVID operating backdrop. Additional 2021 guidance pieces include JV fees of $11 million to $15 million and RVI fees which excluded disposition and refinancing fees of $13 million to $17 million. Other 2021 factors to consider include G&A, which we expect to be around $54 million, interest income, which we expect to be immaterial in 2021, with the closing of the Bison  transaction in the fourth quarter, and the repayment of our preferred investment and interest expense, which we expect to be around $23 million in the first quarter at our share and relatively consistent over the course of the year.
David Lukes: Thank you, Connor. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please, go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, good morning. David, you talked about some investable themes materializing as a result of population shifts and work-from-home trends. What does that mean for SITE's investment efforts here? The company was starting to invest ahead of the pandemic, I think the acquisition of the Blocks in Portland was one of the more recent acquisitions and commentary was shifting toward becoming more offensive. How are you thinking about investments today, and how should we think about the timeline to act on some of these themes?
David Lukes: Good morning, Todd. How are you? I think right now, our investment as you can see from the leasing pipeline is primarily in leasing CapEx. We just got a ton of activity, and our capital allocation right now is squarely in the leasing front. Having said that, it's just very interesting to note that even before the pandemic, we were making investments in properties that I would say were heavily tilted towards convenience, a little bit more format agnostic, in other words less focused on a specific type of anchor or a format and more focused on where the tenants want to be. The Blocks portfolio is a bit more urban. It is also heavily convenience oriented. If you look at a tenant roster, it just got a lot of service tenants and banks and so forth. And there were other investments we made -- one in Austin and one in Tampa that were also heavily based on convenience, kind of a local two- to three-mile community. And those properties performed better than most over the course of the pandemic. So, I think for me it's just reinforcing the fact that the customer traffic tends to be heavily focused towards convenience. All of these trends that are coming out of COVID are making me a lot more bullish on the convenience aspect in wealthier suburbs. And so, as we start to make property acquisitions, which I do expect to happen this year, we're going to continue that focus on where the tenants want to be, because frankly that's where the rent growth is. And the rent growth is in convenience-oriented property. So, I think we're going to be buying into a rent growth theme as opposed to buying into a vacancy theme. And those are different, right. When you get into an early part of a recession, a lot of investors have a choice to make. They're either going to go for distressed assets that have some vacancy, and you can provide some near-term growth. For this particular recession that we're seeing, it's a bit of a split. You can’t make an investment theme based on occupancy. But boy, I'll tell you that the leasing volume and the number of calls that we're getting from tenants makes me feel like the rent growth theme is a much more powerful long-term investment strategy.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then Conor, in terms of investments, are there any investments embedded in the guidance at all at either the high or low end of the range?
Conor Fennerty: No, that's not, Todd.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then David, you also talked about retailers launching new concepts, and it sounds like the leasing pipeline is pretty healthy here. How much of that pipeline is comprised of new concepts today, and how meaningful of an opportunity might that be? Maybe you can just shed some light on what you're seeing there in terms of where the demand is in terms of the space sizes and maybe give some examples of some of those expansion or new concepts?
David Lukes: Sure, Todd. At this point, if you look at the supplemental and you look on Page 14, which kind of shows the total new leasing and comp leasing, the fourth quarter was pretty dramatic. I would say that the percentage of those total deals is still the same kind of strong suspects that have been heavily in leasing for the last couple of years. So, I don't think the newness of concepts is contributing heavily today, but it is providing competition and a number of the new concepts have us under NDA, so I can't really be open about new concepts we're seeing because a lot of retailers are looking at creating another banner or another flag within their empire. And I do think over the next couple of years, we are going to see some new concepts roll out. But what surprised me most, Todd, is that the two categories that were most difficult to fill in the last five years have been box spaces -- number one, which I would say is the 20,000 to 50,000 square feet category; and then secondly is when we lost Pure1 , that's kind of 8,000 to 10,000, square feet space was the most difficult. The new concepts that are emerging now seem to be half from the 8,000 to 10.000 and half in the kind of 25,000 to 50,000 range, and that was surprising. It's surprising to see new concepts that are focused on larger suites, and I do think that that is driving some of our square footage gains in the fourth quarter, and I do think that's going to continue for the next year or two.
Todd Thomas: Okay, great. All right. Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: The next question is from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. First of all, let me thank you for the earnings presentation. I thought it was very good, particularly Page 14. I wanted to talk through just a little bit about the guidance in 2021 and maybe push you a little bit. Because if we're thinking about 94% of rent collected and presumably you're going to get a healthy percentage -- my words, not yours -- of deferrals back in 2021, why isn't it in a realistic scenario where total NOI -- consolidated NOI could be closer to 2019 levels versus still what looks to be relatively still behind versus -- given what's implied by the guide? Walk me through that. Why shouldn't we be more bullish?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. It depends on -- excuse me, Rich -- on the classifications, the deferrals, right. These deferrals, there's no necessarily NOI impact, right. You're not going to see it in earnings. If they're cash basis, you're right. It could be a decent tailwind. What I would just say, if you think back to my prepared remarks, and we're at $0.25 and let's just use OFFO as a proxy for NOI, including the quarter were $2.2 million of reserved reversals from prior periods, right. We also have the least termination fees of $1.02 million . And then RVI fees will step down by $1 million. So, those three pieces are about $4.5 million or $0.02 a share. So, so start at $0.23, then annualize from there. But to your point, I'm not going to say we support that logic, but I think from a cash flow perspective, even on an NOI perspective, you could see some pretty big deals  this year as the deferrals come through and you're seeing acceleration in collection. I would just say it's really early, Rich. We're encouraged by activity, we're encouraged by collections. David mentioned number of times our national exposure and how important that is to us -- 41 of our top 50 are public companies. That helps with our visibility. But just given where we are in the pandemic, we don't have perfect visibility. So, I think you're going to hesitate to see us really commit to anything until we get a little more clarity on the course of the year.
Rich Hill: Yes. That's completely fair and I appreciate it. I would expect nothing less. I wanted to come back a little bit to the leasing volume and Q4, it was really nice to see leasing volumes accelerate. One of the things that we've always thought is attractive about SITE Centers, is you've intentionally selected properties with below-market leases for a number of different reasons, which provides an interesting growth story over the medium term. So, if that narrative is still true, why did the leasing spreads -- at least on a quarterly basis, not trailing 12-month basis, but on a quarterly basis -- why did they turn negative? And I'm not saying it's a bad thing because obviously, there's two components: there's occupancies and there's leasing spreads. But can you maybe walk through if there's anything specific that happened in the quarter that maybe would have led to a temporary decline in leasing spreads that we shouldn't project going forward?
David Lukes: Sure. Let me back up one second, just in terms of asset selection. If you have a chance as an investor to build a portfolio one at a time, you can do so on investable themes that you think are going to work long-term. When we did the RVI spin-off, it was a chance to almost do that. You're not building it property by property, but you're selecting the keepers from the sellers. And in doing so, you have to make a decision as to how you're selecting those properties. It is true that we had a number of properties and do that have below-market rents. And Steinmart going away as an example of where we're going to capture a lot of those below-market rents. But really, if you look at the statistics of what was selected for SITE Centers to keep and be an ongoing growing entity, it was number one household income. There's just no question that's the biggest difference between RVI and SITE Centers is household income. It's not necessarily tenant roster, it's not grocery anchored versus power, it wasn't necessarily mark to market on in place rents, it really had everything to do with household income. Because historically, that's where I've seen the most stability and bad times and the most rent growth and good times. I do think that it was a reasonably good idea and I think that the pandemic is kind of doubling down in that thesis  simply because of the interest by retailers in those markets. I would agree with you, Rich, that over the long-term, rent spreads are important because they tell a story about rent growth. The problem is with a company of our size, it's a pretty bumpy path and we have some quarters that have had really strong spreads and then we had this last quarter which was negative. In this quarter in particular, it had almost everything to do with releasing Pure1 boxes. And if you remember from what I've mentioned a minute ago, the lease up of 8,000 to 10,000 square foot boxes has been pretty weak for a couple years. It's starting to get strong and there's a couple of new concepts, particularly medical uses and other types of convenience stores. They really want that square footage and so, we're happy to add those to our properties. But the leasing spreads were impacted negatively by kind of those recent Pure1 spaces getting eaten up. That could continue if we continue to lease spaces that had a higher rent if the inventory is more Pure1, or it could reverse substantially if we start leasing up the Steinmart locations or other ones like that if they have lower rents. So, it's going to be bumpy, but I will say if you look on Page 14 of the sup and you kind of see the rent spreads over the trailing 12 months around 8%, a couple years ago at investor day, I believe we showed that we felt that portfolio can deliver 5% to 10% positive rent spreads in the long-term. And so, I'm still supportive of that original thesis. We're going to be in the long-term in that 5% to 10% range, but it's not that we want to end up with a quarter to here and there that are negative.
Conor Fennerty: Just to echo David's point. The vintage for the bankruptcy is incredibly impactful given our denominator. So, Steinmart comprising 300% to 500% mark-to-market; the pipeline that David mentioned has kind of led to spread that in kind of low 20s but we signed those in once in a pool etcetera  could have a material impact on what we report.
Rich Hill: That's really helpful, guys. And one more quick question for me. Transaction activity. And the market feels a lot better than it did, gosh, six or eight months ago. But we haven't seen a tremendous amount of transaction activity -- we've seen some but not a lot. We haven't seen maybe as much as some would have hoped in RVI. Are we in a weird time period where there's a bid-ask spread that is limiting that transaction volume? Said another way, there's no distress coming out, but there's still enough uncertainty in the world where people don't want to come in with both feet in? How are we supposed to think about the transaction market?
David Lukes: Yes. It's really interesting because you would think that the bid-ask spread is the reason why the industry hasn't seen a lot of transactions. There's been a couple in RVI, but it hasn't been dramatic. We've sold a few properties here and there. I think it's less the bid-ask spread as much as the equity out there seems to be following the credit markets. And I just think that was less available last year. That seems to be changing pretty -- in the last month, I think we've started to see a lot more positive momentum on the credit side. So, my feeling is with the strong performance in the open-air sector from most portfolios, I do think that credit markets are going to be more constructive on lending to open-air. And you better believe that there's equity waiting to be invested. But I think that equity has to follow the credit market. It feels like this year is going to start to ramp up.
Rich Hill: Thank you guys. That's it for me.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Bilerman of Citi. Please, go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Good morning. David, you talked a lot about sort of the anchor renewals and you threw up some numbers on the call about the pipeline 2022  deals in negotiation, following 2018 , it did in 2020. I wasn't sure if that was just the wholly-owned 78 assets or whether that was a whole portfolio. So, if you can just clarify sort of what basis it's on? And then talk a little bit about how much of that activity represents the rollover that you have, I think over 10,000 square feet? There's about 8,000 at least in the wholly-owned portfolio and a few more in the unconsolidated that don't have options. So, I don't know how much of it is -- those tenants that are rolling, how much is existing vacant space?
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Michael. It's Conor. So, it's the comparable portfolios. The JVs and wholly-owned. And that's why I gave some color on the kind of NOI impact. What it means for SITE Centers is call it an additional 2% boost to our sign on  open pipeline. If you look at that pipeline today at the $13 million sign not open, plus the 22 anchors, all but maybe one or two anchors are effectively vacant today. So that's all --if you're taking fourth quarter 2020 NOI as a starting point, that's all NOI to come. The other point I would just add to that is remember, we're talking just base rent. Right? The recoveries on these anchors or these deals are pretty impactful. And then the last point I'd make is the pipeline, David mentioned is just anchors. We've got a number of pads, groundings, et cetera in the hunt  for as well, which David mentioned, the rent growth we're seeing for convenience-oriented real estate, some of those rents are bigger and larger than some of the anchors were citing. So, I would just say again, just to answer your original question, it's a mixture of wholly-owned and JVs. So remember, we're also qualifying it by just giving you base rent.
Michael Bilerman: Right. And then at what point do you sort of feel the small shop occupancy will start to revert and start to move up with all this demand and the data that you're seeing on the traffic levels? I would have thought you would have seen more -- maybe some small business openings to take advantage of those stores, which don't require as much capital investment relative to an anchor. And so, you're sitting there at 83%. At what point does that start to march the other way consistent with the anchor deals you're doing?
David Lukes: It's a really good question. I wish that I had a crystal ball, Michael. Normally, I would say that we're getting a lot of shop activity -- maybe a lot too aggressive. We're getting reasonably strong shop activity, but the backdoor is still open. Meaning it's more difficult for shop tenants during the recession than it has been at anchors. I'll echo again what Connor said, you look at our top 50 tenants, they represent 60% of our base rent and of those top 50, 41 of them are public companies. And that same group raised over $50 billion of fresh capital in 2020. So I think the kind of immediate leasing momentum is coming from the anchors. If they start opening and generating sales and the vaccine gets out, I do think the shops will follow that. But today, I wouldn't say that the shops are as aggressive as the anchors are. I do agree with you, if you're saying that the shops should follow what we need to see happen, and we need to see the shops not going out the back door, numbers not closing or staying close. And on that front, I do think we have a pretty small exposure, since most of our shops, you look at our restaurant list they tend to be national tenants. But they're being a little more careful than the anchors are right now. 
Michael Bilerman: And just one last quick one, just on Canadian. The land sale up in Toronto for 22 million was your basis cost $3 million, or had been written down and looking at the stuff that looked like it was a 10% ownership and you sold it for $88 million. So I wasn't sure if there was a promoted interest that got you to '22 just go through the math there. 
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Michael it was $83 million, it's on page 18, transaction vary at the bottom of the page there. I don't recall if that was a net basis, we took out a write down previously; I think it's a land -- a piece of land we wanted for some time, so I'd have to come back on the promoter of the structure on that front.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. So, few questions here. First just David going into RBI, I understand from the U.S. perspective that open air coming back, and that should juggle similar sales there. But how would you rate things on the island, as far as the same trends and preferences for open air are also on Puerto Rico? And also the credit is the same or is it a different dynamic there that still lingering from pre pandemic when sales on the island were a lot slower than they were in the May month?
David Lukes: Hey, Alex good morning. It is a very reasonable question. I do think it's important because, you know, as you all know, we will be very happy to receive back our $190 million preps that is at RBI, and that ended on asset sale. So I do think that even though it's a separate company is relevant for sure. My personal feeling like you're saying is that the durability of open air in the US, even in secondary markets, if there's a dominant property, they performed pretty well during the pandemic. And I would say that's true of the RVI assets and aggregate, the US performance was pretty good. The tenant rosters look somewhat similar to site centers. And so if the credit markets continue what they've been doing in the past month and getting more constructed on lending my hope and my expectation is we start to see more us RBI transactions this year.  For Puerto Rico, it's really hard to tell. I mean, as you know, we closed on one asset sale on Christmas Eve. We have had a number of conversations recently with people that are kicking tires in Puerto Rico and trying to understand the dynamics there. I personally think that the equity is a little bit ahead of the debt in Puerto Rico. And the reason is that there are some interesting macro issues. Puerto Rico has much less square footage per capita than the US. Puerto Rico has much less online sales penetration. And if you look at that traffic going to the properties, the sales of grocery stores and Wal-Mart itself work is really strong on the island. And I think there's a lot of interest politically as to you know, how the country is doing, what their own credit profile and economic future looks like? A lot of people are interested, but I will say that I don't have any visibility as to when transactions will pick up in Puerto Rico. I wish I did, but I just don't. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, well, maybe just to that point, the rent mark to market if leasing trends here in the US you expect to be, sort of modestly positive rent spreads. Is that the same there? Or are you guys still looking at heavy rent roll downs, which is perhaps more of the issue from a lender perspective on the islands. 
David Lukes : The Puerto Rican portfolio, it just like we said in the US, when we see rent spreads and everything to do with a vintage of bankruptcy. In Puerto Rico, you're right it has everything to do with the vintage of the leases being signed. And it just so happens when a lot of big box and kind of national chains move into Puerto Rico. They're now past their primary term, they're in their options. And so when it gets to the end of their term, a number of them have been above market. And so I would say we're still dealing with some roll down. I think the last two years or so we've probably dealt with a bulk of them. So there's a little bit of rolling down left. But I don't think that the spreads are as strong as they are in the US on a trailing 12 month. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then just looking here, David, one is looking at Slide 12 of the PowerPoint, here, you guys are still have the anchor, and small shop is pretty small as a percent ABR. So when we think about rent spreads, and your ability to drive rents, which is clearly something you've well-articulated. My impression is that the big anchors, the rent bumps are pretty modest, pretty tepid, and that's the real juice comes from the smaller tenants. But for you guys, the smaller tenants are a small part of the portfolio. So is it really that small part, the small shops really are driving the outsize or is there more juice as these anchors roll that we may not typically be thinking about?
David Lukes : I'm trying to unpack that question. I mean, if you look at the near term growth of this company, a lot of this occupancy related. The number of anchors being signed on existing vacant spaces is so large, that we're going to see a lot of good solid growth from brand new 10 year leases with credit tenant filling space. And like Connor said, it's not just the ABR, it's also the leverage on the triple net, which the landlord is paying at that point. Once that stabilizes, I mean, the fact of the matter is, any portfolio that's heavily weighted towards National Credit, but there's an anchors of shops. The National Credit tenants, they get something for being a credit worthy tenant and in general, its rent bumps every five years, not rent bumps every year. So this product type is, open your product tax is geared towards national tenants, once you fill up the space and get to kind of a high stabilized occupancy. The growth is not that high, because the tenant rents bumps tend to be 10% every five years. And so you kind of have a cap on your growth. I think that's what you're asking.  Now, where that would change is something we haven't seen in a while, which is rent growth in anchors. And that's an interesting subject. I mean, I don't think you generally see rent growth until you have a lack of supply. And you can tell by our leasing volume, we still have supply. But it sure feels like that supply is winnowing down pretty fast. And my hope is, once we get through this kind of big wave of box leasing, the opportunities that we have left, let's say an Office Depot leaves or runs out of term. And we want to replace that my hope is, with the small inventories left, we are going to be able to push anchor rents, and that hasn't happened in a while.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. So that's really the point where you're talking about the rent growth, which is some of that is just coming from getting back underwater space, you know, pure one aside. And the other part is just as you rapidly lease up the anchors, that the scarcity then allows you to get leverage there. So it sounds like that's the two step part of it, which is good?
David Lukes : Yes, exactly. Right. I feel like in the near term, this is all about occupancy and mark to market on whoever leaves. Step two would be market rents go up. And I have not seen market rents and anchors going up. I don't think they're going up in years. Having said that, your average household income is over 100,000, there's no new supply and demand of leasing, this will be the amount of space  comparable to last year. At some point, we're going to have pretty low inventory, which means that's the point where we can start selecting tenants or we can start pushing rents.
Conor Fennerty: The only other thing I'll add, we have that in our manufacturing rent growth with the tactical projects that we talked about in last six months. So, if you look at Page 17 of our SOP , it's actually every one of those projects is a reconfiguration of space, i.e. going from anchors to shops. And so it's obviously it's small relative to our enterprise, but it really does start that up if we can kind of continue this path for a couple of years.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And just finally, the 6% sort of outstanding, you've collected 94%, whether you have in cash or deferral. The 6% outstanding, do we think about that being 6% pending vacancy or sort of split the difference; 3% vacancy, 3% that you'll collect? How should we think about that remaining 6%?
David Lukes : Alex in normal recession, if you look at tenants that don't pay rent, there's always a question mark of when is that tenant going to go away? And I think that's the basis of your question, right? How much of the unpaid is simply not going to open back up and pay rent again. But if I look back in my experience in previous recessions, I would say there's two reasons why a tenant is not paying goes away. Reason number one is, they're a bad operator, and they run out of money. Reason number two is, they're a good operator, but they don't really see a future in your property or in their business. And so they throw in the towel before things get worse. I mean, those generally are the two reasons why a non-paying tenant goes away.  With respect to the first, like I said, before, you know, if our top 50 tenants is 60% of our ABR, 41 of those are public companies, and they raised $50 billion this year, I'm not concerned about access to capital. So I don't think in our tenant roster running out of money from the tenant perspective is an issue. The second would be they don't see a bright future. And at this point, good operators that have a negative view of the future, don't sign new 10 year leases, and so it just feels like the risk of our non-paying tenants going away in this part of this particular recession seems pretty low. My caveat would be if there are sectors like full service, sit down restaurants, which is pretty small, but it's there and the theaters, those experiential types of retailers, if they're just not able to hang on because the pandemic causes a much longer tail than other types of businesses, then that's a risk. But for the most part, I feel pretty good about those tenants that aren't paying not eventually leaving.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Hong Wang with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Hong Wang: Yes. Hi, it sounds like you put a couple more tenants on a cash basis in the fourth quarter. Is that just cleaning up the roster at year end? Or are there any other troubles tenants that you could potentially put on cash basis this year? 
Conor Fennerty : Hey Hong, it's Conor, we did put some more cash basis tenant on the -- or tenant list in the fourth quarter. I think a percentage of ABR were just over 13%. I mean, over the course of the year, it's likely we could add some more. To come back to my comments, though, there's not much we're tracking on the bankruptcy front. That could change, right. But there isn't much we're tracking. So as of today, it's not a long list that we're worried about not on the cost basis. But things change, of course, you're certainly could change our view on some tenants. 
Hong Wang: Got it. And are you expecting any additional, I guess, reserve reversals or have you received any income that you've previously written off in the first quarter so far?
Conor Fennerty : We have quantified that, we will do so with first quarter results, but we absolutely have. 
Hong Wang: Got it and just to clarify is there an assumption for that sort of income in your 2021 guidance? Or is your 2020 guidance excluding that sort of stuff? 
Conor Fennerty : Excludes any reserve reversals?
Hong Wang: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Paulina Rojas Schmidt with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Good morning, could you please elaborate on the increased demand for that you're seeing for former Pier 1 boxes and between 8-K and 10-K. It would be ideal if you could please site some specific examples. And also, you mentioned that you're seeing some new concepts emerged. I'm not sure if it's for the same type of box size, but it's different. You could also elaborate on that will be appreciated. Thank you.
David Lukes : Yes. Good morning, I would say that the demand increase for the 8,000 to 10,000 square foot range is off of a pretty low base. So I wouldn't take that as being an indicator that there's sudden an outsized demand. There are a couple of tenants that recently started to grow. They are a couple of new categories. As I mentioned before, we're under NDA from a couple of new concepts. So I unfortunately can't really go into great detail about the specific types of tenants. But you know there is been a couple of tenants that are wanting to get into properties, particularly ones that are in wealthy suburbs and so the first few that they're trying are in the 8,000 to 10,000 square foot range. I think what's been more impactful, honestly, is the demand for larger boxes, you know, kind of the 25,000 to 50,000 square foot range. That's been more surprising to me. And I think there's a little bit more on the new concept front for those larger spaces than there is the 8,000 to 10,000. But it really runs the gamut. I mean, you've got some grocery concepts, you've got sporting goods concepts, you've got delivery services, you've got kind of logistic style tenants, they're taking 8,000 to 10,000 square foot space that are less retail and more logistics. There are tenants that are medically oriented. You know, a lot of people in the suburbs appear to be moving their doctors and dentists and opticians  from the cities to the suburbs, long-term, and that's propelling a lot more of kind of health and wellness. You know, a lot of the health and wellness categories seem to be kind of moving away from individual 500 square foot suites and office buildings and moving into kind of a collective health and wellness suite in the suburbs, and so that that's kind of one of those categories that filled that 8,000 to 10,000 square foot void.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. 
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. Can you just talk about high level, the sales activity that you're seeing? And I know you're on track every time and obviously, but whatever information that you do have the sales activity that you're seeing in 4Q this year versus last year. And maybe foot traffic? 
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Ki Bin, it's Connor. I mean, it's to David's point on one of the downsides of national tenants. One of them is sales and sales collections. And we get very little information on that front. I think it's just about a third of our tenants report sales. I would kind of point you back to our public tenants. That's where we get the most information. And at our anecdotes with our during our portfolio review, so I don't have great information for you there. What I would just say, though, is if you start taking down our top 50, you'll see fairly dramatic sales increases for the home improvement, home furnishing, grocery, the discounters are starting to ramp up a little bit. There is a private lager. But everyone else has put up there specific crafts business. I mean, I've been putting up 20  different comps. So we have some data on that from a couple weeks ago, or a couple months ago, see the presentation we did. But I would point you to our public tenants on that front. 
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And what was your retention ratio? It's one of those simple facts that lot of stores don't report. And I was curious if what you expect going forward in 2021? 
Conor Fennerty: You're correct. We do not report our retention ratio, I would say for anchors, it's historically better than 90% to 100% range there in your quarter. And there's nothing in our pipeline makes me think or deviate from that or shops that David's pointed it's much lower. Historically, I think it's in the 70s but my guess is now it's even lower just given fall out on the recession. So our blended is probably down marginally in the kind of 80s but for anchors, it's extremely high.
Ki Bin Kim: And in case in your guidance, you're assuming that doesn't change much or improvement? How are you thinking about that? 
Conor Fennerty: Yes, most of our anchor leases roll in the first quarter. So our visibility on that front is extremely high.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you guys. 
Operator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
Linda Tsai: Hi, what's the best way to think about dividend growth going forward?
David Lukes : The best way to think about dividend growth is that I think the board of directors is kind of thoughtfully and carefully considering what the growth rate of the dividend is. And I think all of us management and the board are looking very carefully at the durability of collections. I don't think anybody wants to get over our skis until we really see more of a conclusive end to the COVID environment. So we're really basing it on the current selections for this quarter. And I think the board will simply reconsider it every quarter and look at where collection doc.  From a long-term basis, I think there's a payout ratios we think is appropriate. You know, conserving capital for us is great because it allows us to fund a lot of leasing camp acts and hopefully some acquisitions coming up. So I think we're going to be pretty careful with the high watermark, once the collections get back to normalized, we'll be pretty careful about the high watermark for the dividend overtime.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that color. And then to clarify, you said that the least rates stay stable from Q4 levels. Does that also mean that the 290 basis points signed-but-not-occupied spread starts to compress?
Conor Fennerty: I don't think so. If you look at our slides, Linda, I think it's Page 10, or 11. We've got the sign on Page 10. We've got the sign, but not cadence of commencement. So, from a commence rate, we're really not going to see a big uptick until the back half of the year. Least rate is always really difficult to forecast. Against my comments, we're not tracking material bankruptcies at this time. To David's point, we could have some additional shop fallout  that's not material for us, but it could be a little bit of pressure. But I do think based on our leasing pipeline, it's stabilized and we're hopeful it will start to accelerate over the course of the year, but we're not willing to commit to that just yet. For the least occupied gaps -- look, in the base of our activity, like I mentioned to Michael, the pipeline David mentioned are just the anchors. Right? So, if we have additional pads and convenient to our retailers, in addition to that, you could see an acceleration or an expansion of our least occupying gap, even with the sign not open pipeline commencing in the back half. But we should. Right? We're also 90% leased. We've got a lot of rigor on that front.
Linda Tsai: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please, go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Good morning, everybody. Hey, David, just going back on the anchor retention rate number. As it relates to the leases that have no options left with them, is there a similar expectation? Or how should we be thinking about those 11 leases? I know it's a pretty small number, but just kind of thinking.
David Lukes: A similar expectation on -- I'm sorry, give me a little more -- so, what you're saying is, if an anchor tenant in our portfolio runs out of term and options and they're naked…
Chris Lucas: Right.
David Lukes: What's our expectation on retaining them versus replacing them? Is that what you mean?
Chris Lucas: Correct. Yes, exactly. Thank you.
David Lukes: Yes, I think in the recent past, because there's been so much kind of anchor churn in the past three or four years, we were more likely to retain an existing tenant that ran out a term because the CapEx is low. They have at least a proven business in that property and we can probably get a reasonable rent increase. And by reasonable, I mean kind of a traditional 10% bump. What's going to be very interesting is throughout this year, it looks like our inventory of available boxes in wealthy suburb is going to go down pretty dramatically, which means we're going to have some tough choices to make when tenants that are maybe not top tier, run out of term. And it sure feels like we might be in an environment where we start purposefully replacing tenants with better ones. And that's a pretty good spot to be in. We've done a little better than the last quarter, where we decided to not renew an existing tenant -- go ahead and take the vacancy because we want to replace them. And so, maybe there's a year and-a-half of downtime, but you end up with a much stronger long-term property. That's a good position to be in and it feels like we're kind of at the beginning of that right now. So, the retention from the tenant side might be stronger in this environment. The question is whether the landlord wants to keep that retention, or would rather replace the tenant. So, as an example in Shopper's World in Boston, there have been a number of tenants that we've decided we would like to replace them and upgrade the tenant roster because when you get these windows where anchors are active, it's best to take advantage of them because it doesn't last forever.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thank you for that. And I guess that sort of leads me to the other part of this, which is I think pre-COVID, a lot of the conversation among the national tenants was about right sizing their footprint. Is that conversation sort of put on hold right now as they sort of reevaluate how they want to work with consumers in terms of how they want to build their distribution?
David Lukes: Yes. That's one of the most fascinating subjects that I personally haven't developed a conclusive opinion on. But it is really interesting. As you know you and I have talked for years about anchors wanting to downsize their space and get more efficient. It almost feels like there have been a number of examples where that's reversed during COVID. And the reason I say that is demand for space, that's 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 square feet has increased. So, we're doing less box blitz in this last year. We're doing more full box leasing. I'm not exactly sure what the reason is. We have pulled some of their building permit drawings just to kind of look at what the new footprint looks like and it does appear that the tenants are making sure they have enough square footage to be flexible on delivery from store. And if you look at some of the new building permits, you can see the involvement of a different type of loading and delivery dock, a different type of customer pickup lane and those things take square footage. It's hard to shrink your store down to just in time inventory and at the same time want the inventory in the store. So it feels to me like that trend of shrinking footprint might be reversing a little bit.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Thank you for that. And the last question for me is now that you guys have sort of concluded the joint venture deconstruction between you and Blackstone and you've got a handful of assets on a wholly-owned basis, how should we be thinking about that group of assets that you picked up on a wholly-owned basis in terms of the long-term viability of them in your portfolio versus future disposition proceeds potentially?
David Lukes: I think you should assume the same thing with our existing core portfolio. There's going to be a handful that we sell fairly soon because we want to recycle that capital into higher growth assets. And there's a couple that have really strong tenant sales. They've got contractual rent bumps coming up or there's outparcels that we can build. So, of the nine that we've bought, I would say a third of them will probably sell fairly soon, a third of them are stable and growing at the same rate as the rest of portfolio, and the third of them have some tactical redevelopment where we can add an outparcel or subdivide box or lease in vacancy. To me, it's a proxy of our overall portfolio. We're always going to be selling the bottom couple of assets, not because they're necessarily bad or risky, but they just run out of growth. And in this industry, I think once you run out of growth, there are other ways to make money and I'd rather see it continue to recycle.
Chris Lucas: Great. Thank you for that. That's all I have this morning.
David Lukes: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much and we will speak to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending to this presentation. You may now disconnect."
51,SITC,1,2021,2021-04-22 14:15:49,"Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the SITE Centers' First Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day of Investor Relations. Mr. Day, please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Thank you operator. Good morning, and welcome to SITE Centers' first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and a slide presentation onto our website at www.sitecenters.com.
David Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We had an excellent start to the year with another quarter of near record leasing activity, continued improvement in collections and deferral payments, stabilization of our least rate, over $200 million of growth capital raised. This year already feels a lot different than 2020 and the operating environment continues to improve each week with accelerating demand for space. The company is in a fantastic position because of the work of our SITE Centers' team, so a sincere thank you to all of my colleagues for their contributions. I’ll start this morning with a summary of first quarter events, and then discuss our equity offering and our acquisition pipeline as we look to grow our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. Consistent with last quarter, 100% of our properties and 99% of our tenants remain open and operating as we continue to provide convenient access to goods and services in suburban communities. Collections continue to move higher, and as of Friday, we've collected 96% of first quarter rents. Unresolved monthly rent is now running less than 3% with the majority of remaining tenants in various forms of settlement negotiations. We continue to take a tenant by tenant methodical approach to resolving any unpaid rent, which along with deferral payments is driving continued progress on prior period collections for those who are leasing and our collections team for their incredible work this past year. If you consider the past 12 months from April 2020 through March 2021, the measure the durability of our portfolio during that time, three supportive data points have emerged. Number one, rent collection on contractual rent basis continues to move higher. We've now collected 91% of rent from April 2020 through March 2021. And after including deferrals for accrual tenants, we do expect to collect over 95% of base rents.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, David. I'll comment first on quarterly results and operating metrics, discuss revisions to 2021 guidance, and conclude with our balance sheet. First quarter results were primarily impacted by uncollectible revenue related to the pandemic. Total uncollectible revenue at SITE share was a positive $1.7 million. Included in this amount is $5 million for just over $0.02 per share of payments and that reserve rehearsals related to prior periods, primarily from past basis tenants. Outside of G&A, which was just under a $1 million benefit there were no other material onetime items that impacted the quarter. In terms of operating metrics that we strike for the portfolio was down 20 basis points sequentially. Now this was almost entirely related to the sale of anchor pad with the comparable portfolio flat. Based on minimal bankruptcy activity we're tracking today and the leasing pipeline that David outlined, we believe the lease rate has stabilized. Trailing 12-month leasing spreads are relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter with renewals impacted by strategic, short term deals that I called out last quarter as a bridge to upgrade tenancy. Based on our leasing pipeline today, we continue to expect blended leasing spreads in 2021 to be consistent with 2020 where there will be volatility given the size of our portfolio. Moving forward, we’re reviving 2021 OFFO guidance to range of $0.94 to $1.02 per share to incorporate first quarter results, including the recent equity offering. The bottom end of the range assumes no improvement in collections with continued occupancy headwinds and lower investment activity. The top half of the range assumes a steady improvement in collections that are returned to a more normalized pre-COVID operating backdrop, along with $75 million of acquisitions in the back half of this year, which includes the $50 million that David mentioned.
David Lukes: Thank you, Connor. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And the first question comes from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.
Rich Hill:
Conor Fennerty: Yes, I mean absolutely Rich. It’s Conor. So included in the first quarter, if you think about dollars that relate to prior periods, it's $5 million. And that's all flowing through the uncollectible revenue line items that the pieces of that share point, some of that are cash basis tenants, kind of coming up or catching up on prior rent. Some are cash basis deferrals. But if you're looking forward to a kind of a ramp from the first quarter to the second quarter, the way to adjust for that is just remove $5 million net uncollectible revenue item, and that will give a good runway for the second quarter.
Rich Hill: Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow up to that, and I'll jump back in the queue. It looks like your leasing velocity is really strong. And I go back to sort of some of the comments you made post the spin-off RVI, where you made a case in SITE Centers' was really well positioned with below market rents and maybe higher vacancies, but intentionally higher vacancies. So I guess the question for you guys is, is the leasing velocity that you're seeing reflective of the broader industry? Or is it something unique to SITE Centers' portfolio that you intentionally set up several years ago?
David Lukes: Rich it’s a difficult question to answer because, the sector is quite large, and we only own 78 wholly owned assets. So it's hard to comment. And I will say, when we did this  we selected assets that we felt had the ingredients to stay well occupied and be desirable for tenants and to have rent growth. And I do think that's going to be true. But I will say, at the time, I don't think any of us really anticipated that these big societal shifts would take place. And I do think these macro themes, I mean, particularly the suburban kind of movement and the kind of continued wealth, durability in wealthy suburbs, and then this kind of lingering work from home culture that it seems like it's going to have some permanence. I do think that those are tailwinds for the entire sector.
Conor Fennerty: The only thing I say Rich we are skewed, obviously towards national tenants and we talked a lot about this over the last year. The National tenants are better capitalized, they have figured out the e-commerce omni channel angle better than others. And so that is a distinct advantage for us. You kind of roll into the numbers and I think why you're hearing this level of excitement from us is we're 91.4% lease. There's no reason this portfolio can't be 95%, 96% leased. And so that's why I think you are hearing us talk about this multiyear tailwind and our confidence around that continues to grow based off the leasing pipe we have today.
Rich Hill: Okay, that's very helpful, guys. Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Katy McConnell with Citi.
Katy McConnell: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So given occupancy bar, it's been lighter than expected to date. Do you think it's bottomed out at this point? And how are you thinking about fall at risk from the small shops and a bucket at this point?
David Lukes: Katy, I'm sorry, we missed the first half that question.
Katy McConnell: I just said given occupancy fallouts been lighter than expected to date. Do you think it's bottomed out at this point?
David Lukes: I – we’re feeling like, with the least to occupied spread, right now. It's difficult to come up with a scenario where occupancy has not bottomed. I guess that's a triple negative way of saying it. But yes, it really feels like just the amount of leasing velocity is so strong. I mean, even if there were a couple more bankruptcies this year, it just feels like there's no way we're going to go backwards. And Katy, on the shop side, I mean, we're not seeing more dramatic fallout, there are some shops, but the kind of initial way that we saw a fallout has definitely tapered off quite a bit.
Katy McConnell: Okay, thanks. And then on the transaction front, are you seeing much movement in pricing or buyer competition taking up as you source new deals today?
David Lukes: Katy, the buyer competition has actually been somewhat consistent. I guess the real issue is how much inventory is out there. I mean, last year, not many assets were put on the market by sellers. And, I don't think that the, the despair showed up enough that the owners of real estate, private owners, had to sell. And so if it's their choice to sell, they're going to wait for a better time, if it does feel like the debt markets became a lot more accommodative in January. And I do think that has allowed more traditional sellers to say, hey, look that, the debt’s there, the equity is, is it's, it's been raised by both private and public companies. Now is the time to list properties. So we're seeing a little bit more activity in the past couple of months. And it's, it's competitive. It definitely is competitive.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great. Thanks.
David Lukes: Thanks, Katy.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.
Todd Thomas: Thanks. Good morning. Just first, a quick follow up on the I guess the prior period adjustments. Conor, the same store NOI growth also reflects the $5 million prior period adjustments, I believe, which I think's about a 400 basis point positive impact in the quarter. Does the better than 4% same store NOI growth that you're anticipating for the year, assume any additional prior period adjustments in future quarters?
Conor Fennerty: Yes Todd, it's Conor. It’s about the same store, it’s about 4.8 million of the 5 million is included in same store and has about a 500 basis point boost for the quarter. So apples-to-apples, same store NOI would be without prior based adjustments down about 5% or 6%. Going forward on that number, the short answer is no. I mean, guidance today does not include any other prior period adjustments.
Todd Thomas: Okay, got it. And then David, back to acquisitions. I guess a couple of questions. One, can you comment on, the types of assets that you're targeting, whether they're stabilized or, are you targeting assets with vacancy and lease up opportunities? And then can you also comment on the level of competition that you're seeing. I guess, if we think back over the last several years or more, the buyer pool for retail assets has been somewhat limited. And I'm just wondering if that's changed at all? And if you're seeing new investors or types of capital showing up today?
David Lukes: Yes, sure. I mean, Todd I can be, I can be generally specific. And that, if you think about what we've said, is working. From our perspective, it's wealthy suburban communities that tend to have lower square footage per capita. And they tend to be heavily based on convenience, the more convenient the property, the more likely the tenants want to be there. And we're seeing that with our leasing volumes. So I think that we're somewhat format agnostic, whether it's grocery non grocery strip, the format, I think, is much less important than the likelihood that rents are going to grow. So to your point about the targets. If we're targeting these three macro trends that we think our multi-year trends. And what's most important is rent growth and this is a great time to be investing early in the cycle because if you believe that rents are growing, and I do think they are, it's a good time to be coming in at this basis. So we're less focused on existing vacancies. And we're more focused on really high quality stable assets that have rent growth.
Todd Thomas: Okay, and can you just comment on the competition that you're seeing whether that's changed at all, in recent for any of these investments that you're, you're looking at compared to what you've seen, in prior years?
David Lukes: Yes, I guess it's not, there's not quite enough activity yet to be able to say whether there's more capital out there. It feels like there is. It feels like, a lot of private investors have started to realize that cash flow growth is happening. And part of the reason for that, Todd is that, I think, I think the viewpoint a couple of years ago on the sector was that it had a high percentage of CapEx, at least in CapEx. But if you go into a rent growth scenario for the next couple of years, and you have stabilized properties, the CapEx is going to drop pretty fast, because you just simply can't spend enough CapEx if you don't have vacancies. And so it becomes a renewal business where the renewal spreads are high and the CapEx is low. I think that's the cycle we're heading into. And I think it's not lost on a lot of private capital. So when we've been out bidding on properties, we definitely think we're competing with kind of, core plus type of capital in the in the private sector.
Todd Thomas: Okay, thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning, morning, bright and early. So just a few questions here. First, Conor, on the cash tenants, obviously, we all love cash. And it's great to get paid cash. But as we think about your full year, numbers, how much how, how as a percent to ABR, however, NOI, however you want to gauge it? How many of your tenants are now cash? And what is that delta? Meaning if you collected 5 million in the quarter was that you were you build 5 million attachments, you got paid 5 million. So we can think about 5 million benefits in the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, etcetera? Or how do we think about this the cash and how it's going to impact earnings?
David Lukes: Yes. Alex, good morning. So 13% of our tenants are on cash basis accounting. So in terms of numbers, it's unchanged, subtracted from year end, I think we could make a count of one handheld unit tested this last quarter, so no material change in the pool. If you think about coming back to Rich's question, and how that was their income statement. Cash basis collections, were about 80% in the first quarter. And so if that, that that collection rate was unchanged in the second quarter at 80%, you would see our uncollectible revenue from the first quarter number minus 5 million, so call it round numbers about negative $3.5 million. That would be what the kind of drag would be on earnings, or FFO, assuming the same pool and the same collection rate. Now the problem is the pool may change, right? We may take some folks off cash basis accounting, the odds of that being a payer though, or we want the steady state of collecting for that period. So I don't think that materially impact. But there could be some follow on as well, some copies of tenants aren't paying, we're in litigation, or we're going to do something with and they're out. So it's a really long way of saying it's going to change the pool will change. But I think from a run rate perspective for you, if you just take the current uncollectible revenue from the first quarter, knock out 5 million and assume if you assume no improvement in collections, that's a good number to use going forward.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, so for those of us still on the first cup of coffee, Conor. So the 5 million that you booked in the first quarter, is is your full year guidance, the you know, the 94 to $1.02 is that assuming 5 million benefits in the second quarter, third quarter fourth quarter, or is not assuming that?
Conor Fennerty: There's no there's no prior period adjustments and guidance for the rest of the year. So looking at the trends, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are trending towards the top end of the range, right? We're seeing a steady improvement in leasing activity. We're seeing a steady improvement in collections. The bottom end of the range assumes that deterioration and occupancy which is what we're seeing, but it's April 22, we're trying to be prudent, we're in the middle of pandemic. So any other prior period reversal analysis would be good guys to turn earnings into guidance.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, so the simple answer is that if you get another 5 million in the next each quarter, you're going to be at/or or above the top end of guidance. Correct? That's how the math works.
Conor Fennerty: If we got in $5 million a quarter for the next three quarters, we'd be above the guidance range.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, awesome. Okay. Second question is going back to active…
Conor Fennerty: But I'm just going to have to say Alex is just I mean, those are cash basis tenants. Right? So implicitly, we don't expect to collect that. Right. So that's a, that's a big yes, right? 
Alexander Goldfarb: Yes, but things are getting better. So okay. A second question is on acquisitions. Just given where you guys are trading on implied cap rates, sort of on our numbers, high sixes. And the fact that it sounds like cap rates for assets are going to continue to compress? How do you, how do you think about making the math work, as far as using your currency to buy assets. And as part of that, David, you emphasize the benefit of national credit. But at the same time, you guys have been willing to buy Centers that are sort of, not anchored, more smaller neighborhood type centers, which I would assume would have more small shops. So how do we think about, sort of the balance of buying Centers with preponderance of National Credit versus infill in the neighborhoods you want in to competing with your cost of capital versus, where cap rates probably are in the market, which I'm assuming is inside of where you guys are trading?
David Lukes: Yes. It's a great question. And since I've had three cups of coffee, I can answer it quickly. I think that, Alex the way that I'm looking at it is from an unlevered IRR perspective. And the thing to remember about cap rate compression is there's a reason and the reason is, market rents are growing, and CapEx is going down. And those two functions in the IRR do make a tremendous difference. So as I look at our cost of capital, I would still like to see us make acquisitions that are approaching that round numbers 10% unlevered IRR. And it may be that you can get that in the mid six cap rate, it may be that you can get that at a low five cap rate. But I do think that if we're selecting the right assets in the right sub markets, and we have confidence that there's rent growth, natural rent growth on renewals, that's a big piece of the function. So tilting to what you mentioned about format type. I don't think we're against any format and acquisitions, as long as it's it kind of targets the sub market and the rent growth profile that that we think is, is available to us. Most of the acquisitions we've made in smaller neighborhood centers do have a pretty sizable component of National Credit tenants. The, the Horizons, the Starbucks, the banks, those types of tenants are active in in wealthy suburban communities. And those are the properties that tend to drive a lot of convenience traffic and can boost market rents over time, the real difference between them and a larger format asset is they tend to control the real estate for a shorter duration. Some of these boxes have 20, 30 years of term with options. That's not necessarily the case in the smaller assets, even if you have credit, but you're able to access the rent growth a lot faster than you can with larger boxes.
Conor Fennerty: Now, the only other thing I would say on kind of accretion, accretion dilution is they've been a common market, we have north of $40 million of retained down. So now, we also have the RBI prowess. So there are a number of sources of capital we have where we can we can invest and not worry about over -- for the dilution. The other comment that you made is we referenced accretive dispositions, meaning selling at a lower spreads than what we're buying. So I would just tell you, we're incredibly focused on earnings growth, along with intrinsic value growth. So don't think we were buying just for the sake of buying and we're not we're not focused on earnings growth.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, cool. Listen, thank you. Thank you, Connor. Thank you, David.
David Lukes: Thanks, Al.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore.
Samir Khanal: Hey, good morning, everyone. David, just curious I mean, how do you think about the long term growth of the portfolio coming out of the pandemic here? I know you talked about anchor leasing that peak levels, you've talked about shifts you are seeing kind of, kind of during the pandemic, so as we think about the long term growth, I know, I kind of, if you look back, for the portfolio, I believe that, for the investor day, I think it was like 2.5% or something back in 2019. Maybe it's still early, but just we'll kind of want to get your initial thoughts of the kind of thing about recovery.
David Lukes: Yes, it's a it's a, it's a really interesting question, because I think at the time that we had our investor day conference, the macro trends were different. If you remember that 2.5% growth included 150 basis points of bankruptcy every year because we were in an environment where there was a lot of retailer churn. And we also assumed a pretty heavy CapEx burn in order to make that, in order to basically keep occupancy and keep a little bit of growth but it had a cost to it. What's really changed in the last maybe since September, October last year, is that the amount of leasing from large box and small shop tenants, particularly on the national side has been so robust, and surprisingly so that I think that the growth rate is higher than we originally thought and the bankruptcy rate is lower. And whether that continues for 10 years or for two or three years, I guess we'll find out. But it sure feels like if you look at 2022 versus 2019 portfolio, NOI portfolio, it feels like there's a bull case emerging where 22 is going to surpass 19 highs. And I think it comes back to Katy's questions about occupancy. If occupancy is not deteriorating rents are growing, then it really means that 2022 is shaping up to be, likely it at least, at least even likely better than 19 was.
Samir Khanal: I guess, as a follow up, you think about, NOI growth and maybe the breakdown of that, is there anything that's changed on the contractual rent bump side, is it kind of still that sort of, one percentage for anchor boxes? Or are you getting more than that to say?
David Lukes: Well, I'm uncertain shops, or nine credit tenants, I think getting higher bumps is, is achievable. We've been getting higher bumps than normal on the smaller shop deals for sure. The differences were 90% credit National Credit tenants. And so our existing portfolio doesn't benefit quite as much from those tenants that can sign annual bumps. One, one thing you could look at, it's kind of interesting. If you look at page 14 of our sub, we did add a little bit of disclosure, which I think you'll find interesting, you're looking at the sign but not open pipeline of leases, compared to the lease expiration schedule of the existing portfolio. And what it shows is there's a delta, the rents are higher in the box, the box average for the lease we've signed to date in the last 22 they are not open is about almost 17 bucks a foot and the existing is about 14. So you're seeing a natural spread on the on the new leases, both for shops and anchors. And the compounding nature of those, when they hit their options is helpful. But to your point, the industry I don't think has changed in terms of it naturally is, 10% growth every five years for anchors, and it's kind of 2% to 3% growth for shops. And I don't see that changing dramatically, which is why we like acquiring properties and have near term expirations because that's really where the growth is going to come from.
Samir Khanal: Right. That's very helpful. Thanks so much.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. You've spoken about the Steinmart boxes having solid releasing upside but maybe more pressure on the Pier 1 boxes. Is this still the case for Pier 1 in the context of the leasing strength you're describing?
David Lukes: I think generally it is Linda I mean, I think we talked about 300%, 400% market on some of the Steinmart boxes. We just got back to the end of last year. So but I would say that's generally consistent. On Pier One, I would say it's marginally better. There are we've talked about some new concepts in that eight to 10 square footage range last quarter. So medical users, a couple of new concepts and that exact eight to 10,000 square feet. So I would say it's marginally better. But in general, it's fairly consistent with prior periods.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then on micro-fulfillment, and the build out of these platforms to the extent that's happening in your portfolio, and it reinforces the value of that distribution point. Are landlords helping to pay out for these build out costs, or is it the retailers?
David Lukes: I think it's generally the retailers. I mean, if you look at this, the CapEx that's been required to do anchor leases, it is kind of noteworthy. I mean, we've been signing leases with a CapEx, which is not inconsistent at all with previous years. I think we're averaging around $40 a square foot on average. So I don't think that we've seen any additional costs for the tenants to change the interior of their space. But we have noticed it, Linda. I mean, we've seen some of the permit drawings. Every time a tenant goes in, they have to submit permit drawings to the city. We're able to get a copy of those drawings and review them and you do see some changes on the interior of the store related to a little bit larger sorting areas a little bit smaller customer areas, a big tilt towards customer pickup areas in the parking field and how that interaction occurs. So I feel like the cost is being borne from the tenant side at this point. But it is interesting to note and I agree with you that is happening.
Linda Tsai: Just one last one. The 15 million under contract are those in regions where your properties are already or you kind of market agnostic.
David Lukes: They are in regions where we already have staff and in portfolio.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point.
Floris van Dijkum: Morning, thanks for taking my question, guys. Obviously, very encouraging, report net effect of rents are up. The pipeline seems to be strong. I’m intrigued by your comment about going on offense, obviously your balance sheet is in decent shape now as well. Are you guys also thinking about JVs as a way to buy to buy assets and maybe if you could provide some, some commentary on your view of the Kimco transaction, changing the sentiment perhaps in the sector, for other investors as well as yourself?
David Lukes: Sure, Floris, I happen to -- be sorry, apparently three cups of coffee wasn't enough. The company, this company has a long history of joint ventures. And I do think that it's always going to be a part of our platform, but it has to be for a purpose. And if you look at the JVs we've done in the past couple of years, it the purpose, it has been a recap of a portfolio so that we could recycle capital. The need to do that before was to delever our balance sheet and kind of prepare for bad times, which turned out to be a good move. I think at this point, we do have capital to invest from multiple sources. And at this point, I think we are continuing to invest on balance sheets. But I'm certainly not out of favor with doing, venture as long as they have a purpose. And that purpose could be the partner brings you a deal and they want to be involved with a REIT, it could be that the scale of the opportunity we find is simply too big for us. And we'd like to have a partner. So there can be multiple reasons, and I'm not against it. And I think you can assume that, we'll be very careful about it. But we're open to joint ventures. From the from the industry standpoint, with the Kimco Weingarten announcement. I mean, I do think it was positive for the industry, I agree with you that it seems to have stoked a little bit of animal spirits. Because it's a, it's a big deal. And it's positive for the industry, the pricing, I thought was a particularly a pretty good read through, because I do think it's a bit more consistent with where private market pricing is. So it's felt like validation of that. And the other thing I think is interesting is that, if you look under the hood, the Weingarten portfolio does have quite a few similarities to the SITE Center portfolio. We have similar ABR per square foot, we have similar grocery sales volumes, we've got similar demographics of I think we're talking a little bit higher household income. And if you really carefully look through the portfolios, you'll see that we have a pretty similar mix between grocery anchored and power center. So I thought it was great for the industry. And I particularly thought it was it was kind of a good read through for us.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, David. And do you expect that there'll be additional transactions like that, in your view, do you think this is, sort of awaken people to the possibility and where do you see or how do you see yourself at position in such a situation?
David Lukes: I think your guess is as good as mine, whether there's more public activity. I certainly think there's going to be more private activity. I mean, the amount of private capital that's looking for yield and they're starting to see durability. But durability is what I think was proven over the past 12 months. I mean, for us to be having collected 91% of rent through a pandemic is it's impressive. And I think the industry has proven quite a bit of durability. But now I think you're starting to see growth. And whenever you get market rents growing in a sector, I do think the private capital starts to raise its head and it feels like we're getting into that period. I think we'll see because there haven't been a lot of private capital investments to date. But we'll see over the next couple of months.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, David.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Miller with JPMorgan.
Michael Miller: Yes hi, David a couple of quick questions here. First, did you mention the cap rate on the $50 million that you have lined up for Acquisition?
David Lukes: I did not. But I did say that, once we close, we would be happy to talk a bit more about unlevered IRR, I think it's probably a better way to look at it personally. But I think once we close on the acquisitions, we'd be happy to walk through the reason and the rationale and the investment thesis. But I'd like to kind of punt on that for now, Mike.
Michael Miller: Got it. And then you talked a little bit about, properties that are more convenient, having better growth potential. And just curious, if you look at a market or sub market, what makes in your eyes, one property more convenient than, than the other?
David Lukes: It feels like the, the most of the tenants have decided that proximity to the street with visibility. And access is really important. What we've been measuring, as a couple of things. We've been measuring traffic counts, because during the pandemic, you have so many more people in suburban communities that are home all the time, the traffic patterns have changed. They're not as dramatic on a Saturday and Sunday, but they're much more dramatically positive on a Tuesday or Wednesday. So we're being very thoughtful about tracking, geolocation, cell phone mobility, and we can kind of witness how communities are acting when they're home five days a week, seven days a week. It tells you something. And then tenants are seeing it as well. So I would say traffic patterns are simply the amount of people that are nearby the property and then relate that to how much square footage per capita is in the market. That's really why I like wealthy sub markets, because they tend to have much stricter zoning laws, and so the supply is less. And the result of that Mike is pretty amazing. And we've had a couple of shop deals, we find the last couple of months that are approaching $100 a foot in suburban strip centers. Our average shop rent right now in the portfolio is 2850. So that's what I mean, where I'm saying we are definitely in a period where convenience is extremely desirable, and the tenants are willing to pay for it. And to me, that's a good time to be investing if you're seeing the beginning of that cycle.
Michael Miller: Got it? And maybe one last one, Conor for the 3.3 million reserves, kind of the clean number which is stripped out prior period. Can you just give us a like a rough breakdown of what's making up that 3 million in terms of categories?
Conor Fennerty: Yes, it's a mixed Mike. I mean, obviously, it's if you look at our, our deck on categories that are open, it's not surprising. The laggards are more COVID sensitive. So fitness, theatres, entertainment. So it's a little bit of mix. I would say in that are some some local names that we expect to pull out, like, like I mentioned. And it's just a question of land and we've got the right backfill in place, it's so you can see how the survivorship lies, that number shrink over the next couple quarters. So there's not one sector Mike that's jumping out, but it's the kind of the same, the same genres or same categories that we've seen over the last year.
Michael Miller: Got it? Okay, that was it. Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks Michael.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One.
Chris Lucas: Good morning, guys. David, just sort of a big picture question as it relates to the inflation outlook. Does that impact at all how you think about you're retaining mix for things that you're looking at in terms of acquisitions? Or is it sort of too, too early in the process of seeing reflation to sort of make that an important part of this analysis?
David Lukes: You mean, consumer inflation, Chris?
Chris Lucas: Correct, correct. Yes, that's an asset.
David Lukes: Yes, I yes, you would probably agree or not be surprised that there's, there's two pieces of inflation, that I think are really important. One is a risk and one is a benefit. But one of the risks of inflation is the long duration leases that tend to be flattish. They tend to get, they can't keep up. And that's why sometimes these convenient properties that have shorter duration leases are a lot easier to raise rent during an inflation and keep up with market and market rents are growing. So that's a good time to be finding acquisitions where we know we can adjust the rent roll a little bit sooner, once it's fully occupied. I think the second piece of the puzzle is is really interesting, and that is if you have a lot of National Credit tenants, and they sign a lease with a certain occupancy cost ratio. And five years later, they're still paying the same rent but their sales have escalated with inflation. What's happened while the landlord hasn't benefited because we don't have percentage rent clauses. Having said that, their occupancy cost ratio is much lower. And so I think what's going to happen as the probability of options being exercised, will go up if you see more inflation. And so that does reduce the amount of future CapEx and future tenant burns, because they're simply more profitable in place. So we do think about those quite a bit, particularly on our acquisitions. And I think it would be marginally positive. The downside, of course, is exit cap rate, and what's the effect on cap rate? So I think that's, that's kind of the two sides of the coin that we think about.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thank you for that. I guess you've sort of opened up Pandora's box when you talked about occupancy costs. And what I'm getting at is, how are you guys dealing with the sort of sales in store versus, e-commerce, this whole omni channel and how that impacts essentially, what sales are at a specific unit and how retailers sort of pushing back on how they were thinking about it?
David Lukes: Yes, I feel it's an issue that I know we many people in the industry have been talking about for a number of years. And the good news is, we have almost moved so little percentage rent in the company that we just don't have to deal with it. But I agree with you that it is a challenge.
Chris Lucas: But that ultimately drives rents, right? I mean, the occupancy cost is an important factor just as you described before. So it's something that's…
Conor Fennerty: Right to David's point, we have very little overdraft. And then on top of that, only about 30% of our tenants report sales, right? So it's just not a big part of our business. Now, if we do get sales, does it muddy the water, whether you have a click and collect included in our return included? Absolutely. So to David's point, it's a focus of ours, but it's not necessarily it’s impacting our day to day business.
David Lukes: The other thing to remember is that it's – if you’re thinking about occupancy cost should drive the rent that a tenant is willing to pay. But it doesn't really drive market rents, because that has more to do with what the other tenants are willing to pay for the same space. And given the amount of box leasing activity going on there is competition brewing. And so I think it has market rents have more to do with multiple people seeking the same space. And that's a good situation to be in.
Chris Lucas: Sure. Conor, kind of want to have you, can you help me sort of looking at the sign not opened chart from last quarter, and I'm comparing it to this quarter, it feels like just looking at it adjusting for the 2.8 million that you brought on board in the first quarter, looks like there's some more ramp to third and fourth quarter of this year, compared to where you were in the prior period. Is that related to some faster delivery of space? Or is that related to just more leases signed in the interim?
Conor Fennerty: I would say it's a little bit of both Chris. So one, we have more visibility on just rent commencements or and or more confidence. And the second to your point is probably a bunch of shops that we think we can get opened this year to David's point, signing $70 $89 foot shops. They turned into kind of mini anchors, right in terms of their contribution. So that's probably the two factors driving away. We can dig into that and come back to you, but that's my gut.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thank you. That's what I had this morning. Appreciate it.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Tammy  with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. I guess maybe just following up on the recent transaction between Kimco Weingarten. And I guess, are you sort of satisfied with the scale and efficiencies of your current size? Or do you see real benefits from being a larger company in the shopping center industry? And then correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're looking to be a net acquire this year. So I'm sort of curious if you have a five year target in terms of size, or is the plan just to be opportunistic, depending on market conditions? Thank you.
David Lukes: Hi, Tammy. It's a great question. Given the announcement of that merger, I think what we're most happy with is the runway we have in the near term. And by near term, I mean, probably two or three years. It just, it feels like we've got a lot of growth runway, our balance sheets in really good shape. We don't have any commitments for development. We haven't committed to, high CapEx, mixed use properties. And I really feel like we're in a position where we can make external investments for high quality properties with cash that's coming from multiple sources. So it feels like we're in a really good spot. And, and back to your question of scale, the G&A load of this company can be flexed quite a bit, and so it feels like we're going to get the benefit of being able to grow without having to increase our G&A. And that's a good spot to be. So I do think there's a benefit to scale. And I think we're beginning to get more scale over the next couple of years. So yes, I guess I would leave it at that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks. And then I'm just wondering, are you actively marketing any assets for sale today?
David Lukes: We are always actively marketing one or two. I mean, last quarter, we sold a single tenant box pad that was across the street from our main shopping center. There are a few assets that once they get to be 100%, leased, they've got long term credit tenants, it's more likely that there's an arbitrage between what the private market is willing to pay for that flat lease and what we would like to recycle that capital into. So there's always a little bit of recycling, but it's not meaningful.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Tammy.
Operator: Thank you. And that does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to return the floor to David Lukes for any closing comments.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for your time. And we will speak to you next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."
52,SITC,2,2021,2021-07-30 02:10:44,"Operator: Good day and welcome to the SITE Centers’ Second Quarter 2021 Operating Results. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brandon Day of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Brandon Day: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to SITE Centers’ second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and slide presentation onto our website at www.sitecenters.com, which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today’s call. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and in our filings with the SEC including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO, operating FFO and same store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today’s quarterly financial supplement. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. We had another very strong quarter with results well ahead of our expectations, and the deployment of nearly $50 million of external investments. Leasing activity remains robust. And we’re seeing the early signs of that velocity in our lease rate, which will flow through in future periods. I’ll start this morning with a summary of our second quarter events, talk briefly about operations and then discuss our investments and our capital as we look to grow our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. Our properties remain 100% open and customer traffic continues to grow. Collections and deferral repayments also continue to trend higher. And as of the 21st, we’ve collected 98% of second quarter rents. We’ve also collected nearly 100% of the deferral payments due to date, which when applied to last year’s rent, means that we’ve now collected 95% of contract rent for the calendar year 2020. The durability of our portfolio cash flow and the elevated level of demand for space at our assets speaks to the quality of our team and our real estate. Included in the 95% of 2020 base rent collected to date are $5.4 million of deferral payments from cash basis tenants. This is a positive onetime benefit to us, including $3 million in the second quarter and speaks to 2 things: first, the success of our methodical tenant-by-tenant approach to resolving unpaid rent; and second, the strength of the credit profile of our national tenants, which make up 90% of our base rent.
Conor Fennerty: Thank you, David. I’ll comment first on quarterly results, discuss revisions to 2021 guidance and second half earnings considerations and conclude with our balance sheet. Second quarter results were primarily impacted by uncollectible revenue related to the pandemic. Total uncollectible revenue at SITE share included $7.6 million of income, or almost $0.04 per share from payments and net reserve reversals related to prior periods primarily from cash basis tenants. Outside of this COVID related impact, there were no other material one-time items that impacted the quarter. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was up 40 basis points sequentially, which is consistent with our commentary since the start of the year that we believe that portfolio occupancy has bottomed. Based on minimal bankruptcy activity that we are tracking today and the leasing pipeline that David outlined, we believe the lease rate will continue to grind higher over the course of the year. We provide an updated schedule an expected ramp of our $11 million signed, but not open pipeline on Page 9 of our earnings slide. We had 299,000 square feet, or $7 million of annualized base rent commencements in the second quarter. And the SNO pipeline now represents about 3% of annualized second quarter base rent. If you’re also include the unsigned anchors in various stages in negotiation that David referenced, and all of the leases, the total leasing pipeline remains about 5% of our base rent as new activity remains strong. Moving on to guidance, we’re revising 2021 OFFO guidance to a range of $1.06 to $1.10 per share, to incorporate first half results, including recent acquisitions, without performance driven by prior period reversals, earlier rent commencements and higher retention. The bottom end of the range assumes stable collections and occupancy and no additional investment activity. The top end of the range assumes continued improvement collections and a return to a more normalized pre-COVID operating backdrop, along with $25 million of additional acquisitions.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question today will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Richard Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. First of all, congrats on a really nice quarter and doing exactly what you said you were going to do. I want to maybe just unpack some moving parts as it relates to RVI wind-down and the buying of new assets. So first, Conor, maybe you can just refresh us, how long do your RVI management fees remain in place once RVI is wound down? I thought it was like a quarter or maybe 6 months after the wind down. But can you just refresh us on that?
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Rich, so if you recall the fees are reset effectively every 6 months. So there are some nuances when the last asset is sold. But I would just tell you that effectively June 30 and December 31, if we own an asset that will kind of impact the next 6 months of fees. So to my comments, I think I said we have – we expect $3.5 million per quarter in the third and the fourth quarter this year. That would obviously be lower, if and when Puerto Rico is sold. So it implies a lower run rate for the first half of next year. I think to your point, the big factor is going to be the reinvestment of proceeds. That will be the ultimate driver, I think of kind of the OFFO impact from RVI’s asset sales.
Richard Hill: Yeah, that’s helpful. And just thinking about the acquisitions for a second, where do you see acquisition cap rates going right now? I mean, you guys obviously have a lot of insight given what’s happening with RVI and what you’re doing in the acquisition market specifically with SITE Centers? But is it – can you can you buy at 5.5? Is it tighter? Is it wider? What are you thinking about here now?
David Lukes: Rich, it’s David. It feels like we’ve been pretty active in underwriting for the last six months. And it feels like, whereas cap rates 6 months ago were kind of low 6s, high 5s for the type of assets that we would like to buy. It feels like they’re kind of low- to mid-5s at this point. I think what’s really driving that is the underwriting is allowing more rent growth. And so, when buyers are looking at the unlevered IRR, they’re able to pay more today for the asset because the growth is higher than people thought it was 6 months ago. And so, I think that’s really what’s impacting the cap rate.
Richard Hill: Helpful. And then, Conor, just one more question. You’ve done a really nice job of moving your leverage down to a really conservative level. Where would you be comfortable taking that to, as you think about becoming more on the offensive over the next several quarters, several years and buying assets?
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Rich, it’s a good question. We haven’t talked about it in a while, because to your point, we’ve been so focused on getting leverage back to where it was to pre-COVID levels. We’re running effectively in the low-5 area today. Our range, we talked about pre-COVID was a 5 to 6 times debt-to-EDITDA range. Look, if we saw the right opportunity, would we move to the top end of the range? Sure. But I would just tell you, we’re as focused on leverage as we are on duration. So if we’ve got the right runway, in terms of debt maturities, I think we’d feel comfortable at the high end of the range. But otherwise, I think you’d expect us to stay kind of in that midpoint to the low-end of the range. But again, it just dependent on opportunities. The nice part is, I mean, our access to capital or the amount of capital we have on hand is substantial, right? With the cash, the ATM proceeds, the RVI preferred. I mean, it’s a pretty dramatic amount of liquidity relative to our enterprise value.
Richard Hill: Yeah. So just one more question for me. And that’s really helpful, Conor. David, you’ve been pretty – I don’t want to say vocal. Those are my words, not yours. But you’ve been talking about recovery to normal by the end of 2022. Hopefully, I’m not putting words in your mouth. This was a really strong quarter. It feels like things are just getting better from here. Is there any chance that’s pulled up? Or do you feel still very confident that that’s 2022 and not mid 2022 or early 2022?
David Lukes: You mean, in terms of Same Store NOI being back to 2019 levels, is that what you mean?
Richard Hill: Yeah, or total NOI, however, you think about a normalization prior to pre-COVID levels. We look at it in terms of total NOI, but however, you would frame that.
David Lukes: Yeah, I think a lot has changed, Rich. I mean, in my own mind, this is my own memory, I think two quarters ago, I said it really feels like 2022 is the year, where things are kind of moving back to, to get to 2019. I think last quarter, I said there’s an emerging bull case, where if we don’t have that many bankruptcies and we have a higher percentage of tenants hitting their options and we have a lot of leasing momentum going forward, it feels like the bull case is that the kind of back to 2019 levels happens faster than what we previously thought. And I would say all 3 of those things are true. As of today, we’ve had a much higher percentage of tenants hitting their options. So therefore, our downtime is less, we’ve had a lot more leasing than I would have expected. And it really does feel like. I mean, I think if you look at our introduction of same-store guidance for this year, what we’re effectively saying is that this year we’re going to claw back to 2019 levels, which means 2022 is likely to be higher.
Richard Hill: All very helpful. Thanks, guys. That’s it for me. Congrats on a great quarter again.
David Lukes: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: And our next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just going back to investments, it seems like activities picking up a little bit. You’re not far from the $75 million goal for the year. And, you talked about the outlook around the repayment of the $190 RVI pref, which improved considerably and gives you some capital to deploy. Can you just talk a little bit more about the investment pipeline today and how we should think about the timing of redeploying those proceeds? And the expected returns that you might generate?
David Lukes: It’s a really great question, Todd. I wish I had a succinct answer on the timing. I mean, the fact of matter is, we are in a position now where we have capital to invest. And as you well know there’s a long history of, that’s when management teams get into trouble, because you’ve got capital burning a hole in your pocket. So I think you’ll see us be very careful to try and buy the properties that we feel have long-term stable growth. I would say at this point in the cycle, to me, that means core assets that have rents that are below market or core assets that have near-term maturities where you can have a mark to market. So an example of the Delray property we just bought, we are signing leases now at our Miami properties, shop leases that are north of 70 or 80 bucks a foot. And all of the asset leases in Addison place in Delray are kind of in the 30s and 40s. So we feel like there is near-term maturities. There’s a great mark to market, and therefore, the growth is going to be there. So the more assets like that we can find, our pipeline will pick up. But I will tell you, we’re going to be very picky going forward on acquisitions.
Todd Thomas: And so, I guess, when we think about future investments for SITE Centers here, it sounds like we should – is it fair to assume that we should expect almost exclusively to see the company targeting these convenience oriented assets that you’re describing? Or are you seeing other opportunities to generate the rent growth and returns that you’re targeting in more traditional anchored or multi-anchored centers?
David Lukes: I think we’re very intrigued by a lot of the unanchored convenience type properties that we’ve been looking at. And we have been pretty active in that sub-sector. I would not say it’s exclusively there. If we can find larger centers to buy that we believe the rent roll has some durability and some growth to it. And that’s great. It’s just have been a little bit harder to find those properties. Part of the reason I do think is that, if you’re a seller, today is not a time where you’re going to sell vacancy. There’s too much tenant activity. There’s too much tenant demand. I mean, everybody has a ton of leasing activity. And so, if you’re a seller, you’re not going to sell a vacancy into that market, you’re going to try and get it leased up. And that’s why I think the inventory so far of larger properties has been a little bit less. And we’re going to be very careful in those larger rent rolls, to make sure that we don’t have any negative mark to market spreads. And it’s a lot easier to figure that out on these smaller properties.
Todd Thomas: Okay, and then, just last question, I guess, the company has completed a few – during the quarter, the company completed a few unconsolidated dispositions and RVI is winding down or liquidating. And so, the JV or asset management platforms continue to decline in size. Curious what the appetite is to form a new partnership for growth, a new investment vehicle, whether there’s appetite like that today on your end, and also, within the institutional or sovereign wealth market?
David Lukes: Sure, well, let’s take our end first. As you can imagine, relative to 4 years ago, this company has a very simple story right now. I mean, our supplemental is getting easier to read, because there are fewer redevelopments, there are fewer JVs, there are fewer JV fees, the spin seems to be winding down. So I like the simplicity right now. We have capital. We have access to capital. We’ve got leasing to do. It feels like just blocking and tackling is a nice way to just generate some internal growth. If we do another joint venture, which I’m not opposed to at all, I think it just has to serve a purpose. And that purpose is probably recycling capital out of assets that we’ve kind of leased up to a slower growth. So they become durable, but less growthy, and we can recycle capital. That was effectively the strategy with our dividend trust portfolio with some Chinese investors a few years ago. I think that’s a high hurdle that we would hit by doing that type of deal again. So now let’s switch gears to your second half of your question, which is on the institutional side. There is no question that there’s been more money moving into the sector in the last 6 months. I mean, John is sitting here with me. He’s been dealing with lots of sellers over the last couple of months, and we are starting to see more insurance money, pension money, more institutional capital, kind of looking into the sector and making acquisitions. But we haven’t really found a partner that we think would be right for a recap. And so, I think we’re just going to continue on the strategy we have right now, which is to use our own capital and lease our own spaces.
Todd Thomas: Okay, all right. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Rich – Todd.
Operator: And our next question will come from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please go ahead.
Katy McConnell: Great, thank you. So following the Puerto Rico sales from RVI, can you discuss the GAV of the assets that’ll be left afterwards? And also, how the sale could impact your overall G&A load?
David Lukes: Katy, I’m sorry, I could barely hear you. Did you say what’s the GAV of the remaining RVI assets post the Puerto Rico sale, is that what you said?
Katy McConnell: Yeah, that’s right. And then, also just how the sale could impact your overall G&A load?
David Lukes: Okay, I can answer the second half, which is, the way that I think you look for G&A this year is, by the time this deal closes, if everything happens according to plan, you’re already down to the last couple of months a year. And so, when you take into effect severance and other wind-down costs of our office there, I don’t see any real material change to our G&A budget for calendar year 2021. For 2022, there could be some G&A changes. But I think when we give guidance for 2022, that’s when we’ll incorporate that into our G&A load. But I don’t think it’s significant. I think that the bigger issue is what happens to the fees that we’re getting and less about the G&A. As far as the GAV of the remaining 8 assets in the RVI, the company doesn’t give values for their properties. And again, they’re managed by us, but they’re not owned by us. So I can’t really comment on the value of the 8 remaining properties.
Katy McConnell: Okay, got it. Thanks. And then, assuming cap rates on new acquisitions remain lower than you’re comfortable with, how are you thinking about other priorities for deploying the preferred proceeds in the near term?
David Lukes: I guess, I wouldn’t say that they’re lower than I’m comfortable with, because if the growth is there, I think going-in cap rate is a little bit less relevant. And we have been seeing properties. I mean, we’ve been buying assets that have a 3% to 4% CAGR for the next 5 years. And so, I think that does merit having a lower going-in cap rate. I think that’s really the reason why you’re seeing cap rates compress for many of the things we’re looking at, because the rent growth is there. So it’s not that I’m uncomfortable with it. Other uses of capital, we do have JVs that sometimes the JV partners want to sell and sometimes there are assets we want to buy. And that can be a good source of inventory for us. We have a remaining preferred that’s still out there. So I think there’s other things that we can do with our capital. I think we have enough choices to make some good decisions over the next year.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great. Thanks.
David Lukes: Thanks, Katy.
Operator: And our next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Hey, Conor. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just curious on what you’re seeing on the shop space. I mean, the anchor space leasing is healthy, but kind of, well, how does the recovery in shop space look for you guys?
Conor Fennerty: Pretty…
David Lukes: We’re both excited to answer it. So we’re fighting over who gets to. But…
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Samir, I – go ahead, David.
David Lukes: You know what’s really interesting, Samir, is that we’ve been talking about box demand for the last 6 months. But when you look at our production this quarter, half of our leasing activity was shops. And it is kind of exciting, because if you look at the total deals done, half were anchors, half were shops, that’s a little unique. I mean, that really does mean that shop leasing has picked up materially in the last quarter or two. The second thing that’s interesting is about 83% of those deals are national credit. And so to me, it means that there’s a theme that’s kind of emerging right now, which I think is that the local tenants have struggled during the pandemic, may have provided an opportunity for well capitalized national tenants to get into the better assets. And they’re doing it quickly. I mean, I look at the number of deals we’re doing with national credit shop tenants, it does seem to be growing.
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Samir, we highlighted this a little bit at NARIET in June, about the opportunity we have in the shop size. And to David’s point, we’re starting to see kind of the fruits of some of our efforts. So it definitely is a, I would say a significant source of upside for us. And the exciting part is less capital and a quicker usually rent commencement date as well. So to David’s point, a big part of our volumes, and they were excited about and then a number of national credits, a few of which are first to portfolio for us, which is even more exciting.
Samir Khanal: And then, I guess, just on the demand side, I mean, it’s clearly been very robust here. And, I mean, are you seeing differences maybe from a geographic standpoint? I mean, when retailers are coming to you to open stores, I mean, are they targeting certain areas like first ring suburbs, formats. I mean, what are you sort of seeing on that site? What are the trends?
David Lukes: Well, we really only have 2 or 3 urban assets. And there’s no question that those have been slower. And I think that you whether it’s southeast or northeast or west coast, honestly, it feels like the box in the shop leasing has more to do with getting into the right ZIP code, the wealthier ZIP code in the right intersection and less to do about region. So I don’t think we’ve really seen any themes where one region is doing any better than the other. I mean, we’ve hit all time property level highs in shop leasing in Boston, Miami, Cleveland, and Portland. And that just means, if the high watermark for a shop rent was $40 a foot. We’ve hit $50 or $55 a foot in Cleveland. We’ve hit $80 in Boston. We’ve hit $80 in Miami. So, I think, shop rents really seem to be growing in the right wealthy sub markets in a lot of the portfolio markets we’re in.
Samir Khanal: Got it. Thank you. Thanks so much.
Operator: And our next question will come from Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. How are you?
David Lukes: Good morning, Alex.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, so 2 questions here. First, David, you’ve laid out clearly a case to be patient in redeploying capital. So presumably that centers around the $190 million of preferred that presumably you guys will get towards the end of this year once RVI completes their transaction in Puerto Rico. So the question about that $190 million is, should we expect your cash balance to just go up by $190 million? Are you going to try to prepay some debt, or if you are going to redeploy this capital? Is it going to be mostly equity based? Or should we think about the $190 million, maybe being more or like $300 million, if you assume issuance of incremental unsecured debt to lever this capital?
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Alex, it’s Conor. It’s a great question. And as David mentioned a minute ago, we’ve got kind of a multitude of options. I think the easiest way to think about it is kind of tying this back to Rich’s question. Our general debt-to-EBITDA range, we target is 5 to 6 times. So if you factor in EBITDA growth, the disposition proceeds we’ve received here today, plus the cash on hand plus $190 million, you probably have an excess or well in excess of $190 million of buying power. To David’s point, it will take time to slow that capital, and we’ll be judicious in how we deploy it. But it’s in excess of $190 million, once you factor in EBITDA growth and kind of our leverage targets. But again, it will take time. So just want to be kind of cautious on that approach.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, to that point, it’s not like you’re going to go out and do stock buybacks with that money, we should expect to just sit on the balance sheet?
Conor Fennerty: We always as you know, we – every dollar that goes out the door, we’re looking at every option, every use. At this point in time, I will tell you, we’re pretty excited about, but the investment opportunities we’re seeing and think it’s the best use of our capital, but that could change. To your point, we’re in a really good spot leverage wise. It doesn’t feel like we want to go lower leverage wise. It really is about deploying capital externally growing enterprise where we feel like we can create stakeholder value. But you’re right, we always look at everything.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And the second question is, you guys did about $15 million on your ATM. Just sort of curious, was that just to make sure that your ATM card worked and you remember the  I mean, or you had some banker desperate to show something to his or her manager that you guys are printing a ticket?
David Lukes: It has more to do with blackout periods, I would say.
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, volume blackout period to David’s point. Look, it’s a facility we have not utilized in the last 4 years we’ve been here. We’re really excited to have another source of capital. And, I think, it speaks to just the investment opportunity we’re seeing and our excitement about a creatively growing the enterprise, where we think as possible. So if the cost of capital is there, Alex, you should assume we’ll hit it. One really exciting part about that that feature, which I know you’re familiar with, as we’ve got a year to draw those proceeds, so if we find more opportunities to hit the ATM and build up that kind of liquidity reserved, and then we’ll take advantage of it. So we’re really excited about it, I know, $14 million doesn’t sound like a lot. But, we’re looking at a range of asset sizes, and maybe it fits nicely for an asset we’re looking at. So that’s how I kind of think about it.
Alexander Goldfarb: Right. But said to your previous answer on the $190 million, it seems odd that you guys would be looking at ATM issuance, if you’re being very picky on the acquisition and you see time taken to put $190 million, so they seem to be conflicting…
David Lukes: Yeah, just remember, Alex, that the Puerto Rico sale wasn’t announced until a few weeks ago.
Conor Fennerty: The only thing, Alex, we could – I mean, I guess to our point, we’ve got a year to deploy that capital. The RVI proceeds potentially could come back this year. So I mean, you’re talking about a little bit longer timeline, I would just say if we think we – our cost of capital, we can creatively invest around it, we’ll take advantage, we’ll build the liquidity reserve. And again, to my point on the ATM, there’s no dilution, so we draw that down. So it’s a great feature that we really like and we can match fund or appropriately are expecting that fund. I would expect that if we like to call it capital, and we like what we’re seeing the investment opportunity or investment opportunity set, we’ll continue to utilize that.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you, Conor.
Conor Fennerty: You’re very welcome.
David Lukes: Thanks, Alex.
Operator: And our next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. I think a couple of quarters ago you talked about leasing TIs remaining elevated for the foreseeable future. But given a return to normalcy sooner, do you expect to spend less on TIs and leasing CapEx going forward?
Conor Fennerty: I was going to say the short answer is no, Linda. We’ve been – you think about our leasing CapEx should increase. 2020 was depressed for a host of reasons, one for activity in second leasing volume. But as we get more tenants open, David referenced 15 more anchors that were in negotiation. As we get them signed and then open, you should expect our leasing CapEx to start to go up. The only nuance just to clarify, I don’t expect cost per foot to go up. But just total CapEx dollars going out the door will increase in the back half of this year and into 2022, especially versus 2020, and probably more comparable to 2019 and 2018 levels as a percentage of NOI.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. That’s helpful. And then in terms of the $11 million signed but not opened, what’s the cadence of that coming online.
Conor Fennerty: Yes, we’ve got a chart in our earnings slide. Linda, I think it’s on Page 9 in the bottom right corner of that slide. It’s pretty back half weighted – or back end weighted, right? So typically, tenants want to open in the spring or the fall. And obviously, we’re through the spring for this year. So it’s really a fourth quarter event for us this year, and then for 2022 and 2023 same thing. What’s interesting is, if you look at this chart, we’ve got deals out till 2023 and 2024. And I think it speaks to David’s point, if a retailer sees an opportunity in some of our markets to get into it, they’re signing leases even though the rents might not commence till 2023 or 2024. So, I think that kind of speaks to the demand we’re seeing and why we’re so excited operationally.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. The final one, in terms of tenants on cash basis, sounds like it was $3 million that got paid back this quarter. Can you remind us what percentage is on cash basis and what’s considered a normal amount of ABR, when you’re – to be on cash basis, when you’re in a steady state?
Conor Fennerty: Yeah. So it’s 12%, as of the end of the quarter, it was 13% at the end of the first quarter. So modestly down, we took a few tenants off of cash basis, I would say kind of normal pre-COVID steady-state levels is zero or close to it. So we’ve got a long way to go. I would just tell you, we’re really excited about the operating environment. We’re really excited about our outlook in next couple of years. But we’re going to be really cautious on a cash basis. And we’ve got to kind of fact pattern that we need to see before we take a tenant off. And for some tenants, like I said, about a percent of our ABR, we saw that in the second quarter. But for others, we need to see a little bit more. So I think it’s something you’ll gradually see wind down over the next, call it, 12 months. But I would tell you, we’re in no hurry, and we need to make sure our kind of fact pattern is met before we make any changes.
Linda Tsai: Great. Thanks.
Conor Fennerty: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks guys for taking my question. Look pretty good, I’m trying to understand, one of the things, obviously, the balance sheet is in much, much better shape now than it was last year or a couple of years prior, Conor, congrats on reducing leverage. I guess, one other thing, which you alluded to, but maybe if you can expand on the term of the debt seems to be pretty short around 4 years. Some of your peers are closer to 8 to 10 years. Have you – do you – how do you planning on extending some of that debt? Or, obviously, some of these bonds don’t come due for 2 or 3 years? Anything you can do in the meantime?
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Floris, it’s a good question. And as you remember, in 2017, when we first started kind of making some changes in the balance sheet, we are hyper focused on duration, and that’s where we focus initially, and remains kind of intense focus of ours. I would not to sound like the middle child, but I would say our lack of issuance on the 30-year front definitely impacts us on the relative comparisons to the peer group. Look, we don’t have an unsecured maturity until 2023. You’re absolutely right. We do have some kind of straggler bonds in 2023 and 2024. So maybe there’s an opportunity for us to clean up some of those. I would just tell you with the amount of liquidity we have, where leverage is today, we feel extremely comfortable with our duration and our debt maturity stack, but you’re right, there are some opportunities for us in the next couple years to even further improve upon that. So, again, if you look at kind of the big unsecured maturities, there really don’t start until 2025, so 4-plus years. But there are some opportunities to further extend that. The only other thing I would add is just, it’s important to look at kind of the unencumbered pools. And to me, that’s probably the most important we talked to our bond investors that they’re extremely focused on that. Unencumbered debt yield is close to 20%. So, I mean, there’s incredible security around our bonds today. And it’s something I felt really good about our positioning and our conversations with the IG community.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, Conor. So maybe on the acquisition side, I noticed also it didn’t get much press, but you bought an asset in Charlottesville, I think, it’s right next to the federal asset there. Maybe if you can talk about the thought process behind buying a relatively small asset in a new market, and your thoughts on that market and also on the growth in that asset?
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, sure. Well, Floris, I mean, given the size of it, you’re right. It doesn’t warrant a whole lot of conversation. We’ve got about 1.5 million square feet in Virginia. We’ve got a lot of leasing presence there. I think, we have always targeted Charlottesville as an interesting area. The corner of Emmet and Barracks is a very, very high traffic intersection, probably one of the highest traffic intersections in the whole submarket. You’re right around the corner from the law school. You’re right, there’s a Kroger and Harris Teeter right across the street. I mean, this particular asset has really high credit. It’s a corporate Verizon store and a couple of shops. So I would say it’s an indicator that we’re willing to aggregate smaller properties that have kind of some durability and some growth and some good credit. And this is one market that we would love to do that. So we’re looking at more properties along this corridor.
Floris van Dijkum: And then last, maybe in terms of other opportunities within your JV. Would you consider buying out some of your JV stakes in some of your properties as cap rates for other assets have gotten really lower? And, obviously, these assets well – are these things less growthy, and you were more interested in pursuing things such as the Charlottesville or the Florida transaction you did recently.
David Lukes: Yeah, I think one of the benefits of the JV program is that you’ve always got inventory that you’re very familiar with, right? So it does make it natural for us to always be looking at potential JV dispositions. And, again, I think we’ll be very careful. Some of them might be good assets, but a little flat. Some of them might be great assets with some growth. And, I think, you’re right, we would see that as an opportunity. But it really depends on when our partner wants to sell.
Conor Fennerty: Yeah, Floris, coming back to, I guess, tying that into Todd’s question, but one kind of material change in our JV pipeline is these assets generally consistent of what we own today. So they’re more consistent with what we own today. To David’s point, there’s a variety of growth profiles. But you’re right, it could be opportunity. The only thing, I would just clarify is, our partners are extremely sophisticated, and we’re really excited to have them as partners, there is no discount, per se from buying from a JV partner you’re buying at market. So that’s the only clarification I would make on that.
Floris van Dijkum: Do you typically have a right of first offer or right the first bid on those assets?
David Lukes: You typically have some way to accept the real estate if you want it. To be perfectly honest, in my experience, whatever the legal contracts, say, if a partner wants to sell your operating partner is the most natural and logical buyer, especially one that doesn’t need mortgage debt to make it happen. You don’t have to hire a broker, I mean, there’s a lot of benefits. But again, to Conor’s point, our partners are sophisticated investors, they know when they want to sell, they have a view on pricing. And so to a certain extent, we wait for them to make a decision and then we can start some dialogue. We’ve done in the past when we bought some assets, as you know, from Blackstone last year. We bought assets from JV partners in the past. It’s a pretty common theme, and it is nice to have inventory that you’re familiar with.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, guys.
Conor Fennerty: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Just a quick one, I’m curious for the 2021 FFO guidance, are there any other prior period when collections anticipated in the second quarter that are baked into guidance?
Conor Fennerty: No, they’re not, Mike.
Michael Mueller: Okay. That’s all I had.
Conor Fennerty: But the only comment I’d make there, I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We’re not running out of reversals per se, but there’s definitely a smaller amount, right? So our cash basis deferral pipeline is down to $3 million. And you can see from more slides, our deferrals really are spread out a little bit more now between 2021 and 2022, just because the 2021 deferrals has entirely been repaid. So that kind of impact from reversals, you’ll see in the third and fourth quarter, in theory should reverse if we kind of see – or it should mitigate versus the second quarter. And it’s simply because we’re running out of kind of cash basis deferrals to impact numbers.
Michael Mueller: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. Appreciate it. Thanks.
Conor Fennerty: Yeah.
Operator: And our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Conor, this may be following up on Mike’s questions as it relates to some of the feature of potential upside in the second quarter. What was the impact of your move from cash basis to accrual basis on the second quarter results?
Conor Fennerty: It was a couple of $100,000 a straight line rent, Chris, so I would call it immaterial.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then as it relates to your updated guidance, is there any additional sort of accrual – cash to accrual upside included in that guidance?
Conor Fennerty: No, there’s not. There’s no assumption per se that will put more people on or take more people off cash basis.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then my last question for you is it relates to your sort of your thoughts about debt duration. I think your predecessor thought about preferred being sort of a very long duration debt instrument. How do you think about preferred stock in your calculation of duration?
Conor Fennerty: I would say, we think about it quite a bit or talk about it quite a bit. For us, it really depends on our cost of capital, right? And you remember in 2018, we used – 2019, excuse me, we used equity to take out press in 2021, we used equity to take out press. So I would say there’s a point in time and there’s periods of time, where preferred makes sense in your capital structure. And it depends almost entirely on your cost of equity and your cost of debt. So if our cost of equity is attractive, maybe we use it as an opportunity to take out press. The nice part is, Chris, as you know, we’ve got until June of next year to make that decision or to think about it. But I think there’s a point in every year and place in every capital structure for preferred, it’s just the question of how big you want it relative to the enterprise? And what are the other kind of costs of debt and equity. So I would just say we’re in no hurry to make that trade again, but if the prices there, then we consider it. So I would say that’s kind of our way of thinking about it. But, I do think it’s consistent with what – as you said, my predecessors thought about it and how we think about it going forward.
Christopher Lucas: Okay, thanks. And then, David, for you, when I think about sort of the whole leasing cycle from the retailer’s perspective to the competition for leasing to getting leases signed, with your conversations that you’re having with your national retail clients. What are you seeing in terms of their demand right now for open to buyers, which would be essentially for rent commencements that would be in 2023 and 2024? How does it compare to sort of 2018 and 2019 in terms of the demand level?
David Lukes: Well, I mean, it’s uncomfortable to say that they’re higher. And I know that that’s somewhat shocking, given where we are in COVID and what happened last year. But there’s probably the biggest change we’ve seen is that there are new concepts. I mean, we can name 100,000 square feet that we’re going to sign in the next quarter that is tenants that didn’t exist a year ago, and they’re credit tenants. So I think what you’re really seeing is a lot of the high credit brands have come up with sub-brands. And they’re starting to roll out those sub-brands with the parent guarantee. And when they have kind of an open to buy, they’re picking the wealthiest zip codes in the country, and they want to do portfolio reviews. And they want to do multiple brands on the same site, that’s new for us. I mean, that has not been the case for a while. If you remember, 3 or 4 years ago, there was a cycle where a lot of the old line retailers were filing and liquidating. And now, it seems to be the opposite, where the survivors are coming up with new brands and they’re starting to roll out new concepts. So that has been a big piece of it. The other theme I think that’s interesting is the shop leasing is significantly better than 3 years ago, even 2 years ago. There is just more national credit demand for shop space. Two years ago, Chris, we maybe had one or two tenants that were right-sized to backfill a Pier 1. Now, there’s a half a dozen to a dozen tenants that are strategically sized to fit that type of unit. So it just feels like there is a lot of examples of retailers that are growing right now. And it does feel like the open to buy is much better than it was 2 years ago.
Christopher Lucas: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Tammi Fique: Thank you. Good morning. I am just wondering, I’m sorry if I missed this. But in the presentation, you mentioned that 13 of 20 anchor deals are with investment grade or net cash entities. And, I guess, I’m just curious what the credit looks like on the remaining anchor deals that you are doing.
Conor Fennerty: I think, Tammi, to David’s comment, there’s, I would say, more depth in demand from anchors today than kind of ever before. So you should assume if we’re not doing an IG or a net cash entity, it doesn’t mean they’re in a materially worse balance sheet position, they might just not be IG or they might not be public or they might have some debt. But to David’s point, there is a real depth in demand. And so, we are making sure if we’re investing capital in an anchor today, which is significant, we’re doing it with the right anchor that we believe in their business plan and their balance sheet over a longer period, well in excess of just our initial 10-year term. So it’s not to criticize the other 7. It’s more just to speak to the quality. I mean, you’ve heard us talk about multiple times, 37 of our top 50 are public, 64 of our top 100 are public. I mean that matters to us. And you’ve seen that in our collections and our reversals this quarter. And it’s a huge focus of ours as we invest capital in the tenant.
Tammi Fique: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, maybe just one more. It’s obviously been a busy time in the sector in terms of M&A and I think you’ve talked pretty extensively today about accretively growing the enterprise. But I guess I’m just wondering if, I guess, one, that acquisitions are a part of the long-term plan for SITE Centers. And if that is in any way driven by benefits of size and scale in the sector. And maybe asked another way, just do you think bigger is better in this space?
David Lukes: Well, let’s take that in 2 parts, Tammi. There is no question that when we’re in the position we are, which is a good amount of retained earnings, we’ve got some asset sales here and there. We’ve got the preferred coming back. We do want to be in an acquisitive stance. We will be focusing a lot on external growth. And the more we grow, it is true that it does leverage your G&A. And so, it is beneficial to be growing the company. But I don’t necessarily think that needs to result in M&A activity. A lot of times it’s easier to grow a succinct portfolio that you know all the pieces. And so, from that perspective, I think having 80 wholly-owned assets, and kind of being very careful about deploying and growing that core portfolio, along with operating the assets that we know, it feels like we’re at a pretty good size right now to grow methodically. And I don’t think we have to worry about super-sizing or super-scaling.
Tammi Fique: Okay, great. Thanks for your thoughts.
David Lukes: Thanks, Tammi.
Operator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all for joining our call. We’ll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time."
53,SITC,3,2021,2021-10-25 12:52:07,"Operator: Good morning and welcome to the SITE Center reports Third Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Stephen Bakke: Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to SITE Centers’ third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and slide presentation on our website at www.sitecenters.com, which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today’s call. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and in our filings with the SEC including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO, operating FFO and same store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today’s quarterly financial supplement. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Steve. Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had another strong quarter really across the board. OFFO was ahead of plan. New leasing volume was at its highest in a number of years. We exceeded our 2021 investment goals with the closing of Hammond Springs and subsequent to quarter end RVI distributed $190 million to SITE Centers. Thank you to the entire SITE Centers team for working so hard to achieve these accomplishments, which position our company for sustainable growth going forward. I'll start this morning discussing third quarter results, talk briefly about leasing and then discuss our investments and capital as we look to grow our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. As I mentioned, third quarter OFFO was ahead of our budget and higher-than-expected NOI and lower G&A expense. We collected 99% of our build rent for the quarter. Looking back to 2020, we've now collected 96% of 2020 base rent, including $21 million of deferral repayments. Our tenant assistance program, which effectively ended in 2020 has now collected 98% of the deferred rent due, which is really a testament to the durability of our portfolio cash flow, the credit strength of our tenant base, and the quality of our team and our real estate. Moving to leasing, we had a truly outstanding quarter with over 1 million square feet leased, including 237,000 square feet of new leasing, which is our highest in 2 years, despite having a considerably smaller portfolio. We signed 6 anchors this past quarter, bringing our year-to-date anchors to 19. These 19 anchors signed year-to-date have a number of interesting characteristics that are indicative of the operational strength we're seeing. First off, 15 of the 19 anchors were signed with publicly traded companies highlighting the credit quality of our primarily national portfolio. Second, 30% of the square footage is from new concepts that are sponsored by investment grade parent companies, and were launched in the last 18 months. We have 13 more anchors in lease negotiation, which we expect to be completed by the first quarter of next year with similar characteristics to the deal signed to date. We expect this activity to be a material driver of our growth over the next several years, particularly since new anchors that have property usually drive shop demand in response. We've already seen some of this demand result in positive rental growth and an acceleration in executed shop leases, including over 50 new shop deals in this quarter alone with a number of exciting and well capitalized new concepts. Shifting to investments. In September, we acquired Hammond Springs in Atlanta for $31 million, which pushes our year-to-date acquisitions to $80 million ahead of our $75 million goal for 2021. Atlanta is our largest market and we're very excited about the growth outlook for the city and for this property in particular with average household incomes in excess of $130,000 and incredible visibility in a high traffic corridor. Similar to Delray and Charlottesville acquisitions, convenience is the anchor of this site as it does not have a traditional large format tenant. While box demand has been very strong, the advancements in geo location data mean that we don't have to rely on the anchor as the assumed primary driver of traffic. This opens a compelling subsector in open air shopping center and has been the bulk of our acquisitions year-to-date. That said, going forward, I'd expect us to be active in both anchored and unanchored assets that fit our growth and submarket criteria. Our investment thesis is based on three clear facts that have emerged in the last year and a half. One, there is now more money in wealthy suburbs; two, there are more frequent customer visits due to more flexible work-from-home culture; and three, an increasing value and convenience from both tenants and customers alike. These facts are producing occupancy gains, but also rent growth. At a time when buying vacancy is becoming increasingly challenging, given the strength of operating fundamentals, we are heavily focused on finding the right properties in the right submarkets where rent growth is happening and we have an opportunity to re-tenant existing square footage with stronger credit tenants at higher rents. The foundation of our investments is our balance sheet and our access to capital. As was announced a few weeks ago, RVI declared and paid a distribution on Site's preferred investment in early October. In this distribution SITE Centers received $190 million and does not expect to receive any additional distributions from RVI in the future on the account of its preferred investment. The payment along with recently announced RVI asset sales and a common dividend declaration leaves RVI with just three remaining properties and a clear path towards the conclusion. It also returns almost $700 million of capital to preferred and common stakeholders, which was part of the original thesis and the business plan for the formation of RVI. All of us at SITE Centers are incredibly proud of the thought and work that went into this innovative spin, and we are excited about future investment prospects for the return capital we received. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, David. I'll comment first on quarterly results, discuss revisions to 2021 guidance and forward earnings considerations and conclude with our balance sheet. Third quarter results were ahead of plan as David mentioned on better operations and lower G&A expense. Total uncollectible revenue at SITE share included $1.6 million of income, or $0.01 per share from payments related to prior periods, primarily from cash basis tenants. Outside of this, there were no other material one-time items that impacted the quarter. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was up 50 basis points sequentially, which is on top of 40 basis points last quarter, and speaks to the strength of our leasing activity and minimal bankruptcies. Based on our current leasing pipeline that David outlined, we believe the lease rate will continue to increase into year-end. We provided an updated schedule on the expected ramp of our $12 million signed, but not open pipeline on Page 8 of our earnings slides. We had 300,000 square feet or $5.1 million of annualized base rent commencements in the third quarter, and the SNO pipeline now represents just over 3% of annualized third quarter base rent or over 4% if you also include the anchors in negotiation in our pipeline. Moving on to our outlook. We're increasing 2021 OFFO guidance to a range of $1.13 to $1.14 per share to incorporate reported results with outperformance driven by prior period reversals, earlier rent commencements and higher retention. Rent commencements and uncollectible revenue remain the most volatile factors which will impact fourth quarter results. We've also increased same-store NOI guidance to a range of 12.5% to 14%. The updated range reflects reported results and excludes any future prior period adjustments. It implies that 2021 same-store NOI is effectively running slightly ahead of 2019 levels, and that 2022 NOI for comparable assets would also be ahead of 2019 based on our leasing pipeline and initial budget forecasts as well. In terms of the fourth quarter, there are a few moving pieces to consider from the third quarter as outlined on Page 12 of our earnings slides. First, as I previously mentioned, we had $1.6 million of nonrecurring uncollectible revenue in the third quarter. Second, we are anticipating a handful of JV asset sales to close in the fourth quarter, which will impact our share of JV NOI and JV fees. Third, we expect RVI fees to be about $3.5 million in the fourth quarter, which is roughly flat from the third quarter. And fourth, G&A will increase from the year-to-date run rate as expenses pick up. These factors will all act as headwinds versus third quarter, partially offset by rent commencements and investment activity. A summary of these factors is on Page 10 of earnings slides. Moving to 2022 OFFO. We are not providing formal guidance at this time, but wanted to provide clarity on a few line items. First on RVI. Given that RVI now owns just three properties, it is fair to assume that RVI fees paid to site will be minimal in 2022 upon the fees resetting in January with the dilution from loss fees offset over time by the reinvestment of preferred proceeds into acquisitions. Second, interest expense at SITE share is expected to be roughly flat to 2021. And third, we would expect G&A to total around $52 million. And fourth, included in 2021 year-to-date results are $12.7 million or $0.06 per share of nonrecurring reserve reversals related to prior periods. Turning to our balance sheet. Including the receivables line item at quarter end, it's just under $2 million of net COVID related deferrals we expect to collect in the future as the deferral program winds down. Details on the timing and composition of the gross deferral balance are outlined on Pages 6, and 7 of our earnings slide deck. But with 84% of the total gross deferral balance repaid to date, the impact on earnings and future periods will be limited. Finally, wrapping up with liquidity and sources and uses, pro forma for the $190 million distribution from RVI and the early retirement of our $88 million January 2022 mortgage maturity, the company has just over $150 million of cash on hand and $25 million of common equity from forward sales under our ATM which is available for future settlement. This liquidity will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise and to drive sustainable OFFO growth and creates stakeholder value. And with that, I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Q - Richard Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to just maybe start with a nuts and bolts question. I appreciate the disclosure about the $12.7 million benefit in '21 to date. Can you maybe walk through how much of that $12.7 million was realized in 3Q? And maybe what we can expect in 4Q?
Conor Fennerty: Sure. It's -- of the $12.7 million, $1.6 million was in the third quarter. We don't budget -- or included in our budget, excuse me, any future revisions. So if we had them in the fourth quarter, that $12.7 million, we move higher.
Richard Hill: Got it. And so just -- so since we don't know last year, exactly, what would same-store NOI had been without that benefit?
Conor Fennerty: Sure. So year-to-date -- and again, that's just for the first three quarters because nothing in the fourth quarter like I mentioned. It's about a 535 -- excuse me, 530 basis point kind of good guide for the year. So all 12.7, Rich, is included in same-store.
Richard Hill: Got it. Thank you very much. And then maybe a bigger picture question about the cadence of occupancy. If I go back to sort of your peak prior to COVID, not in 2019, but even prior to that, you were around 95%. Do you see a path to getting back to 95%, and what does that cadence look like?
David Lukes: Well, I mean, Rich, its David. Based on the past couple of quarters, I think the cadence looks pretty good. And from a portfolio perspective, the quality of the assets, given the spinoff of RVI is a lot higher than it was in the last cycle. So I don't see any reason why the portfolio can't be 95%, 96%.
Conor Fennerty: And, Rich, the only thing to add to that, if you recall, prior to COVID, we had a couple properties and I guess, it's 3 or 4. We were keeping space offline as we looked at some redevelopment properties or projects, excuse me and some other ideas. And our comments kind of over the last couple quarters have been the retail demand has been so strong. The demand from retail tenants has been so strong, we've taken those kind of out of redevelopment and assumed that they will be leased up. So I would say our kind of peak occupancy we think we could do for this portfolio post-COVID is probably higher than it was pre-COVID.
Richard Hill: Okay, that's helpful, guys. And just to maybe push on this a little bit. Is it -- you added almost 50 basis points of sequential improvement on our numbers. Do you think that's a fair runway or should we see acceleration in that sequential improvement?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Rich, the hard part is percentage is always difficult. But if you look on the SNL pipeline that we have in the -- excuse me in the slides, you can kind of you see the dollar amounts we expect. The percentages always can get a little screwy with -- depending on GLA, but I would focus more on the dollars.
Richard Hill: Okay, got it. I'm going to jump back in the queue. I'm sure I have a lot more questions, but I'll give some people some airtime. Thanks, guys.
David Lukes: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katy McConnell from Citi. Please go ahead. Hello, Katy. Is your line open?
Katy McConnell: Hi, good morning. Sorry about that. I was wondering if you could just walk us through the increase that you saw on leasing CapEx per square foot this quarter. And to what extent was that driven by rising construction costs versus the mix of more anchor deals this quarter?
Conor Fennerty: Hi, Katy. It's Conor. So if you look on Page 14, our net effective rents slide on the right side, you can kind of see what percentage the deals are new deals, we're doing are anchors versus shops. And the reason we disclose this is just anchors have lower net effective rents by definition. So if you look on for the fourth quarter, we are assuming for the third quarter, we were up to 57% were anchors. Last quarter, it's only 34%. So I'll turn it over to David for the construction cost comment. But it really is just a mix issue as we just more anchors this quarter. And I’d expect that to continue in the fourth quarter as well.
David Lukes: Yes, on the construction side, Katy, there's no question that there's been some inflation, particularly in construction materials. We haven't really seen it yet in labor, but on the construction material side, there's definitely been a 10% to 15% increase in a number of categories. The issue is when you start to lump in those categories that have inflation, and you look at it as a part of the total cost of the deal, meaning landlord costs, TI and commissions, there hasn't really been that much impact yet that is meaningful. The big issue for us is really more the characterization of whether they’re shops versus anchors.
Katy McConnell: Okay, thanks. And then as you look at the near-term lease expiration schedule, what are your expectations for recapturing space at this point and potential mark-to-market upside next year?
David Lukes: Yes. Well, I think the biggest issue for us is that the leasing demand is so strong, pretty much across the board. I mean, if you remember a year and a half ago, it started in the outparcels and then it moved into anchors, and now it's moving into shops. I think what's really going to happen is we're going to start seeing a lot of properties move to a pretty high occupancy, which is going to put pressure on renewals from tenants because they won't have the choice to relocate. So our expectation is that renewals increase and the percentage of tenants that exercise their options increase, which means that the amount of available inventory we're going to have is going to stay a little bit low.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Katy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. So let me just continue on for Katy's question on leasing CapEx. Taken from a different angle, what are you guys seeing as far as labor and also delays in openings? Some of our recent site visits have shown some restaurants closing early because they don't have the labor, or some I think it's probably more on the F&B side. It's just tougher to open because of equipment shortages, or materials, or millwork and things like that. So curious what you guys are seeing?
David Lukes: Yes, I think, Alex, we're seeing the same thing. I mean, there's growing anecdotal evidence that supply chain problems are starting to have an impact on both costs and timing of construction projects. Today, there really hasn't been any economic impacts to us. And as we're signing leases, I think we're starting to see a little bit longer lead time for signature of lease to rent commencement. And so I think the landlords have had a chance to put that in their budgets, because we're seeing it when we sign the lease. But there's no question that it's been a little more difficult to get permits, it's been harder to get materials, even if you stockpile certain materials and certain pieces of equipment, it's still just a little bit more difficult to get a tenant open. And it costs a little bit more than it has. I wouldn't say it's material yet, but we're certainly keeping our eye on it.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then next question, as you guys look, I mean, you guys just spoken about market rent growth. I think, David, in the past, you mentioned that finally, you're seeing actual market rent growth certainly 18% on new leases is impressive. But if you drill it down, would you say this is widespread across all tenants, all categories? Or is it really driven by certain parts of your portfolio? And then the flip question, what part to your portfolio are you still looking at rent roll downs?
David Lukes: Well, they -- I think the easiest answer to that question is that, as of this quarter, I'm feeling very confident that rent growth is pretty much across the country. I mean, we've hit a high watermark in a number of states with respect to shop rents. I think you're starting to see anchor rents pick up. Anecdotally, a property just came for sale last week across the street from one of our larger assets and the in place rents at that property for sale are in the mid 30s, we just signed four leases in the mid 50s, across the street. So, I think when you kind of turn to acquisitions, it's the same philosophy of finding value and looking for rent growth, because it feels like a lot of rents are really moving up a little bit faster than I would have expected. In terms of mark-to-market, that's always a tough question, Alex, because it has everything to do with when a tenant decides not to exercise their option, or whether decide to exercise. And it is very common when a large portfolio like this to have one or two roll downs every quarter or every other quarter, because you're trying to figure out which tenants you want to keep it long-term. But as you start to see occupancies get up to the fact that these tenants aren't going to find a place to go within the same trade area, then the renewal rates are probably going to increase from here, and I think we'll probably have fewer roll downs.
Alexander Goldfarb: So bottom line, I mean, I know you wouldn't admit like, hey, we have, trouble on 5,000 square foot tenant or trouble on X tenant or whatever. But bottom line is, as we head into next year, you're saying that either because of replacement demand, or just where rents have grown for that size box and that type of tenant, that there's no real area in your portfolio where you expect a material headwind. You look at everything as basically flat up as we head into '22.
David Lukes: That's correct.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, just appreciate some of the earnings considerations for '22. Curious if you could provide some guideposts around investments. You talked about you’ve exceeded the $75 million target for '21. You were repaid the $190 million RVI pref. Just curious if you can talk about the timeline to reinvest that capital and what we might expect as we look ahead into '22?
David Lukes: Sure, Todd. Well, if you remember, when we set our goal for this year, we had leverage levels, we had some free cash flow. And I think we achieved those goals this quarter kind of barely moving past what our original budget for the year was. The difference, of course, as you know, is that now we have the repayment of the RVI press. So the cash on hand is about $150 million, as Conor mentioned. And I would expect that we're going to be reinvesting that capital as soon as we find assets that we think fit well with the portfolio. So I think it's fair to assume that that's kind of our target at this point, to deploy that $150 million. Beyond that, I think it has everything to do with the opportunities because our leverage right now is at the low end of our kind of preferred debt to EBITDA range. So I think we do have a lot of capacity to grow if we find things that we want, but we're going to start with the cash on hand and then move from there.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then I just had a follow-up, I guess, on your comments around rent growth. There has been a considerable increase in retail sales across most categories. And I'm just curious, if you see anything changing regarding the -- sort of model around setting rents and occupancy costs that retailers can tolerate, whether you'd expect to sort of participate in the higher sales environment as leases expire, as you would ordinarily or are there other implications today that sort of might prevent you from seeing the flow through as you negotiate new and renewal rents?
Conor Fennerty: No, I think, Todd, just come back to David's answer, I think you're spot on. I mean, you look at the factors that are driving rent growth, tenant sales are a big part of it, right. And so I think we would agree with you that as tenant sales continue to improve and are well above COVID levels, like our top 15 tenants, I think like 13 to 15 has sales for their portfolios above 2019 levels. That inures to our benefit as we renew them or as they look to sign new leases. So I think the longer -- the short answer to your question is, yes, we do expect to participate in the sales growth in the form of either higher renewals or higher new leases, as we execute them over the next couple years.
Todd Thomas: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samir Khanal from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Hi, David. Can you provide a little bit more detail on the property you acquired in Atlanta, Georgia? What was the cap rate on the deal? Maybe broadly, what are you seeing for pricing for centers that are anchored and unanchored centers at this time?
David Lukes: Yes. Hi, good morning, Samir. We haven't disclosed cap rates on individual properties. I think the way I'd like to describe it is that when you're in a rent growth market, it's a lot different deploying capital than when you're in an occupancy growth market from an acquisitions perspective. It's very difficult to find vacancy to buy right now, because sellers don't want to sell vacancy. The operating fundamentals are just too good. So what we try and do is, is use all of our evidence from recent leasing to figure out where market rents are going, which tenants have demand, how we can fill that -- fulfill that demand. And in this particular property in Hammond Springs, it was an asset we've been chasing for the last couple of years. Same with Delray, we've been really after the sellers to see if we could acquire them. And it's just very, very high traffic intersection. It's got the near-term rollovers from shop tenants with no options, which gives us a mark-to-market that's double digits. So we're very excited about the CAGR on this one more than anything else. To a certain extent, that does show up in the cap rates. And so I think what's really happening on both anchored and unanchored, and frankly, of many types of format, whether it's grocery or power, or a mixture of both or lifestyle, you're starting to see the unlevered IRR. It's all kind of move down together, because the risk of occupancy and finding tenants has been replaced by the opportunity to raise the rents on existing tenants. So I think for the next year or two, it feels like this business is going to be a renewals business. And that endures very well to a company that's buying assets with leases that have near-term rollover.
Samir Khanal: Got it. Thanks for that color. And maybe second for me is on the occupancy side for the shop space. I mean, how long do you think it'll take you to get you to -- take you to get back to the sort of 90% level for shop space, which I think is sort of pre-COVID level?
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Samir, we haven't put out kind of our multiyear target yet. It's something we're working on now. But I think just to come back to David's initial comments, we're starting to see a lot more momentum on that front. So I do think you'll start to move up -- shops move up in sympathy with our anchors, but we haven't put out kind of long-term target. I do think coming back to Rich's question now, it is fair to assume at the very least we get back to where we were pre-COVID levels. The only difference versus the anchors is unlike the 3 or 4 properties I mentioned, where we were keeping anchor space offline. We weren't keeping shops offline. So that would be the only difference, but otherwise I think it's fair to assume shops move up in sympathy with our anchors, we just haven't given that long-term target yet.
Samir Khanal: That's it for me. Thanks, guys.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Samir.
Operator: The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Good morning, guys. Question. Obviously, saw the quarter, very strong balance sheets. Congrats, Conor on that. As you think out, how do you expect to be deploying your, call a $1.2 billion of liquidity potentially and as you think about acquisitions versus redevelopments versus ground up developments versus M&A, how would you rank those potential capital usages?
Conor Fennerty: Good morning, Floris. On a risk adjusted basis, there's no question that the primary target right now is external acquisitions.
Floris van Dijkum: And so if you're looking at external acquisitions, you're talking about how your IRRs are becoming -- are coming in a little bit because obviously pricing has gone up. At what point does that flip and I know your redevelopment pipeline seems pretty light right now and I think that's by choice. Do you see that changing anytime or what needs to happen on the acquisition side? How much more do unlevered IRRs need to come in before that starts to flip to where you think hey, I deploy more capital in redevelopment.
David Lukes: Yes. What's interesting is that I'm not personally convinced that the unlevered IRRs have come in that substantially. I think the difference is the going-in cap rates have come down. But rent growth is becoming to show its -- rear its head pretty, pretty robustly I think across a lot of companies. So if your going-in cap rate is lower, but your growth is higher and there's less CapEx because it's more renewals and less occupancy driven, I think you're sustaining on unlevered IRR that's the same it was 6 or 9 months ago. So I mean, to me, I think that's why external acquisitions right now has the highest unlevered IRR at the lowest risk, because it's becoming more of a renewals business and less of an occupancy or development business. And let's not forget that the challenge with redevelopment is the time factor, where it's a long time to entitle, it's a long time to permit. There is good NAV growth on a redevelopment pipeline, but it's not without risks particularly with construction costs going up. And I think that's why a lot of retailers are starting to focus on grabbing whatever square footage they can in wealthy submarkets, because they know there's going to be a lag before new construction shows up.
Conor Fennerty: And unfortunately, only clarification just on the redevelopment side, we've got disclosed here it on Page 17 of our sub just the projects underway. We've got a number of other tactical projects, we're working on pads, out lots, et cetera. Some small scale expansions, but they just don't show up in our sup  until they're underway. So we've got a couple more that we're excited about and working on. It's not like we're shelving them to focus on acquisitions. But you're right relative to the enterprise, acquisitions would be more material relative to redevelopment.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks, guys. That's it for me.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, Floris.
Operator:  The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, good morning. In terms of your interest in non-anchor centers, you mentioned you have two locational data to get comfort with demand. What do you look for from a credit or merchandise mix perspective to be comfortable around the sustainability of that traffic since there isn't an anchor?
David Lukes: Yes. I think the -- it's a great question, Linda. I mean, if you start with the data that tells you who the customers are, that's the most important piece, or at least the first step, are you attracting the customers, are they coming to the property to transact. And the second is the credit profile. And I think it's -- it would be somewhat surprising if you were to look at a lot of unanchored product in the U.S., it does have a lot of credit tenants, particularly on the banking side, wealth management, a lot of restaurant concepts and so forth. So the credit profile, I don't think is all that dissimilar to any other traditional anchored center. And what we look for is kind of the right mix between the credit tenants, which usually have a number of options left. And therefore they really have your real estate for a number of years versus the local tenants that usually don't have options, and therefore there's more near-term expiration. So the game plan for quite a bit of this unanchored strip that we've been purchasing is to measure the credit quality of the tenants that are there, recognize that they're likely to be staying based on traffic, and then look for specific renewal or replacement ideas for some of the local tenants, so we can upgrade the credit quality along the way.
Linda Tsai: Makes sense. And then how are you thinking about bad debt for 2022 since 2021 benefited from portfolio  bankruptcies and 20 consumer strength, improving credit profiles, government support?
David Lukes: Yes, it's a good question, Linda. We haven't given any guidance on bad debt or uncollectible revenue, whichever bucket you kind to look at. I would just say, in terms of bankruptcies, there's nothing material we're tracking today that could quickly change, obviously, the holiday season approaching. And again, I mean, as we talked about over the last couple of quarters since COVID started, if you look at our top tenants and the number who are public and how much capital they've accessed, they've materially changed their balance sheets from a capital structure perspective. And then coming back to I think it was Todd's question on the sales side, the sales have increased as well. So I would just say from a tenant credit perspective, we feel materially better about our tenants today than we did pre-COVID with maybe an exception or two around theaters, et cetera. But we'll see how the holiday shakes up and plays out and we will provide guidance in February as kind of explicit numbers for next year.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. Just one last one. You mentioned retention rates helping the quarter. What was -- what's the progression been like the past few quarters? And how does 3Q compare to the historical average?
Conor Fennerty: Well, the progression has been an easy ride. If you think about 2020 and COVID, obviously with the number of bankruptcies et cetera, and fallout, it was it was lower. I don't have the exact figure offhand Linda. But historically we've seen anchors in the 90% and shops in that 70%, 80%. And so to David's point, if that climbs higher, you're going to see a higher retention rate and probably more pressure -- upward pressure, excuse me on rents on both anchors and shops. So again, I think for anchors it's been historically in that 90% area and for shops in the 70%, 80% area.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Mueller: Yes. Hi. Two questions. First, David, can you talk a little bit about some of the new concepts that you're doing deals with that you mentioned in your intro comments. And then on when you're evaluating anchor versus unanchored shopping center acquisitions, I mean, what are the differences you're generally seeing in terms of escalators, embedded organic growth differences between the two?
David Lukes: Sure. Well, on the concept side, I mean, there's been a couple of concepts that are sponsored by major credit investment grade corporations. Think Public Lands, which is a new concept that Dick's Sporting Goods has. It's a really interesting concept. I think it fits well with kind of this post-COVID outdoors activity-centric culture. I think they've got a great runway ahead of them. It's a really, really cool concept. Dollar General started a unit called Popshelf, which we've been working with quite a bit. I think it's a fascinating concept that fits right in that size of box that Pier 1 left a couple of years ago. It's -- I think it's kind of a wealthier suburban oriented concept around 9,000 to 10,000 square feet, really cool concept. Bunch of restaurants, Cava and Sweetgreen and the like, really interesting and kind of adding something new to a lot of properties. Even if you look, Mike, it's some of the capital raises lately or IPO filings. You've got First Watch and Portillo's and Allbirds, you are starting to see some of these online retailers move into bricks and mortar. So that the new concepts, I think have been one of the surprises for us in the last 6 months, where there really have been a lot of tenants focused heavily on bricks and mortar. When you translate that to acquisitions and anchored versus unanchored, I mean, part of the reason in my prepared remarks I said that we'd be looking at both types of assets is that I think it just has to do with the opportunity of an individual property and renewals right now really is where we're angling for because that's where the rent growth is at, and that's where you can capture more IRR. I haven't really seen a big difference in escalators, frankly, with shop leases, whether it's an anchored or unanchored property and the escalators are always similar somewhere in the kind of 2.5% to 3.5% range. What's more important is which tenants have options and which ones don't because the higher occupancy gets, as I’ve said, the more likely tenants are going to be forced to trigger their options, which means there -- then is even less inventory for others. So I think that's kind of the way we're looking at it, Mike.
Michael Mueller: Great. That was it. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all very much for attending. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Monica Kukreja: Thank you Operator. Good morning and welcome to SITE Centers’ fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes, and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fenerty. In addition to the press release issued this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and slide presentation on our website at www.sitecenters.com which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today’s call.  Please be aware that certain of our statements today may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.

At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you Monica. Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Quarterly results and investment activity capped what turned out to be a fantastic year for SITE Centers. OFFO was ahead of plan really on all line items, and new leasing volume was the highest in four years. We utilized a portion of the $190 million distribution from RVI to acquire $143 million of real estate, beginning the transformation from RVI fees to property cash flow, and we repaid mortgage debt ahead of maturity.  Our balance sheet remains in great shape with debt to EBITDA in the low 5s at year-end. Thank you to the entire SITE Centers team for working so hard to get so much done in one quarter to position the company for growth in 2022 and onward. I’ll start this morning discussing fourth quarter results, talk briefly about leasing and tenant demand, and then discuss our investments in capital allocation as we look to grow our portfolio of assets in wealth suburban communities. As I mentioned, fourth quarter OFFO was ahead of our budget on better operations, which Conor will provide more details on later. We collected 99% of our build rent for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021 and are effectively back to pre-pandemic collection levels. Our tenant assistance program is essentially complete as well, which speaks to our credit quality and is a reflection of the fact that almost 90% of our base rent is from national tenants. Moving to leasing, tenants are paying more to get into properties in the last mile of wealthy suburban zip codes and renewing leases at a higher rate than pre-pandemic levels. We had our highest level of new leasing in four years despite having a considerably more focused portfolio and signed more shop square footage in the quarter than as far back as the company has been tracking retailers as they expand their store fleets.  Over the course of the year, we signed 900,000 square feet of new leases, increasing our leased rate by 110 basis points. More importantly, we signed deals with well-capitalized national credit tenants with 85% of our anchors signed with publicly traded companies and 22% of the square footage signed from new concepts that were launched in the last 18 months and are sponsored by investment-grade parent companies. Almost 10% of the new leasing activity by base rent was with grocers and another 23% was with first-to-portfolio tenants. Looking forward, we have a half million square feet at share in lease negotiations which we expect to be completed in the next six months with similar characteristics to the deals we signed in 2021. We expect the leases recently signed, along with the current activity, to be a material driver of our growth over the next several years. Shifting to investments, we had a very active fourth quarter buying out partner interests in joint ventures in Arizona and Florida, acquiring peripheral land in Charlotte and Princeton, and adding another convenience property in Charlottesville. I’ll start with our Florida portfolio acquisition. We acquired five public anchored properties from our partner in key markets for us, like Tampa and Miami. The grocers generate on average almost $800 per square foot in sales, and the properties at year end were 87% leased, offering a mix of leasing and tactical redevelopment upside with a five-year underwritten NOI CAGR north of 5%. We have activity on every one of the vacant anchors in this portfolio and are seeing strong momentum on the shops as well. Pro forma for this acquisition, Florida is now our largest state by base rent with just under 20% of the company’s ABR and growing.  In Phoenix, we bought out another partner in a property with average household incomes above $130,000 yet with occupancy rate of just 56%. We have activity on the vast majority of the vacant square footage with an exciting mix of new retailers and expect to double the property’s NOI over the next five years. For the year, we invested $223 million in assets, including four convenience properties with an underwritten five-year NOI CAGR over 5% and a blended cap rate of just under 6%. Each of these properties, all located in key markets for the company, including Delray Beach, Scottsdale, Atlanta, and Princeton, will be drivers of the company’s future growth.  Shifting to investments, I’d expect us to be active in both anchored and unanchored assets that fit our growth and our sub-market criteria. We remain encouraged by our initial investments in convenience properties that do not have a traditional large format tenant, especially given the advancements in geolocation data. As a result, this compelling sub-sector in open air shopping centers remains a key area of focus for the company.  The sub-sector stands to benefit from the pandemic-induced societal shifts like work-from-home and urban to suburban. Our property data aggregated over the past few years is showing a distinct rise in customer traffic, especially in wealthier suburbs where retail GLA per capita is low, and driving outsized rent growth in those same markets as evident in our own results. We are hyper focused on acquiring properties that fit these characteristics within our top markets since our portfolio has a weighted average population growth rate that’s double the national average. All of us at SITE Centers are incredibly proud of the work that generated our 2021 results and we’re even more excited about our growth prospects in 2022 and beyond.  With that, I’ll turn it over to Conor.
Conor Fenerty: Thanks David. I’ll comment first on fourth quarter results, then 2022 guidance, and conclude with our balance sheet. Fourth quarter results were ahead of plan, as David mentioned, on really all fronts. Total uncollectible revenue at SITE share included $1.4 million of income or $0.01 per share from payments and settlements related to prior periods. Ancillary income, overage rent, and occupancy also were well above plan, which in aggregate totaled another penny relative to budget, with the balance of the outperformance due to a number of smaller line items. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was up 40 basis points sequentially, which is on top of 50 basis points last quarter and comes despite the negative impact from fourth quarter transaction activity. Based on our current leasing pipeline that David outlined, we continue to see additional upside to the company’s lease rate given current activity and the level of demand across our portfolio.  Despite 111,000 square feet or $2.7 million of annualized base rent commencing in the fourth quarter, our SNO pipeline increased to $15 million from $12 million last quarter. We provide an updated schedule on the expected ramp of the pipeline on Page 9 of our earnings slides. The SNO pipeline now represents 4% of annualized fourth quarter base rent, or over 5% if you also include leases in negotiation in our pipeline. Moving onto our outlook, we are introducing 2022 OFFO guidance with a range of $1.08 to $1.13 per share. Rent commencements, uncollectible revenue and transaction timing are the largest swing factors expected to impact full year results and where we end up in the range. We have also introduced same store NOI guidance with a range of 2.25 to 4.25, adjusting for the roughly $14 million impact of 2021 uncollectible revenue. 2022 same store guidance implies that comparable property NOI will be ahead of 2019 levels, highlighting the strength of the portfolio’s recovery and recent and forecast rent commencements. Details on same store NOI are in our press release and earnings slides.  Additional assumptions for full year 2022 guidance include net investment activity of $100 million, the settlement of the $35 million of forward ATM shares in the first half of the year, RVI fees of about $1 million, joint venture fees of $8 million to $10 million, and interest expense at SITE share roughly flat from 2021. Lastly, included in 2021 results are $13.8 million or $0.07 per share of non-recurring reserve reversals related to prior periods. We have not budgeted additional reserve reversals in the bottom half of our guidance range. In terms of the first quarter of 2022, there are a few moving pieces to consider from the fourth quarter of 2021. First, as I previously mentioned, we had $1.4 million of non-recurring uncollectible revenue in the fourth quarter. Second, we had quite a bit of JV transaction activity in the fourth quarter. The assets sold in the quarter contributed $580,000 at SITE share of unconsolidated NOI and $465,000 of fees. Third, we expect RVI fees to be about $200,000 in the first quarter, which is down from $3.6 million in fourth quarter. A summary of these factors is on Page 11 of our earnings slides. Turning to our balance sheet, our COVID deferral program is effectively fully repaid with only a few hundred thousand dollars of receivables on the balance sheet at year end. In total, approximately $22 million of deferrals have been repaid to date, which represents 98% of total deferrals due to date. The rate of repayment, repaid dollars and collections, all of which have led the sector, highlight the strength of our national tenant roster. Finally wrapping up with liquidity and sources and uses, we received a $190 million distribution from RVI in the fourth quarter which was used to repay mortgage debt and acquire properties, as David outlined. At year end, leverage was 5.4 times, fixed charges over 4 times, and our unsecured debt yield was over 21%. The company has just over $40 million of cash on hand, $35 million of common equity from forward ATM sales available for future settlement, and full availability on our lines of credit. This capacity will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise and to drive sustainable OFFO growth and create stakeholder value. With that, I’ll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you Conor. Operator, we’re now ready to take questions.
Operator:  The first question will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to maybe start off with some questions about acquisitions. Appreciate the net acquisition guidance of $100 million - I think I have that right, but could you maybe break down what that is between buys and sells, and then maybe just talk about the acquisition market a little bit more. Our understanding is it’s pretty fierce out there. You seem to be doing a lot of JVs, which is great, so do you see those acquisitions coming from more JV buyouts or do you see opportunities to buy one-off properties?
Conor Fenerty: Rich, it’s Conor. I’ll let David take the second half of the question. In term of the gross volume, you’re right - it does imply additional JV transactions. If you look at our JV fees over the course of the year, you can see they are expected to climb year-over-year, which implies additional activity. We announced with the release the sale of the--the buy-sell provision for the SAU portfolio, which we’ll be selling our stake to our partner, so. We haven’t given the gross dollars, but the underlying activity really is additional JV sales, some modest wholly-owned sales as we continue to do annually over the last five-plus years, and I’ll defer to David on the state of the transaction market.
David Lukes: Yes Rich, I’m sure it’s not lost on you that the transaction market has been, I think fierce was the word you used. If you look on our supplemental on Page 18 and you see the transactions throughout the full year in 2021, the vast majority of our activity was off-market, and the off-market activity was primarily joint ventures but also a couple of unanchored strip properties that we bought off-market.  I would say in our unanchored thesis, we are finding more product simply because I think there’s less institutional capital chasing those size deals and those types of properties. It seems like most of the activity right now is still in the grocery sector, so I do feel pretty confident that we’ll be able to acquire enough assets to meet our budget. Then of course, there’s also just the larger question of capital allocation and our own stock price, so I do think we have options throughout the year and feel pretty good about the budget, despite the fact that the market is pretty hot.
Rich Hill: Got it. I was just channeling my 9-year-old daughter when I used fierce, so sorry for using that term.
David Lukes: That’s okay.
Rich Hill: Can you maybe talk through cap rates a little bit? When we’ve talked about it in the past, it seems like they’re ratcheting tighter and tighter. Are you seeing any floor? What should we think about as we think through 2022?
David Lukes: Well, if you don’t mind me pivoting a little bit, I think the larger question is what’s the unlevered IRR expectation, because we’re seeing so much rent growth and market rent growth in a lot of sub-markets, that I think it’s kind of a little bit of a head fake that cap rates are so low because the rent growth is actually there, so I think on an unlevered IRR, you can still buy really high quality assets at a 6% unlevered IRR. 
Rich Hill: Got it.
David Lukes: But because there’s so much growth, some of the cap rates in the 4s, for sure.
Rich Hill: Okay, that’s exactly what I was looking for. Conor, just one more question from me, if I can. I appreciate the disclosure on the $1.4 million of uncollectible revenue and then the $14 million that you disclosed in the guidance. Should we think about that $14 million as the right number for 2021 in aggregate, or is that a different number?
Conor Fenerty: No, I--
Rich Hill: I mean, like--go ahead?
Conor Fenerty: I apologise for cutting you off there, Rich. In terms of what’s on the balance sheet, like I said, we’ve only got a couple hundred thousand left on the balance sheet of receivables. There are fully reserved cash basis tenants that either have deferrals outstanding, taxes outstanding, or other reserves we’ve taken outstanding, so the total magnitude of that is probably closer to $10 million than $14 million. But that won’t all be recognized in 2022, and implicitly we don’t expect to recognize any of that. That being said, our collections team has done a really, really good job. I’m optimistic we’ll have more settlements over the course of the year, but I don’t envision it will be anywhere near the $13.8 million we had in 2021.
Rich Hill: Got it, thanks guys. I’ll jump back in the queue.
David Lukes: Thanks Rich.
Operator: The next question will come from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Hey Conor, just a question here on G&A for the year. What sort of run rate should we be thinking about? I know you’ve been doing a lot of acquisitions here. I’m just trying to get a little bit more view on the run rate.
Conor Fenerty: Hi, good morning Samir. I mentioned last quarter that we were targeting about $52 million, and that estimate is unchanged.
Samir Khanal: Okay, so that remains unchanged. Just remind me, sorry I missed this, but what’s the total bucket that you can still collect from, from a rent collection standpoint for past periods here?
Conor Fenerty: Yes, so one thing we’re pretty excited about is we collected effectively all of the rent from last year, so we were over 99%, and if you look in our slides, Samir, we’re up to 96% for the prior year, so in terms of just straight rent collections, the bucket’s shrinking, which is great. I think it speaks to, as David and I both mentioned, the credit quality of our tenant roster. Coming back to Richard’s question, it’s probably closer to just under $10 million for all outstanding rent, whatever might be receivables from tenants, but again effectively 99% of that is fully reserved, so each day we move past COVID, it’s harder and harder to collect on that, or implicitly there’s a lower probability of collections. Look - I’m optimistic we’ll have more collections over the course of the year, but in terms of just straight rent, we’re running out because our collections have been so high, which is great.
Samir Khanal: Okay, got it. I guess my final question is on--I mean, you’ve highlighted you’re looking at 19 additional anchors that you’re in negotiation with today, and you signed about 27 in 2021, right? From a leasing perspective, what are the differences you’re seeing in terms of annual rent bumps, or is there anything that you want to highlight here?
David Lukes: I wouldn’t say there’s any broad-based changes. Some of the reasons that you can get so much leasing done in one year is just the longstanding relationships with tenants. A number of the leases, we have been moving into fair market options as opposed to fixed options because it’s a better inflation hedge. Other than that, I think annual increases on the non-anchor spaces are definitely moving up. But for right now, I think our story going forward is the amount of anchors that have been leased in the last year has been nothing short of shocking, and I would expect the next six months to continue, which means that our next big wave is going to be the shop leasing. If you look on Page 10 of our supplement, you can see the commenced versus the leased rate on the shops, and you’ll notice a widening spread between leased and rent paying in the shop spaces - that’s, I think, going to be the story for this year, is that you’re going to start to see a lot of shop activity and that’s where a lot of growth is going to come from in the second half of the year.
Samir Khanal: Thanks so much.
David Lukes: You’re welcome. Thanks Samir.
Operator: The next question will come from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Tammi Fique: Thank you, good morning. Just wondering the same store NOI growth range for 2022, the 2.25 to 4.25, can you just talk about maybe the primary drivers of that growth - you know, how much of that is related to leasing that has already been completed and is just commencing in 2022, and maybe what the swing factors are that get you to the low and high end of that range. Thank you.
Conor Fenerty: Sure, hey Tammi, good morning. There’s a couple things to say. First off, just in terms of 2022, we’re coming off a really strong 2021, so we were positive 14.9% for 2021, which I think will be up there in terms of the sector, in terms of one of, it not the highest growth rates, so that’s one factor. The second one, as we’ve alluded to or explicitly mentioned a number of times, is the $13.8 million headwind from uncollectible revenue, as well as the fact that we collected all of our rent last year, so rent collections aren’t a tailwind. Really, the number one driver of next year is base rent growth, and what’s fascinating is when you kind of unpack base rent growth over the course of the year, we start the year in kind of mid-200, call it 2.5% base rent growth year-over-year, and we end up the year, at least based off our projections today, in the kind of mid-4s, so 4.5%. What’s driving that is this $15 million SNO pipeline, and what’s really interesting, while 80% of it commences next year, we’re only recognizing about half of the total dollars in terms of annualized dollars, so it sets us up really well in terms of back half of the year and into 2023, and it’s something we’re really excited about. That’s really what the driver is for next year, it’s all about leases commencing, and it’s the dollars coming on board in terms of dollars per share and total dollars, it’s pretty staggering relative to enterprise. 
Tammi Fique: Great, thanks. Maybe just one more question. What are you hearing from your tenants in terms of new store demand? Just trying to get a sense of how leasing activity will look in 2022 versus the strength you experienced in 2021, particularly given maybe the more volatile environment and supply chain issues, and other headwinds that we’re seeing. Thank you.
David Lukes: Well at this point, I think that the desire to grow footprint is pretty strong across almost every sector - discount, grocery, service tenants. There’s just a tremendous amount of demand. If you think about the shop leasing, it’s the highest in years and years, and anchor leasing is the highest in over four years. I don’t see it slowing down, Tammi, unless there is some macro event that causes an entire chain or a sector to kind of put the pause button on leasing. Right now, I don’t know what that would be, but the tenant sales are very strong. They seem to be not as concerned supply and labor. I would say that both the tenants and the landlords are having conversations about construction costs because with labor and supply chain and materials, that has been rising, and I think that’s a part of the reason why we’re driving rents up. But I think in general, the activity from the retailers is incredibly high right now.
Tammi Fique: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please go ahead.
Katy McConnell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Just given all the  leasing progress you’ve made, can you update us on your expectations for total capex spend in 2022, and would you expect this to remain elevated at a similar pace in 2023?
Conor Fenerty: Hey Katy, it’s Conor. I think you asked about capex spending, and correct me if I’m wrong, I’m sorry, but we do expect, to your point, given all the activity just in total leasing, whether it’s shops, anchors, and our redevelopment pipeline which we added a couple projects to this last quarter, we do expect capex to be up certainly over last year and definitely over 2020, which was depressed obviously given the initial COVID impact.  We haven’t given the total dollars, but I would just tell you based off our current budget at the midpoint, we expect to have retained cash flow of around $35 million, which equates to kind of a mid-70s payout ratio, which has been our target for the last couple of years. We’ve got the capital and the operating cash flow to fund capex, and to your point, as long as leasing activity remains elevated, capex will as well. That being said, we’re running out of space. I think to point back to Tammi’s question, what could impact leasing volume is simply running out of space, so our expectation is it will be elevated for this year and the start of next year, and then it will fall off fairly dramatically as we reach peak lease rate, peak occupancy.
Michael Bilerman: Hey Conor, it’s Michael Bilerman here with Katy. Can you just outline a little bit of the balance sheet moves and how they impact guidance this year? I think, at least in the supp, you talked about $35 million of settling the forward equity. I think you have the prefs midyear that carry a pretty high rate that can be redeemed. There’s a bunch of JV mortgage debt that I would assume has to get refinanced by the beginning of the second and end of the second quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what you have planned and what’s embedded from an accretion/dilution standpoint?
Conor Fenerty: Yes, thanks Michael. There’s not much embedded from an accretion/dilution standpoint - I’ll start there, just because we expect our share of interest expense to be effectively flat year-over-year, and you’re right, there are a number of moving pieces and we have a number of options, which is really exciting. You are correct - the Class A preferred are redeemable without penalty starting in June of this year. That is one option. We talked a lot about investment opportunities we’re excited about. If we can’t find them, we always have that, which is, to your point, a high coupon piece of paper. You’re right - there are some mortgages that are due. There are also, I think as Richard’s question around transactions, the expectation you’ll see the monetization of a number of joint ventures as well, which will take down that. From a refinancing perspective, I do think we’ll have a couple mortgages refinance this year; otherwise, I think you’re going to see transaction activity, net proceeds from transactions kind of satisfy those.  But I would just say a global answer to your question, our capital markets activity will be totally dependent on investment activity, meaning if we are able to find some opportunities that we like and think are accretive to the enterprise, then we’ll be more acquisitive--sorry, we expect to be more active on the debt and the equity side, obviously depending on where we see the best source or best cost of capital.  It’s a very long way of saying it’s totally dependent on transaction activity, but you’re right to point out there’s some exciting things and some higher cost of paper out there that we can now look to address, should we fail to find investment opportunities.
Michael Bilerman: So you have nothing from a positive refinancing perspective, even though you could argue that the mark-to-market of your debt and preferred would be highly accretive to cash flow and FFO?
Conor Fenerty: I don’t want to say we have nothing accretive from an opportunity perspective. As you pointed out, the prefs are carrying a low 6-handle coupon, so it’s a range, Michael. At the top end of the range, you should assume that we’re taking out some of the higher cost debt.  Also, we could look at liability manage as well. We’ve got some 23s and 24s that we could probably reissue accretively today, so I would just say on our base case budget, there’s nothing in there, but you’re right to point out that there’s some opportunities we have across the capital structure, but it’s totally dependent on investment activity.
Michael Bilerman: Okay, and then just lastly, just finishing this topic, you have, I think twice issued equity to redeem preferreds and de-lever the balance sheet. How are you thinking about common equity, because I do think that some of those historical--you know, when you’ve had a very high balance of preferreds relative to your enterprise value, you had the choice of replacing it with really cheap debt or more expensive equity, and you chose the de-leveraging path. Where is your mindset now in terms of equitizing the balance sheet?
Conor Fenerty: Yes, it’s a great question, and I would point to simple changes in our leverage profile. As I started my prepared remarks, Michael, we’re 5:4 debt to EBITDA, 21% unencumbered debt yield, over four times fixed charge, so I would tell you you’re right - when we did those first two trades, the preferred as a percentage of the total capital structure and our overall leverage was materially higher. We are in a materially different place today from an overall leverage perspective, so the sensitivity around issuing equity to take out prefs is extremely high.  That doesn’t mean we don’t look at it, we don’t consider it. As you know, we consider everything every single day in terms of every one of the levers we can pull. I would just tell you that that sensitivity is materially higher today given how lowly levered we are on an absolute, and certainly on a relative basis relative to peer group.
Michael Bilerman: Great, appreciate it. See you guys down in Florida.
Conor Fenerty: Thanks Michael.
Operator: The next question will come from Todd Thomas with Keybanc. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to first follow up on the joint venture commentary and the Madison or DDRIM JV in particular. There were some bits and pieces, I think, in your comments touching on this, but I wanted to ask about that joint venture and the latest thinking with regard to the remaining 24 assets there, gross real estate on the books of $760 million. What’s in the guidance for that JV throughout the year with $350 million of debt maturing in July?
David Lukes: Todd, let me start - it’s David, and then I can turn it over to Conor with respect to the budget.  The nice thing about having joint ventures is that there are times when the partner would like to sell and we can find assets that we think match our growth profile or exceed it. If you look at what we bought from Madison already, the SITE Centers grocery portfolio generates about $750 a square foot in grocer sales, and this portfolio is almost $800. The demographics are in the top quartile in the U.S. There’s a lot of similarities in the portfolio that we bought with our captive portfolio. The amount of inventory left in the DDRIM pool that is substantially similar to our core portfolio is shrinking, so I think the likelihood that we’ll continue to buy from that JV is probably smaller transactions and not portfolios like we’ve done in the past year.  As far as budget goes, I think Conor can probably speak to that better. 
Conor Fenerty: Yes, we can’t provide guidance on what our partners will do, ultimately it’s a partnership decision, Todd. I would just say our assumption is over the next couple of years, just given the life of that fund and the funds of some of the other partners involved, you’ll see continued asset sales and our budget reflects that. The total dollar amount could swing, and that’s why we have a range. As Michael alluded to, there is some debt that comes up this year, and at times when debt matures, that necessitates the end or monetization of a fund, so I think you’ll see some of the assets get refinanced, some of the assets get sold, and it will be really a range across our joint ventures. Our guidance reflects, as you’d assume, at the bottom end the most dilutive outcome of that transaction, and the top end assumes less transaction activity.  I would just say to David’s point, if we find an opportunity to acquire assets that have a growth rate at least commensurate with our portfolio, we’ll take advantage of it, and if not, then by definition we’re improving our overall portfolio quality. It’s just an opportunity for us to take some of our capital out of those joint ventures if we want, reinvest it elsewhere, pay down debt - whatever we want to do. Again, we can’t provide specifics on what each joint venture will be doing, but I would just say our range reflects what we think is a range of outcomes across the different partnerships.
Todd Thomas: Okay, got it. Then I think, David, in the past there was some commentary suggesting that there was interest in utilizing joint venture capital. You’re obviously talking about consolidating interest and seeing a decrease in activity today, but on the other hand, it seems like you’re finding a lot of investment opportunities - anchored, non-anchored, product. What’s the current view of either inking a new joint venture partnership or utilizing joint venture capital going forward?
David Lukes: I think going forward, I would always like to have a joint venture arm of our business. I think we have a very, very long track record with some very large institutions. We just recently did a look back on a number of the JVs we’ve had over the past five or six years, and I think we’ve been a very good partner to a lot of pretty sophisticated capital.  I think you’re seeing the benefits of having a joint venture business now, when it’s hard to acquire assets and we’ve got inside information and experience on captive portfolios that we can purchase when the time’s right, so I’d like to see us rebound a little bit and grow that joint venture business. I’m not sure if this year is the time that that will happen, but long term I think it’s always going to be a part of our enterprise.
Todd Thomas: Okay, and then just lastly, Conor, you said you see current upside to the portfolio’s lease rate, and you and David talked about the 500,000 square feet of new lease deals in negotiation and the signed not occupied pipeline. Can you just share what’s in guidance for occupancy during the year, and any color on maybe tenant move-outs or whether you expect to see a moderation in lease and occupancy rates to start the year, as you might typically see on a seasonal basis or any space recaptures or anything like that, or do you see the lease and occupancy rate gains just carrying straight through the year?
Conor Fenerty: Todd, I’ll let David talk about the lease rate and how the demand factors into that. I think to your last point, though, our expectation is you’re going to see a steady increase over the course of the year, definitely in terms of occupancy and certainly in terms of the lease rate as well. In terms of occupancy, by the fourth quarter of this year--the fourth quarter of next year, excuse me, the expectation is to see a couple hundred basis points of occupancy increase. I will tell you the percentage is always going to be misleading, just based off rent and GLA, etc., but from an economic or a rent-adjusted occupancy, we expect this to be up over 200 basis points over the course of the year.
David Lukes: Yes Todd, I would just say that we obviously don’t guide or provide guidance on occupancy at year end, but from a lease rate perspective, the demand right now is so strong to lease space, both in shops and anchors, if this pace continues, then I think we’ll be stabilized from a leased rate perspective by the end of the year, which I would say is 95%, 96%.  What can change that is what we purchase, so last quarter we purchased vacancy, and that’s part of the strategic move. I think for the core portfolio today, we seem like we’re trending pretty quickly to full stabilization, but I’d love to see us buy a little bit more vacancy.
Conor Fenerty: And Todd, there’s nothing coming--I failed to mention this, there’s nothing coming offline in terms of anchors or redev or anything like that impacting the course of 2022.
Todd Thomas: Okay, thank you.
Conor Fenerty: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning gentlemen. Just a few questions, and maybe continuing on the JV theme. David, I appreciate your comments that on your look-back, you guys have done really well on the JVs. On the other hand, I think when you guys came in and took over running SITE Centers, there was a big focus on simplifying a lot of legacy JVs and getting rid of a lot of housecleaning to simplify the company, simplify the NOI structure. Did the China deal--I think that may have been two years ago, three years ago, I forget, but that’s been pretty quiet, so maybe you can just talk a little bit more about what your enthusiasm for joint ventures is now compared to the housecleaning you did over the past number of years, and then two, are there--when you say you’re excited about joint ventures, is this more one-offs or are you thinking about a fund, like Boston Properties has dedicated joint venture partners that they use on deals, are you thinking something like that?
David Lukes: Yes, it’s a great question, Alex, because you’re right - we spent a number of years simplifying the portfolio, and to be perfectly frank, this is the year we’re dealing with the final shift from fee income to property NOI, and there’s a higher multiple on property NOI than there is fee income. My critique of the unwind of a lot of those legacy JVs was just simply that they were very, very large joint ventures, and our fees were somewhat low. When they get too large, then the enterprise becomes a lot more about the JV business and less about the wholly owned, and so I think it starts to impact how people view your portfolio. I’m much happier with the simplicity we have today.  When I talk about JVs in the future, I’m really not talking about anything imminent, I’m just saying that as part of an overall business plan, it’s nice to have access to capital partners that have a similar viewpoint as yours and can probably provide capital for a strategy that you may not be able to put 100% into. That could occur if we found a portfolio we liked but it was too large and we wanted to bring in a partner. It could happen if we had a strategy that is maybe a long duration strategy and we wanted to find a partner that had that same viewpoint.  But at the end of the day, what you’re really trying to do is build up inventory that you might be purchasing 100% of in a number of years, and one of the ways to make sure you’re always able to access off-market deals is to have long-term joint ventures with institutions that you can access those investments at a later date. I think it’s just more of a long-term viewpoint.  I see joint ventures as being an important part of our business, but I really do think they need to serve a purpose, and I think you need to get paid for that service you’re providing them.
Conor Fenerty: The only other thing, Alex, if you remember the joint ventures that, to use your phrasing, we cleaned up a couple years ago, there was a stark contrast in terms of growth rates and quality versus the wholly-owned portfolio as well. If you remember, Michael asked the question, I think it was three or four years ago about why there was such a differential between same store NOI at 100% and our share, and the truth of the matter was the JVs were a drag, and we talked about that when we unwound a couple of them. That’s another point to David’s commentary, the JVs today are consistent with our portfolio quality. They’re growing at a very similar rate, and to David’s point, if we could find assets that are also growing at similar rates, and then we’d add to them and add them to the enterprise.
Alexander Goldfarb: On just the other part of that question, are you guys looking to do a strategic audio  or some sort of GIC, or something like that, like a dedicated third party capital source, or David, you’re looking at these as just making sure that you have a rolodex of a lot of different JV partners who think the same way you do and as things come up, it would be sort of a one-off?
David Lukes: The latter.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Then second question is on the--I hear your enthusiasm for the leasing demand, and certainly we’ve been holding that for quite a while now. But just curious, there is a point of structural vacancy - you know, I think your portfolio is probably lower on that just because it’s more big box, less on the small shop, but still, is there a point where you’re like, hey, we could have all the demand that we want but for the street, keep in mind that even getting to the 94, 95, maybe that in itself is really difficult just given natural churn and time it takes to open, etc. What’s sort of a realistic number that we can think about versus what an optimum level is?
David Lukes: Well, that’s a tough question to answer. I see your point. I mean, historically I would say that 95 to 96% is stabilized, and the reason is you’ve always got a little bit of bankruptcy every year, a little bit of move-outs, and when you have a larger space move out, the downtime does have an effect over the course of the year. That’s why I’ve always felt like 95 to 96% is really a stabilized portfolio. I’m personally very curious what happens in this cycle, because I think that retail in wealthy suburbs are running out of space, and it’s a little bit strange to say that given that we’re still in COVID, but demand is so high, what’s really happening, Alex, is that the tenants are renewing at a much higher rate than they used to, and they’re hitting their options at a much higher rate than they used to, even in the good times six or seven years ago. If the retention rate goes up, it means that by definition, you have fewer move-outs and fewer bankruptcies, and if this cycle has more of that and if rents are growing, it means fewer tenants can move because the rents for new construction become higher. It could kind of test that cap of 95 to 96%. The second piece of that puzzle I also think is the middle-sized spaces; in other words, junior anchors and then small shops have a long history of maintaining high occupancy. It’s that kind of 6,000 to 10,000 square foot space that’s always been a little bit difficult. What’s changed in the last year is you have some very, very large new concepts, particularly pOpshelf and Gopuff that are starting to really look hard at wealthy suburbs in that size range, and that does change the dynamic. If you can get credit tenants in space that are that middle size, that can have a material impact on retention rates going forward. 
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks Alex.
Operator: The next question will come from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Thanks guys, morning. I had a question on the rationale behind the convenience investments and how should investors think about that, and how would you--the convenience, i.e. the non-anchored space that you’re buying, how does that compare to traditional street retail in your view in terms of the throughputs or the people who go by there? You said you looked at some close data for cell phone usage, etc. Maybe you can give us some more insight on why you feel so comfortable buying unanchored parts or retail right now in the convenience segment.
David Lukes: Yes, sure Floris. It’s probably a longer discussion than earnings call, but I guess in the most simplistic form, I think before cell phone data allowed landlords and tenants to understand shopping traffic, you had to rely on one of two things: either you’re relying on an anchor traffic, like a grocery store, a mass merchant or a discounter, or a department store, or you’re relying on pedestrian activity, which tends to be street retail, high street retail. Those two things drove traffic, and so the assumption was that if traffic was there, the tenants could measure their probable sales.  What’s changed with geolocation data is that you don’t have to rely on the anchor anymore. You really can look at the current productivity of the existing tenants, you can measure where the customers are coming from and why - are they coming from work, are they going to work, are they just coming from their homes, are they coming from school, and the retailers have all figured this out. If you look at the two properties that we bought in Charlottesville in the last couple of months, the tenants are Verizon, Cava, Starbucks, and a Wells Fargo - those are sophisticated tenants. They have geolocation data themselves. We have the same data, and I think both of us agree that there’s a reason why they’re there, and so if we can buy that property and understand the rent growth and the lack of capex in that asset class, you don’t really have to rely on a traditional anchor, and that’s why I think the thesis for us makes sense. You’ve got data to understand it, you know the capex is low and you know the rent is more likely to keep up with mark-to-market because you can capture shorter term leases. Those are the input assumptions. The one thing I’ll just remind you is that there is a big difference between convenience properties and street retail, and it has everything to do with parking and convenience, and we are all in the suburban parking, convenient, close to the curb. We’re less interested in street retail where it’s really pedestrian or it’s daily office traffic - that’s not part of our thesis.
Floris van Dijkum: Great, thanks David. That’s it for me.
David Lukes: Thanks Floris.
Operator: The next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. In terms of the space running out in wealthy suburbs and retailers signing on at higher rents, how much would you attribute this to work-from-home, hybrid working models, pandemic-induced migration or retailers coming out of lower quality malls? Does your traffic data help you parse out any of this data?
David Lukes: Yes, it’s very interesting, Linda. A year ago, I think what we were saying was the balance sheets of the retailers got better and therefore they could grow their businesses. That was the primary driver, was balance sheets were significantly better coming out of that first year in COVID.  I think what’s changed, my own personal view, is that the data is showing us and the tenants are telling us that they’re betting that hybrid work is going to be a long term part of the U.S. white collar workforce, and they’re willing to make bets on that, given their sales and higher productivity. The hybrid workforce is showing up in the data - that doesn’t’ surprise you any given that people are still remote, but the amount of customer traffic during the weekday as opposed to the weekend is substantially different than it was three years ago. I think the number of trips per week has gone up, the duration that a customer stays on the property has gone slightly down. Why is that? It’s likely because people are doing more short trips and you’re starting to see the impact of a lot of these ghost shoppers that are showing up at the properties to grab items that you purchased online and they’re being fulfilled from the store fleet, so that’s why you’re seeing some of this data prove that the ghost shopping business is having a very positive effect on suburban strip centers. I think those are the primary reasons, Linda. I wouldn’t put a huge impact from mall tenants moving to the strips. I think the much larger driver of this leasing volume is retailers just trying to get their fulfillment into the last mile of wealthy suburbs.
Linda Tsai: Thanks, and then some of your peers have discussed challenges in getting new tenant open and operating on time. Is this something that you guys are seeing in your portfolio?
David Lukes: Last year, it was definitely challenging from a building permit standpoint; in other words, the local building permit counters were slow and they started to get a lot of building applications, they were still remote. I spoke to our head of construction and development yesterday, and what he’s seeing is that the building permits are starting to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, they’re getting a little bit faster, so I think permitting has gotten better. What’s gotten worse is the procurement of some of the long lead items, like insulation and roofing and HVAC equipment. I think most landlords and tenants, including us, are just starting to buy those long lead items earlier in the construction process. For instance, when the lease gets signed, we’re ordering MEP units and roofing materials, whereas in past years we might have waited three or four months to get closer to permit. A lot of that, I think, supply chain has just been solved by buying things earlier. We haven’t had--I mean, I don’t think we had any tenants last year miss their opening date because of either labor or materials, or permitting.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Hey, good morning guys. Just a couple from me. On your same store NOI guide, I guess maybe you could help us think about some of the drags on your outlook as it relates to how bad debt expectations are in your current forecast versus, say, pre-pandemic, and same thing with tenant fallout. David, you commented a bit on tenant fallout, I just want to understand how you’re thinking about it relative to your same store NOI guide.
Conor Fenerty: Hey Chris, it’s Conor. The biggest driver, as we’ve laid out in the guidance table, is uncollectible revenue. It should be, to your point, an expense, not a source of income, and we expect it to be an expense in 2022. That’s the number one driver in terms of the headwinds. There are some smaller paper cuts - you know, our ancillary income will be lower year-over-year because we have less vacancy to lease to tenants. That’s another one, but again it’s a paper cut. The number one driver really is just uncollectible revenue shifting from a source of income to an expense. In terms of bad debt, to your question, our expectations around bankruptcies, about move-outs, around anything that would be a drag from an operations perspective are materially lower today than they were pre-COVID. I think if you recall from our investor day three or four years ago, we talked about 150 basis points annually of bad debt, bankruptcies, kind of everything rolled in there. Today I think that number is much closer to 50 basis points, and our range includes somewhere--you know, a little bit above that, a little bit below that.  It is a materially different operating environment. David talked about our retention rates earlier. Our known move-outs or expected move-outs is down dramatically as well, so really what’s driving 2022 is uncollectible revenue.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thanks for that. Then just quickly on the acquisitions for the fourth quarter, can you give me a sense as to what that cap rate was broadly at your share?
David Lukes: Well Chris, I think in my prepared remarks, what I said was if you look at the blended overall cap rate for the activity in last year, it was just under 6%, but we haven’t broken it down by transaction and particularly from joint venture partners. I don’t think we would ever release cap rates on a specific transaction.
Chris Lucas: And then David, the leasing volume split GLA last year was 50/50 on new leases. What are your expectations between shop and anchor leasing volume on new leases in 2022? Any sense in terms of how that should play out?
David Lukes: Chris, I’m sorry - I could barely hear you. Could you say it again?
Chris Lucas: Yes, I’m sorry, David. Leasing volume for 2021 between anchor and shop space was 50/50 in terms of the GLA on new leases. What are your expectations for 2022 with that split between shop and anchor?
Conor Fenerty: Hey Chris, it’s Conor. I think in the first half of the year, it will probably be consistent with 2021, that kind of equal split. As we talked about at your conference and at NAREIT, we are running out of boxes, and so boxes will naturally fall off, so I think based off our current forecast, and this could obviously change tomorrow, probably that split would be even or consistent with 2021 in the first half of the year and then you’d see a higher percentage of shops in the back half of the year, but that’s just a guess. 
Chris Lucas: Okay, and then last question from me, specific to Paradise Village, interesting to buy vacancy out from a partner. Is there anything that you can chat about that gives some background on why that transaction worked for you guys and not for your partner?
David Lukes: Yes, I think that’s pretty simple. It’s in a very wealthy sub-market. Our vice president of leasing for the west coast lives a couple blocks away, so there’s a personal agenda there to have 100% ownership. It was an old Albertson’s anchored property where we were able to buy back the ground lease from Albertson’s, which effectively created that vacancy at a pretty low cost. The challenge for our partner is that they’re a private entity and it takes a lot of capital to reposition the property, and so we were able to negotiate a price at which we were happy with the growth and the cost of that growth, and they were happy with exiting the property and letting somebody else effectively redevelop the property.
Chris Lucas: Thank you, appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yes, hi. Sorry for another JV question, but just a quick one here. Just curious, what was the trigger that prompted you to sell the JV for the Utah JV, actually, that saw you taking it?
David Lukes: Yes, that’s a good question. It comes down to what’s most similar to our wholly owned portfolio and accretive, and what is least similar and dilutive. From DDRM Madison pool, as I mentioned, if we’re buying grocers at $800 a square foot and our portfolio generates $750, it’s in the top quartile of demographics nationwide, it has a lot of similarities in location in terms of being mostly in Florida. The SAU portfolio was different - it was much more rural, it’s in the bottom quartile of demographics, the densities are much, much less, the household incomes are more blue collar whereas ours are more upper middle income and high income, and most of the grocery stores in that pool were doing less than $500, $550 a foot, so it really just didn’t have the growth and the durability that we look for in our own acquisitions, so we were happy to basically recycle our 20% out of that portfolio and reinvest it somewhere else.
Mike Mueller: Got it. That was it, thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks, good morning. Just a couple questions on leasing. Given that you’re reaching mid-90% lease rates, how should we think about your pricing power and lease spreads going forward?
David Lukes: Yes Ki Bin, I think that’s going to be the--I mean, it’s already started where the pricing power that the landlord has is much more than two years ago, three years ago. I mean, it has definitely tilted in the favor of the landlord, and I think you’re starting to see that in spreads.  I think that once we start to run out of box space, then the competition increases for the shops, and so I think we’ll see the most growth in the shops in the back half of the year. I also think that the longer the economy does well, particularly with just a little bit of inflation which is good for retailers, you’re going to see a lot more aggressive behavior from some of these tenants that really need to secure space. There’s been a half dozen very high quality restaurants that have gone public, there’s a bunch of tenants that are being sponsored by investment-grade tenants. I would point to pOpshelf, which is a Dollar General concept, and they’re doing fantastic. That type of tenant that’s high credit and has to roll out because they’ve got an open to buy, the space is getting more competitive.  I, like you, am very curious to see how high the rents get, but we’ve hit all-time highs in shop rents in a number of our sub-markets, including Miami, Cleveland, Portland and Boston, and I mean shop rents that are $50, $60, $70, $80, $90 a foot, and I hope that continues. I think as long as the economy keeps humming along, we’re going to be very careful about leasing to credit as opposed to local, because I think that’s going to inure to the benefit of our stakeholders once the next recession comes.
Ki Bin Kim: A couple follow-ups there. Given your lease expiration schedule and the options for big boxes, how much are you actually getting to on an annual basis? That one first.
Conor Fenerty: Ki Bin, that’s a great point. If you look historically, new leasing activity has generally been about 10% to 15% of total leasing volume, so you’re right - the negative is potentially you could have tenants hitting options. The great part about that, as David has alluded to a number of times, it means no downtime, no capital, and a 5% to 10% bump or even higher for some of the fair market value options we have. It’s a double-edged sword, but I would tell you from our perspective, it’s a net positive. 
Ki Bin Kim: And what is implicit in your guidance for lease spreads?
Conor Fenerty: We haven’t guided to lease spreads historically. If you remember from our investor day, Ki Bin, our view is that renewals, which generally the majority of which are options, are going to be in that 2.5% to 7.5% range, and for new leases you’re starting to see the re-acceleration from the COVID trough - you know, we’ve done anywhere between 10% and 30% historically, so I would be surprised to see on a trailing 12-months numbers outside of those ranges, but given how focused we are from portfolio-wise, one lease can really move the needle positively or negatively.  I think just historically, that trailing 12-month number is the right one to use, and until we say otherwise, I think it’s appropriate going forward.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay, thank you.
Conor Fenerty: You’re welcome.
David Lukes: Thanks Ki Bin.
Operator: The next question will be a follow-up from Katy McConnell with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: It’s Michael Bilerman. Just a real quick follow-up. David or Conor, the Madison JV, did it have any sort of promote feature in it that would have benefited your purchase price at all?
David Lukes: No.
Michael Bilerman: So it’s just a clean buy-sell, or it was a negotiated deal?
David Lukes: A little bit of both. The one in Arizona was a negotiated unwind, SAU was a clean buy-sell, and Madison was a little bit of a combination of the two.
Michael Bilerman: And Madison, who approached who? Was Madison approaching you to liquidate the assets and then you chose, or you approached them to buy these assets?
David Lukes: It’s a little bit of both, Michael, and I’m not trying to be evasive. It’s just there were several different debt pools in that joint venture, it’s a very sophisticated partner, Madison. They have their own desires as to when they want to exit portfolios or properties, and we have certain ones we want and other ones that don’t fit, so it’s a little bit of both.
Michael Bilerman: Then when you look back, if memory serves, this was the old  portfolio from 2007, that I know a bunch of t hose assets were probably developed in the early 2000s, or bought. But effectively, now you’ve got a 15-year performance history from when DDR originally acquired the assets, Year 10 you’re recapped with Madison and now at Year 15 you’ve taken in, call it a third of the portfolio. How has NOI trended for this group of assets that you just bought over the last 10 to 15 years, and how do you look at relative value today versus when you did the deal in 2017 and 2007? I’m just trying to get a picture of how these assets have performed over time.
David Lukes: Well as you know, we don’t report segmentated NOI by portfolio, so that’s a tough one to answer. I’d say from a value perspective, if grocery cap rates are where they are today and where they were even five years ago, it’s not hard to imagine that this portfolio has done pretty well from a value standpoint. But from an NOI standpoint, it’s really tough to answer.
Michael Bilerman: I mean, 2007 was a peak Q in terms of pricing and there was a pretty robust level of NOI, and you could almost say the same thing about ’17, so it’s just interesting data points from a transaction perspective, but I would also assume that from an NOI, I would hope that you’d be able to at least comment on here’s the average base rent of the portfolio, this is how it’s grown, this is--you know? Just to give a little bit more color on how--whether these have been good outperformers, have they been in-line performers, have they been underperformers. Just trying to get a relative sense, but we can--it doesn’t sound like you may have the data at your fingertips, so maybe we can follow up after.
David Lukes: Sure.
Michael Bilerman: Great, thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks Michael.
Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
David Lukes: Thank you for joining our call, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect. "
55,SITC,1,2022,2022-04-26 14:29:02,"Operator: Good day and welcome to the SITE Centers First Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Monica Kukreja, Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Monica Kukreja: Thank you, Operator. Good morning and welcome to SITE Centers’ first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes, and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fenerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and slide presentation on our website at www.sitecenters.com, which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today’s call. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today’s call, including FFO, operating FFO, and same store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today’s quarterly financial supplement. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. We had an excellent start to the year with OFFO ahead of plan, another quarter of record leasing volume and the investment of the remaining proceeds from the $190 million distribution from RBI in three compelling properties. On top of all this, our balance sheet remains in great shape with debt-to-EBITDA in the low fives at quarter end, which is well-ahead of the peer group and the sector overall, which provides capacity for continued external growth. I'll start this morning discussing first quarter results, talk briefly about leasing and tenant demand and then discuss our investments and capital allocation as we look to grow our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. As I mentioned, first quarter OFFO was ahead of our budget on better operations, which Conor will provide more details on later. Our strongest tenants continue to take market share and our construction and property management teams have done a great job getting tenants open for business ahead of schedule, which is part of our out-performance this quarter. Moving to leasing. Tenant demand remains elevated across the portfolio, and we built upon our fourth quarter activity with another quarter of record volume relative to the last five years. Shop leasing, in particular, continued to surprise to the upside with a number of key deals with first-to-portfolio tenants, including several leases at our tactical redevelopment projects in Princeton, Boston and Portland. To put shop leasing volume in context, in the last 12 months, we signed 62% more square feet of shops than in 2018 and 52% more square feet than in 2019. The success and the quality of our leasing is giving us increased visibility and confidence on our allocation of capital, which I'll discuss later in my remarks. Looking forward, we have another 600,000 square feet at share in lease negotiations, which we expect to be completed in the next six months with similar characteristics to the deals we signed in 2021 and year-to-date in 2022, meaning a concentration on national publicly traded tenants with excellent credit. We continue to expect leasing to be the material driver of our growth over the next several years. Shifting to investments. We had another very active quarter buying out a partner in Orlando and adding convenience properties in Boca Raton and Scottsdale. I'll start with our two Florida acquisitions. With Casselberry Commons, we acquired another public-anchored property from our partner. We obviously know the property well and have significant leasing momentum with two recently signed anchors and elevated shop demand. The asset is accretive to our grocery-anchored portfolio and well above national average sales and an underwritten five-year NOI CAGR of almost 9% in an excellent submarket with great demographics. At shops at Boca Center, we acquired for $90 million, an asset that has all of the attributes of the convenience properties that we've been focused on and investing in. Excellent demographics with trade area household incomes of $126,000, convenient access and parking and a site plan that offers a mix of simple liquid shops in demand from a wide range of national, regional and local tenants. Despite a total GLA of just 117,000 square feet, the property draws from an actual trade area of over 600,000 customers, resulting in high tenant volumes as the restaurant sales alone averaged almost $1,000 a square foot. With lease-up, mark-to-market and a new pad opportunity, shops at Boca, has an underwritten five-year NOI CAGR of over 7%, which instantly adds to the company's growth profile. Pro forma for these two acquisitions, Florida now represents over 20% of the company's value. And there is an excellent representation of SITE Centers portfolio overall with a diverse mix of assets located in the wealthiest submarkets of the state and populated by national credit tenants. The portfolio includes convenience properties like the shops at Boca Center and shops at Addison Place in Delray Beach, dominant regional properties like the shops in Midtown, Miami, in downtown Miami and Winter Garden Village in Orlando. Grocery-anchored properties like Casselberry Commons in Orlando and the shops at New Tampa. The SITE Center's Florida portfolio has an expected five-year NOI CAGR of over 4%, average household income, 70% higher than the national average and an average expected population growth 200 basis points higher than the country overall. It's an irreplaceable collection of properties in a high-growth state, and we're excited about the prospects for additional investments in our other key submarkets. Moving to Phoenix. We bought another convenience property in the core Scottsdale submarket and are confident we can find more opportunities to grow our portfolio in this key market. The Scottsdale corridor has incomes of over $148,000 and significant population growth, attracting a wide range of tenants, including a mix of food service and service users. Going forward, I continue to expect us to be active in both anchored and unanchored assets that fit our growth in submarket criteria. That said, we remain encouraged by our investments in convenience properties, and this compelling subsector in open-air shopping centers, remains a key area of focus for the company. Over the last few years, we've invested over $300 million at a blended cap rate of roughly 5.5% in convenience asset with average household income of $117,000 and an underwritten five-year CAGR of 4% with minimal CapEx. Each of these properties, all located in key markets for the company, including Miami, Scottsdale and Atlanta will be drivers of the company's future growth. The convenience subsector is clearly benefiting from recent societal shifts favoring hybrid work and suburban housing growth. Our property data aggregated over the past few years is showing a distinct rise in customer traffic, especially in wealthier suburbs, where it’s difficult getting new retail construction approved or pencil given rising construction cost and it's driving outsized rent growth due to the scarcity of convenience retail locations close to where people are now living and working in greater numbers. You'll see us to continue to pursue this external growth strategy and we've been diligently focused on sourcing a pipeline of potential deals that fit our investment criteria and our return hurdles. Thank you to the entire SITE Centers team for an excellent start to the year. We've been hard at work for some of the time, positioning the company to outperform and remain excited about the prospects for the remainder of 2022. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.
Conor Fenerty: Thanks, David. I'll comment first on quarterly results, discuss our revised 2022 guidance and some of the moving pieces heading into the second quarter and then conclude the balance sheet. First quarter results were ahead of plan as David mentioned, due to a number of operational factors, including earlier rent commencements, higher-than-budgeted occupancy due to higher retention rates and higher ancillary income. These operational factors totaled about $0.01 per share relative to budget.  The quarter also included $675,000 of higher-than-expected straight line rent from the conversion of cash basis tenants and $1.3 million from payments and settlements related to prior periods. Both of these nonrecurring items totaled another $0.01 per share relative to budget. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was up 50 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year with our lease rate now at 93.2%.  Leasing activity remains elevated across all unit sizes and based on our current leasing pipeline, we continue to see upside to the company's current lease rate and well beyond pre-COVID high watermarks. Highlighting our leasing velocity, the SNO pipeline increased to $18 million from $15 million last quarter. These signed leases now represent almost 5% of annualized first quarter base rent or over 6%, if you also include leases in negotiation in our pipeline. We provided our updated schedule on the expected ramp of the pipeline on Page Six of our earnings slides and expect over 60% of the leases commenced by year-end 2022.  Moving on to our outlook. We are raising our 2022 OFFO guidance to a range of $1.10 to $1.15 per share. Rent commencements, uncollectible revenue and transaction timing remain the largest swing factors expected to impact full year results and where we end up in the revised range. We are also raising same-store NOI guidance to a range of 3% to 4.5% adjusting for the roughly $14 million impact of 2021 uncollectible revenue.  Details on same-store NOI are in our press release and earnings slides. In terms of additional assumptions for full year 2022 guidance, RVI and JV guidance ranges remain unchanged, along with our assumption for roughly flat interest expense at SITE share versus 2021. In terms of investments, we continue to expect net investment activity of $100 million for the full year. Given, year-to-date net investment activity of $113 million, we are assuming that acquisitions are essentially match funded with dispositions through year-end.  Lastly, we have not budgeted additional reserve reversals in the bottom half of our guidance range. In terms of the second quarter of 2022, there are a few moving pieces to consider from the first quarter of 2022. First, as I previously mentioned, we had $1.3 million of nonrecurring uncollectible revenue and $675,000 of nonrecurring straight line rent in the first quarter. Second, we closed on the sale of the SAU portfolio subsequent to quarter end. These assets generated about $1 million in JV fees on an annual basis. Third, we settled the forward ATM shares in the first quarter, which will increase the second quarter weighted average share count by about 1.5 million shares sequentially. A summary of these factors is on Page 9 of our earnings slides. Ending with our balance sheet at quarter end, leverage was 5.1x, fixed charge was over 4x and our unsecured debt yield was roughly 21% as we continue to unencumber wholly-owned properties as mortgages mature. The company has just under $20 million of cash on hand and $855 million of availability on our lines of credit. This capacity will allow us to take advantage of future investment opportunities as they arise and to drive sustainable growth and create stakeholder value. And with that, I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator:  First question today will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Rich Hill: Hey. Good morning, guys. David, I wanted to go back to the comment that you made, and hopefully, I'm not putting words in your mouth, that leasing is going to drive your future growth. And so, I was maybe hoping to unpack where you think occupancy can go? I think occupancy is around 93.8% right now, is obviously a little bit lower. But as we think about occupancy relative to history, do you think you can back to 95.7% where you were in 2014, or do you think a peak in 2019 of around 94%, a little bit higher than that is a better proxy?
David Lukes: It's a really good question, Rich. No, you did not put words in my mouth. It's funny -- with another 0.5 million square feet or 600,000 square feet under lease negotiation right now, we just haven't really seen the risk of this level of demand in wealthy suburbs go down. And so I think our confidence level that we can get back to the high watermark is pretty high.
Conor Fenerty: Yeah. Rich, I mean, we made the comment, David, this quarter and the prior quarter as well. The high watermark for this portfolio, I think, was 93.9, three years ago. We think we can do better than that. If you recall, we held quite a bit of space offline for potential redevelopments, and we've either chose to proceed with those redevelopments or decide to release the space just in terms of a retail project. So we think we've said kind of 94% to 95% leased is achievable, and there's a bull scenario where we get as high as 96%. So again, just to reiterate David's point from our script in a minute ago, we think there's still considerable upside from a lease and occupancy perspective.
Rich Hill: Okay. Thank you. And I wanted to maybe talk about the interest rate environment and ask a two-part question, both in terms of what interest rates are doing to cap rates, if anything, at this point? And does that give you actually even more competitive advantage. So does it shake out some of the smaller, less institutional owners of open-air shopping centers. And then I recognize you're funding yourself, you're funding acquisitions with dispositions for the remainder of the year. But maybe we could just have a quick conversation about, if you prefer equity over debt at current valuations?
David Lukes: Well, I'll start with the cap rates and then Conor can take the equity side of the equation. But Rich, there seems to be in the last 60 days, a tale of two cities with respect to properties that are in the market. And I'll just remind you that 30,000 strip centers in the US, we own 92 of them. We're very focused on what we want to buy. So, I'm not sure that my comments are going to be taken as a proxy for the industry. But for what we're looking at, when we see properties that are fully leased, the tenants have long-term, and therefore, the growth rate of the NOI is somewhat low. I do think that higher borrowing rates will have an effect in the next month or two as we start to see sellers not being able to achieve what they could before because the competing buyers are levered buyers, and we're generally an unlevered buyer. The irony is that at the same time, we're buying assets like Boca that have a really high CAGR, and that's partly because of occupancy and partly because of tenant rollover and a mark-to-market. And so if you're getting rents that are rising along with interest rates, it means that to hold the same unlevered IRR, even in the face of rising borrowing rates, I do think that cap rates are holding up pretty well for growth assets, even though they might move a little bit for more flat stable assets. So, that's kind of where I'm seeing things in the last couple of weeks.
Rich Hill: Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for on sort of the question about unlevered IRR versus levered IRR. So, thank you for that. Conor, any thoughts on equity versus debt here?
Conor Fenerty: I was hoping you forgot about that part of the question. We're really comfortable with our leverage right now. As you know, it took us five years to get here, and we're looking to maintain what we think are prudent leverage and duration level. So, it's always going to be a mix. We've got retained cash flow. We've got disposition proceeds you referenced. We've got the SAU proceeds that post quarter end. So, it's always a balance. I would just say we're really encouraged by our balance sheet position at this time.
Rich Hill: Okay. Thank you very much guys.
Conor Fenerty: Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks Rich.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, thanks for that. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of the pipeline that you have right now from an acquisition perspective? And how much you have on the market from a disposition perspective? Just as you think about this net funding, I think you've been a little bit more excited on the acquisition front, and I'm just trying to better understand how much more disposition activity could you generate in the portfolio today to match that excitement, David, that you have in finding these assets in affluent suburbs?
Conor Fenerty: Hey Michael, it's Conor. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to David on the acquisition side. On the disposition side, a few things. As you know, we've always recycled capital, whether it's one to two wholly-owned properties per year and that generally has been about $25 million to $50 million of wholly-owned assets per year. And I don't think 2022 would be any different in that regard. The other piece and we talked about this last quarter with everyone in with you is on the JV side, where we got the SAU portfolio, which we announced closed at subsequent to quarter end. And obviously, some of our other partners are nearing debt maturities, which is a natural time for them to consider their long-term plans for their joint ventures as well. So, you'll likely see some joint -- additional joint venture properties sold on top of SAU. In terms of kind of the impact in guidance, it's really not really a mover for the year. It's probably half basis -- or excuse me, $0.05 in terms of a headwind just from some of the JV assets, but I'll let David expand on the acquisition side as well.
David Lukes: Yes, Michael, I would say that our confidence level in what we're seeing of assets that we would like to acquire is growing. I would shy away from trying to guide as to what the volume might be simply because we're most interested in this high rent growth convenience-oriented properties because they're responding best to a lot of the societal shifts that I think have taken place coming out of the pandemic. But the thing to remember is that most of the sellers are private sellers. A lot of them are 1031 sellers. It takes a lot of time to transact with them. And I do think that with rates rising, those types of owners are being incentivized to sell sooner rather than later. So I think John and I are pretty hopeful that the pipeline continues to grow things that we want to buy.
Michael Bilerman: And then, how do you balance, obviously, the asset sale proceeds you can sort of get market. But on the equity, you're obviously beholden to the market and given the fact that your leverage levels are in check and the stock obviously has been volatile and is, getting closer to NAV now than where it was earlier in the year. But how do you sort of balance, sort of goes to Richard's question a little bit, how you grow from here, from a capital perspective if the market is not willing to afford you the cost of capital to do it either on the debt side where rates have moved up or on the equity side where the stock still trades at a meaningful discount to NAV?
Conor Fenerty: Yeah, Michael, to your words, it's still your words, its balance. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. Look, we've got I think, a pretty good five-year track record for us of balancing debt equity sources uses. And then, I'm not trying to be evasive, but I mean that's what we'll do going forward. We do have a lot of retained cash flow. We do have some assets that are durable in nature and well leased, but still very attractive that we could recycle. We'll have more to disclose on that front to David's point of dispositions and acquisitions in the next three months. The other point is if you look at kind of the range of dollar values of what we bought, 90, so far has been the largest and $4 million is the smallest. That does make it a little bit easier. These aren't all $300 million properties. And so, the vast majority to kind of blend or look at a weighted average and closer to, call it, $25 million to $40 million, that does admittedly make it a lot easier to kind of achieve the balance that you referenced.
Michael Bilerman: The second topic is just on sort of frequency of visits and hybrid work environment and inflation. Just tying it all together, David, in your conversations with your retail tenants and you can go across the spectrum. Can you just share a little bit about what the data -- your data is telling to you, what the retailer's data is telling you more recently in terms of number of trips that people are taking to your centers, maybe average spend and weather inflation is impacting that at all, either from the retailer perspective and being able to be open or conversely, your ability to drive things?
David Lukes: Yeah. Well, let me talk about the two aspects of data that we do have is factual data. One would be customer visit, frequency and duration, right? That comes from the geolocation data.
Michael Bilerman: Yeah.
David Lukes: And the other piece of data that I think is really interesting is, we've done so many box leases in the last 12 months that when the tenant goes in for a building permit, we can pull their plans and see what the layout of the store looks like. And so those are two different pieces of information. And what they're telling us is that the customer visits to our properties are up from pre-pandemic call it, 10% to 15%. And that moves around a bit, because the denominator with only 92 properties it's not large. But in general, I think we're up around 10% to 15%. What's more interesting, Michael is that the duration, the amount of time that a customer spends on the property is actually down 10%. And -- and part of the -- and I think the reason that we're seeing that is the impact of last-mile fulfillment. And so let me tie that over to what we've seen in the tenant exhibit when they go in for building permits. There's no question that, that demising wall between front of house and back of house has moved since pre-pandemic. And it's moving to the shrinkage of the front of house, which we get a customer space and it's growing in the back of house, which would be sorting and distribution. So, I think, as we put some data together, we'll try and get something a little bit more robust for NAREIT. I think it's a pretty compelling story that the customer visits are more frequent, but shorter. And the reason, of course, is that most of our retailers are starting to use their footprint as last-mile fulfillment, which might explain why there's been so much anchor leasing in the last 12 months.
Michael Bilerman: Right. I guess, the worry is that, in some ways, you'd want some of them stay there longer to increase spend across retailers, right? The dwell time is obviously an important factor in driving aggregate sales and obviously rent.
David Lukes: I don't -- I think that's part of the big question is, how much does cross-shopping dictate profitability. I think, that's the real issue. So a lot of this comes down to basket size and so forth. What we do know is that the tenant balance sheets are in a lot better shape than they were before. I feel pretty good about EBITDA margins, four-wall EBITDA. And the retailers seem very specific about how many doors they have, what access they have to trucking. And so, I think that whole ecosystem has changed a little bit, but it's definitely making me feel more confident than less confidence going forward.
Michael Bilerman: All right. Appreciate the time.
David Lukes: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: The next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on investments. Conor, you talked about potential joint venture asset sales as part of the capital plan for the remainder of the year. And I was just wondering, if you can provide, or David, if you can provide an update and status of the remaining 23 assets in the Madison joint venture, which you discussed a bit last quarter and were reported to be on the market. Is there any update you can provide there on timing and institutional demand for those assets and whether future investments would be predicated on the wind-down and monetization of that venture?
Conor Fenerty: Yes. Todd, I would just say, as you know, we discussed sales and they close, and you're right, there have been some reports on potential asset sales. And again, to our point, from our comments last quarter and this quarter, debt maturities are a natural time for joint ventures to kind of choose their path or choose the direction. Obviously, for us, it led to some acquisitions in the fourth quarter and the first quarter from that joint venture, and it could lead to some dispositions for the course of the year. But, as you know, just given our policy, we'll talk about things as they close. But you're right to assume that that's a potential source of equity for us. And I don't know, if I answered all your questions, but I'm trying to think if I did.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And David, you talked about the 9% IRR at Casselberry and the five-year IRR at Boca Center. That was greater than 7%. What's the initial yield or year one yield look like on average for the assets that you acquired in the quarter? Just trying to get a sense and sort of bridge the NOI growth from acquisition during the course of the whole period.
David Lukes: Sure. Well, the assets we purchased this quarter, the going in cap rate averaged to 5.1% and the five-year CAGR was 7%.
Conor Fenerty: And, Todd, those are the five-year CAGRs we quoted, not the unlevered IRRs.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Got it. All right, makes sense. And then, David, you sound confident about the growth that you're seeing in assets that you're targeting for acquisition. But are you changing your return hurdles at all in the current environment or the way that you're underwriting future investments as you look ahead?
David Lukes: Yes. I mean, I think, that as we're starting to see more things come to market, I think some of the sellers and the brokers out there are starting to realize what we're looking for. We're just being pretty selective. So we're certainly not going down in our unlevered IRR expectations and given where rates are going, I'd like to see them move up a little bit.
Todd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.
David Lukes: I mean, Todd, the real issue is that to generate the types of unlevered IRRs that we expect, you can really only do it in two ways, either through occupancy or rent growth. And occupancy is not easy to find. But at Boca, there were a couple of suites that were vacant that had active deals, so we're getting a lot of growth from shop leasing with a couple of spaces. But the other way to achieve that growth is through the turnover in the rents. And what's interesting about Shops at Boca, you think about putting $90 million to work at a property that's got an average base rent of about $38 a square foot. And a couple of miles away, in Miami, we're signing leases at $70 to $80 a foot. So, that's really where we're generating a lot of the growth is from the rising rents and a little bit of occupancy. And we'll be pretty picky about finding things that fit those hurdles, so that we don't get stuck in a situation where we've got a low-growth asset and that's what's going to put pressure on unlevered IRRs going down.
Todd Thomas: All right. Great, thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good morning, good morning. Just two questions. First, following-up on the pricing and the markets out there, certainly seeing exposure in the non-traded REITs, and they pretty much look to be heavy cash buyers. So David, I was a little interested that you were saying that some of the competition you see is from levered buyers, because in speaking to some brokers and other just seeing the fund flows, it seems like it's a lot of heavy cash buyers. But more importantly, if you guys are buying sort of at a low-5, your stock is sort of trading north of 7%. Obviously, kudos to you to find deals. But at the same time, what do you think the public markets are missing as far as the story of retail rebound, because the headlines have certainly been good. Last week, online sales were down, physical in-store sales were double-digit positive. So the benefit of retail is well known, but yet there's just persistent disconnect, and that's at odds with the results that you guys are showing, with the cap rates where assets are trading and certainly where the private money is going. So, what do you think is missing as far as closing that gap? And is it just a matter of -- the public market just has a view that is at odds or are you guys confident that, that gap can be closed and the value realized in the public format?
David Lukes: Well, I would -- I'll try -- good morning, Alex. I'll try and not speak for the entire public market. But, I think when I -- when we meet with investors, the number one topic that I think there's a misconception is the long-term CapEx required to run this business with the trends that have changed coming out of COVID. And I do think companies like ourselves, are still burning through a lot of leasing CapEx. I mean, it's significant for the next year. And the reason is that there's a lot of occupancy uplift. But given inflation in rents, the ability for tenants to pass on a lot of cost to consumers, the lack of new supply, the difficulty in getting entitlements in wealthy suburbs, the cost of replacement. So, if you want to build a new shopping center has gone so high, I think that there's going to be scarcity of space in the future. So in my mind, the big change, pre-COVID versus post- COVID is that retention rates are going to be higher and CapEx is going to go much lower than it was historically. And that does, as you know, have a huge impact on IRR. So when we're competing against other buyers in the private world, I think they're more accurately underwriting CapEx in the future, and that helps them get more aggressive on pricing. And that is one of the differences, I think between public and private buyers is the expectation of CapEx.
Conor Fenerty: And Alex, to your point, I mean, to David's response earlier on the leverage unlevered question, I mean there's still, to your point, a number of unlevered buyers out there. So I think David is referencing simply the levered buyers are changing their underwriting. But to your point, there are no shortage of unlevered buyers.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then to be a classic analyst, we have to ask it on the flip side. There's a lot of – you guys speak about growth coming from leasing and the signed, but not yet commenced. And yet in reality, it takes a long time for occupancy to build, especially your sort of at 90-ish in place versus your expectation of exceeding the prior high watermark. So are we, as the analysts too optimistic about the pace seeing that occupancy grow and that this really takes many years, or is it your view that there's going to be the sudden acceleration that's going to get us to that sort of normalized occupancy a lot sooner than historically would be expected?
Conor Fenerty: Hey, Alex, it's Conor. I would just say, we lay out on page 7 of our slides, the commencement schedule. And you can see and in my comments, I think I said 60% of those leases commenced by year-end. They happen to be pretty back-end loaded, just the windows that retailers like to open. But I mean, we're forecasting effectively 60% of our SNO pipeline, which is 6% of our base rent to open this year. So you're absolutely right. It's taken a while to kind of build this, but we are forecasting pretty significant base rent growth starting in the fourth quarter and into 2023 and 2024. Was also fascinating if you look at the SNO pipeline, we're signing leases with 2023 and 2024 openings, right? It kind of speaks to David's scarcity point. But to answer your question directly it's a this year event. If you recall, Tammi asked the question last quarter about kind of base rent, the base rent build over the course of the year. If you look at our same-store NOI base rent – same-store base rent, excuse me, this quarter is about plus 2.5%. We expect that to build over the course of the year, which speaks to your question of kind of when these leases come online.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.
Conor Fenerty: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Samir Khanal with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Good morning, everybody. I guess, David, maybe on the 600,000 square feet of leasing that's under negotiation, maybe talk around who are the tenants that are active in that space from a demand perspective? And what changes have you seen, if any, from a negotiation standpoint, whether it's terms pricing given the increased volatility from a macro standpoint versus maybe three to six months ago?
David Lukes: Sure, Samir. The pipeline of leases looks strikingly similar to the last few quarters, meaning there's a lot of chunky leases with boxes, they tend to be discounters. The pOpshelf, the Burlington, the TJ concepts, The Ross, a lot of discount activity going into these wealthy suburbs. And then there's a component, which I would say is service-oriented. We're still seeing a lot of demand coming from health and wellness, a lot of dentists and doctors and chiropractors and urgent care and so forth coming out of the urban areas and kind of chasing their customers into the suburban areas. And then the last piece of it is kind of a more recent growing shop demand. And there is a lot of new concepts, healthy concepts, particularly on the restaurant side. There's been a number of new IPOs in the past year that are in growth mode. So I would say, it's probably half to two-thirds larger discount boxes, and then you kind of get into the health and wellness and some of the small shop tenants. It's not very dissimilar from what you've seen in the last couple of quarters. The real question is what's going to happen towards the end of the year because we're running pretty low on box inventory. And I think that's one of the changes you'll see towards the end of this year is that will effectively be running out of boxes to lease. And so that's when you'll see us really have a lot more of the deal flow coming from the shops.
Samir Khanal: Thank you for that. And I guess, just curious on the convenience properties that you've highlighted, how should we think about the NOI growth of those centers? I mean, there's about 30% of leases that expire with that action. So what's the upside of rent that you think you can get maybe the mark-to-market opportunities there?
David Lukes: Well, it depends on the property, but I'm going to give you an example. In shops at Boca, I think, the mark-to-market is probably close to 50%. The question is how much of it can you capture. But with an ABR of $38 in place and leases in the remainder of our portfolio in South Florida and the kind of 40 50, 60, 70 range, the scarcity value is definitely causing a lot of rent growth. And that's one of the main theses behind convenience or an properties is that the number of tenants seeking a simple 30x90-foot wide space is very large. And so whenever you get the opportunity to renew a tenant who's naked with no options, the CapEx required for a renewal of zero and the CapEx required to replace a shop tenant is pretty low. So I think that a lot of that growth from that subsector is really coming from just general market rent growth and then a lack of CapEx required to buy that growth.
Samir Khanal: Thank you, David.
David Lukes: Thanks, Samir.
Operator: The next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. 
Mike Mueller: Yes. Hi. Conor, I think you said the bottom end of the guidance range doesn't include any reversals or prior period collections, I think, you got that right. But what's baked in there in the top end of the range?
Conor Fenerty: Yes. It's consistent with last quarter, Mike. It's still another $0.01. So effectively, if we have another $2 million reversals that would be the top end of the range. But in terms of what's on the balance sheet, we've got $13 million of AR, about half of that was reserved, so call it 6.57 and about half of that reserve, excuse me, is related to cash basis deferrals. So there's called another $3 million, $3.5 million of deferrals outstanding that we've had a 99% repayment rate to-date on deals it is a potential source of upside, but I would just give my usual caveat that it's reserved for a reason.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Got it. And obviously, a lot of talk about acquisitions and pricing and stuff. But your redevelopment pipeline looks like it's about $60 million to $70 million. And I guess, as you look out over the next few years, how do you see the aggregate size of that pipeline either changing or staying the same?
David Lukes: I think that -- this is Dave, Mike. Redevelopment can come from kind of defensive where you need to change the shape and the layout of a property to match current demand or it can come from densification, where you're trying to add square footage, whether it's in retail or whether it's another asset class. It sure feels like the rent growth coming out of the COVID years has basically made the numbers far more compelling to lease existing space. So I think in our portfolio, the scarcity value is making rents go up to the point that I don't see our redevelopment pipeline growing from here. I think we're really focused much more on just simple rent growth.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Okay.
David Lukes: That said differently, Mike. Sometimes what I say to myself is this business seems to have gone from a redevelopment business to a renewal business. And the renewals business is a lot easier to manage, and I'm actually looking forward to the next couple of years because being a renewals business is just a great position to be in, and I hope it lasts for a number of years.
Mike Mueller: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks, Mike.
Operator: The next question comes from Floris van Dijkum with Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris van Dijkum: Morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on something that Michael Bilerman asked, and you mentioned something, David, about the dwell time being 10% down, while the visits were up. Is that to individual stores, or is that to your center?
David Lukes : It's to the overall property.
Floris van Dijkum: Okay. So that -- so you're capturing essentially the -- all of the tenants at the center. I just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly.
David Lukes : Yes. Correct. Correct. So I think -- I mean, Floris, if you just think anecdotally, and we're definitely working through the data, there's two input assumptions to remember, one is every time you're working from home and you order Uber Eats for lunch, somebody goes to our shopping center and is there for a whopping three minutes, and that counts as a visit. Another example would be you're working remotely three days a week. And instead of doing five airings on a Saturday, now you're doing two airings for three days in a row. And that's why I think that the tenants have figured out that proximity to the high income customers is what's generating the most trip generation, and that's where they're getting the sales. So for me, I think it has everything to do with proximity in last-mile fulfillment, and that's really why we're seeing the dwell time be a little bit lower.
Floris van Dijkum: Got it. That makes sense. The -- another question for you guys, in terms of Florida, you counted the fact that you're over -- just over 20% of value in Florida now. I mean, do you have like a target that you want to see in Florida? Do you think that can go to 30%, or -- and what other sort of -- I saw that you're in Tallahassee now, but just one asset. Is that a market that you expect to get greater scale in?
David Lukes : Well, I think part of the migration of our value is simply because we've had a couple of large joint ventures that were in kind of middle market communities that have gone away. And so the remaining portfolio has become more concentrated in our top 12 submarkets. So we don't have a numeric target for the state of Florida or for really any other region. We're pretty happy with our top dozen markets. And you've seen us start buying assets in those markets, including Arizona, but some of our other markets, too, like Boston and D.C. and Atlanta. When we find things we like, I think, we're going to go after those properties in our existing markets. I don't see us going to new markets. The Tallahassee property came in a small portfolio we bought from our partner. But I think we're finding specific property reasons to buy as opposed to a submarket reason.
Conor Fenerty : Yes. And Floris, just on the point on metros, I think, it's 90% of our base rent or value in Orlando and Miami. So that's -- it's really those two markets with additional assets in Tampa, Naples and to your point, one property outside of those MSAs.
Floris van Dijkum: Great. And then maybe last, just talk a little bit about -- more about the convenience focus that you guys have. I mean it's -- I mean, I think about it sort of the size of the asset is sort of like a typical PECO grocery-anchored centers, $20 million to $25 million, $30 million or something like that, if they're relatively small, lower CapEx, as you say, more upside in terms of marking rents to market. How should I compare that, or how should investors compare that to street retail where, again, you've got -- again, higher value per square, but typically, the beauty about traditional urban street play is that, again, more cracks to reset rents to market lower CapEx. Would that be an extension to your investment focus, or is that -- are you guys happy being focusing on the convenience because it's such a big potential market anyway?
David Lukes: I think what's interesting, Floris, is -- look at the two categories, street retail and convenience retail and you named a similarity, which is a little bit shorter duration, fewer options, and therefore, easier to capture mark-to-market and in general, lower CapEx because it's more of a renewals business, both for convenience and for street. The major difference between the two to me is significant and that is that street retail is generally pedestrian and convenience retail is convenience with the automobile. And with the changes in the pandemic and the cultural shift to hybrid work, which I think is long-standing, I do feel like investing around the macro theme of wealthy suburban communities with auto-centric trip generation is just a superior thesis. So, I do not see us moving out of convenience-oriented into street retail because I just think that the customer demand is going to drive higher rents. And in these communities, it's very difficult to entitle additional square footage. Construction cost is going up, which means for anybody to build competing supply, would have to charge more rent. So, I think there's a lot of favorable tailwinds to it.
Conor Fenerty: Yes, the only thing I'd add to that is fee ownership versus a condo, right? We own the land versus typically, it's a condo ownership and obviously, there's a difference there as well.
Floris van Dijkum: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate the answers.
David Lukes: Thanks Floris.
Operator: The next question comes from Paulina Rojas Schmidt from Green Street. Please go ahead.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Good morning. You reported strong list, so obviously, there is still significant -- what are you hearing from retailers? Is there any change in -- are they -- or are you concerned at all about the higher inflation, higher interest rate environment, and a potential drop in consumer spending.
David Lukes: Good morning Paulina, those are great questions. I mean we hear anecdotal information from the retailers. I would say that their primary concern in the past 12 months has been to get into the locations and the communities they want to get into. So, finding space was probably most top of mind. The second kind of conversations we've had with them has a lot to do with finding staff. I think labor is sometimes not talked about as frequently as inflation for products, but I think labor inflation is a real issue for the retailers and I think it's part of the reason we've been focusing on national credit tenants because the larger tenants that have 401(k)s and they have dental and medical programs, they're able to hire staff. And that's why I think you're starting to see a lot of the national credit get tenancies signed, get leases signed and get open because they can hire the staff in order to occupy and staff those stores. Going forward, I think inflation is on everybody's mind and certainly on the minds of retailers. A number of our tenants are discount-oriented and so I think they feel like when inflationary environment occur, when the next recession comes, what normally happens is high-income consumers start to acquire more discount goods. And so I think the discounters want to be in those submarkets where they're going to capture some of that high-end consumer coming down market a little bit.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Thank you. And then how do you commence occupancy change sequential on a, sort of, same property basis? You think, you don't see a decline, but I'm not sure this is a clean more or less in property figure?
David Lukes: Paulina, I'm happy to discuss offline. So I mean our same-store commence is 90.2% in terms of what changed. The only significant pool change I can think of is we added Casselberry Commons, because we acquired it this quarter. But I can come back to you. I mean, I can't think of anything that was material that would impact the sequential change in the same-store commenced rate.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Okay. So then there was a question to time…
David Lukes: Paulina, actually, sorry, just to clarify, that same-store commence is including redevelopment. The number you're probably referencing was excluding redevelopment. But I can get you the apples-to-apples number, if you'd like offline.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Okay. Thank you. And then the last one. I think you mentioned you had been successful in getting tenants open ahead of schedule. Is that the main driver behind the same property guidance increase?
David Lukes: No, it's a little bit of everything. Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry to cut you off. It's a little bit of everything, you're right. For this quarter, the benefit to same-store NOI was in part due to earlier rent commencements. We also, I referenced had higher retention, less fallout this quarter. That has an impact over the course of the year. I think that far outweighed the kind of one-time benefit of a month or two here or there from an anchor opening. But both are impactful and material to us, but the far bigger impact was the full year numbers was greater retention and greater mark-to-market, those factors as opposed to rent commencements. We could have more upside over the course of the year from rent commencements. I mentioned as one of the swing factors for the year. That's one of the big three. But TBD on that front, we've had a great track record, kudos to our operations team, but there's nothing else built in on that front, but it could be a source of upside.
Paulina Rojas Schmidt: Thank you. That’s all from me.
Operator: The next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. So just going back to your acquisition. The cost base for this quarter was about $550 a square foot. And thanks for all the information on yields and CAGR. But what does this translate to better your knowledge in terms of occupancy costs? And if you get that 7% CAGR over time, what does that mean for year five occupancy costs in your underwriting?
David Lukes: Ki Bin, it's a very good question. It's so dependent on who's the tenant. So we've got Charles Schwab that came with the Scottsdale property. We've got restaurants doing $1,000 a foot in Boca. So it really, really depends on the tenancy. And when we acquire them, we do go through their occupancy cost to figure out who's at risk and who can handle more rent growth. So when we're turning properties away that we don't want to buy, it's usually exactly what you're saying. The rents may look good from a market perspective, but the tenant roster can't handle more bumps. So we're trying to find the properties where the tenants are generating enough top line sales that they can afford to get to market, which is arguably a lot higher than in-place.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. And you mentioned the 5.1 going in yield and a five-year CAGR of 7%, which is, call it, 12% low, 12% unlevered IRR. It seems like with those kind of economics, capital would be all over that type of acquisition. So there's a couple of questions. Is it the way you acquired it? Is it a different set of underwriting that led you to be the winner on this type of deal? If you can just, kind of, provide some color around that?
David Lukes: I think it's only a matter of time before a lot more capital starts chasing similar type of properties. The reality is, when institutional or private capital allocates to an investment thesis, a lot of it is around who the anchor is and what that anchor does. And I think what's changed for us is that, the geolocation data that all landlords have access to now does kind of free you from having to go to a specific anchor and it allows you to go into unanchored or convenience-oriented properties. And so, I do think that having that data allows us to be a lot more nuanced about our acquisitions. And we are competing against a lot of other buyers. It's just that we're kind of willing to really work hard to source some of these smaller deals. And that is one of the challenges of this thesis is that the deal size does tend to be a little bit smaller. And so, it just takes a lot of legwork to get the deal pipeline built.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of your earlier comments just now about going into convenience-oriented properties, because of geolocational data, you don't need an anchor. What would be, like, the mix of certain retailers that you would require in order to do this?
David Lukes: Well, we still, kind of, like -- we still like credit. I mean, I think in the next downturn, we're going to be happiest with buying credit. So you've seen everything we've bought. There's a lot of financial institutions, but we can measure their deposits. There's a lot of high-end credit restaurants. There’re a lot of Starbucks. There's a lot of Verizons, Wells Fargo, Chase, Schwab, et cetera, JPMorgan. So we are getting a lot of credit. I think that the non-credit tenants that we like to see tend to be service users or restaurants that have proven sale.
Conor Fenerty: When you think about the kind of common denominators of the existing portfolio, there's three factors: credit to David's point, our national tenants are 89% of base rent. The second is market. We generally have invested in markets that we already know or have existing assets. And the third is income. I mean, those are three pretty powerful filters that, to David's point, remove a lot of the investment subsets. So, again, you'll see the kind of -- as David mentioned in his forward-look comments, the common attributes are the market, the incomes and the credit, and that's what we're kind of investing around.
Linda Tsai: That makes sense. And then, last quarter, you talked about a 200 basis point increase in occupancy from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023. Do you think it could be higher than that?
Conor Fenerty: No, I think it's fair. I mean, to kind of Paulina's question, could we have -- or we do now have higher occupancy over the course of the year? Yes. But I still think the build and growth is very similar. If you look at our SNO pipeline, it's generally unchanged. It's just maybe you have a little earlier commencement here or there, or a higher kind of initial starting point. But it should, I think, generally kind of move higher over the course of the year, call that, 100 to 200 basis point level. Could we pull forward some potential commencements from 2023 into 2022? Yes, but we're not ready to kind of estimate or budget that yet.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And last question, just the $3.5 million of potential source of upside from reserve tenants. Do you have any of that that could potentially benefit 2023 earnings?
Conor Fenerty: No. I think to Mike's question, we've got about, at the top end of the range, $2 million of potential reserve reversals that would include either just reserves we have in general or that can include the cash basis deferrals that I referenced. Just know that, as we get longer in this kind of collection cycle, the probability of collection drops, right? Additionally, if you think about a deferral we made with the tenant that implied a 2022 or 2023 and 2024 repayment, means that they probably had a higher level of stress during COVID as well. So, you're right, there's potential source of upside. I would just caution folks that, it doesn't mean we have $3.5 million in the bag. One is spread out over a couple of years and two, these are tenants that needed a longer-dated deferral for a reason.
Q – Linda Tsai: Thank you. 
David Lukes: You’re welcome.
Operator:  The next question comes from Tammi Fique with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. 
Tammi Fique: Good morning. Just maybe following up on the convenience-oriented acquisitions. I'm just wondering, is the focus there geographically around existing assets? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for the operating efficiencies of those smaller assets as well as your appetite for expansion into additional markets?
David Lukes: It's Tammi, I would say it's definitely within submarkets where we own existing properties and that's really for two reasons. One, as you mentioned from an operating efficiency standpoint, if we have property management and leasing covering that market anyway, it's kind of a way to scale G&A without having to increase staff. And the second is market information. If we're doing recent deals in Arizona and we see recent shop leases at $60 a foot and then we see a property for sale a mile away that's in the $30, that tells us something. So, I think the market intelligence is kind of equally as important as the G&A scale.
Tammi Fique: Okay. Thank you. And then can you just provide us some perspective on changes in the lending environment on both the secured and unsecured side? And how you're thinking about the term two maturities in terms of repayment or refinancing?
Conor Fenerty: Sure. Hey Tammi, it's Conor. Look, I mean to say that the lending market is volatile, is probably understatement. Our all-in rate or coupon on a bond deal could change it feels like 20 basis points in a day. So, look thankfully, we've got access to a wide variety of sources and some great banking partnerships. So, whether the term loan market, the unsecured bond market or the mortgage market, all are open today. But to your kind of genesis of your question, it's -- all-in rates are up between 75 and 150 basis points, depending on which market I just referenced.  So again, we thankfully got a very wide variety of sources, as I mentioned, between the kind of big three. And given our balance sheet, there's nothing needed right now. But you're right, with ’23, ’24, ’25 there's some sort of capital markets activity necessary in the next call it, 9 to 18 months that will take advantage of one of those three buckets. But it's, again, volatile is an understatement. And pricing is definitely out, call it round numbers 100 basis points in the last four months.
Tammi Fique: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Conor Fenerty: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
Q – Haendel St. Juste: Hey there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to ask you about the preferred, I think coming due in June 6, and a quarter. Curious, given the change in your cost of capital, how are you thinking about redeeming that in terms of sourcing. So, any comments on that would be appreciated? Thanks.
Conor Fenerty: Sure. Hey good morning Haendel, it's Conor. So, you're right, they're prepayable at par in June of this year. As you know, there's no maturity on that. So it depends on kind of our cost of capital at time. And if you want to do anything, the night part is we don't have to do anything, given the moving rates, they're potentially even more attractive today than they were four months ago. But if we have a use of capital and that is the best use to take those out and we'll do so. But at this time, excuse me, there's no plan to do anything and we're excited about the perpetual nature of that piece of paper.
Q – Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Thanks. I think I heard you mention that there's still within the guidance, some recapture of prior period rents, I guess, can you quantify what's in the upper end of the guidance range? And then overall, what the remaining opportunity that's left here and if any of that is carried over into 2023? Thanks.
David Lukes: Yeah. So just at the top end, it's about $0.10. So it's $2 million of potential reserve reversals and that could be in the form of COVID deferral repayments or excuse me, cash basis deferral repayments or just other reserves we have on the balance sheet. So that could occur over the course of the year, to be pro-rata on the course of the year, it's kind of a TBD. There could be to my earlier response, additional reserve reversals in 2023 and 2024. We'll see, I would just again reiterate my point as we get further away from 2020 and those deferral agreements, the risk grows, right? And so they're reserved for a reason. So again, it's $0.01 in 2022. Could there be additional upside in 2023 and 2024? Absolutely. But again, I just – I wouldn't bank on it as of today.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then last one, just curious, maybe a comment earlier heard us a couple of times that you continuing to get your stores ahead of schedule, which helped you a little bit the quarter. But I guess I'm curious what maybe some of the secret soft there is in hearing some of the challenges with the labor shortage of supply chain issues. How have you been able to get the stores open? And is that something that you anticipate, you'll continue to be able to do into the back half of the year? Thanks.
David Lukes: Well, one input to that handle, is that when we budget for store openings, we budget for the last possible date that they're allowed to open in the lease. And it just so happens with tenant sales the way they've been the tenants are trying desperately to get open earlier. So they're certainly part of the assistance on that. The second is that, we're a large enough company with a dedicated construction staff that is sourcing some of the long lead items like installation and roofing materials and MEP units. They're just sourcing those long lead items when the lease gets signed as opposed to when they pull the building permits. So they've done a great job of getting the materials that we need. The challenge has been turning into labor. I think that's the issue. So going forward, I think we're certainly not banking on earlier rent commencements going forward simply because labor seems to be getting more and more difficult to find, particularly on the skilled side.
Haendel St. Juste: Thanks, again. Well, thank you, guys. Appreciate the comments.
David Lukes: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you all for taking the time. We'll talk to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
56,SITC,2,2022,2022-07-28 14:57:04,"Operator: Good day, and welcome to the SITE Centers' reports Second Quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Monica Kukreja, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead maâam.
Monica Kukreja: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to SITE Centersâ second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and a slide presentation on to our website at www.sitecenters.com which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today's call. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, on todayâs call, including FFO, operating FFO and same-store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in todayâs quarterly financial supplement. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Good morning. And thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. We had a very productive second quarter with results well ahead of budget. Leasing demand continued to be very strong from both existing retailers and service tenants expanding into key suburban markets along with new concepts competing for the same space. The strength of execution from our leasing team resulted in a 120 basis point sequential increase of our portfolio lease rate. Additionally, we completed significant capital recycling as we continue to invest in our convenience thesis. And lastly, we closed a couple of key financings in the last few months, improving duration, while keeping the balance sheet in great shape with debt-to-EBITDA the low fives at quarter end, which remains well ahead of the peer group and the sector overall. I'll start this morning discussing second quarter results, talk briefly about leasing and then discuss our investments and transaction activity, which adds to our portfolio of assets in wealthy suburban communities. As I mentioned, second quarter OFFO was ahead of our budget primarily on better operations, which Conor will provide more detail on later. Our property operations team continued to do a great job, getting tenants open for business ahead of schedule, which drove part of our performance this quarter and our improved guidance. Moving to leasing tenant demand and activity remained elevated across the portfolio and we built upon our momentum over the last two years with another quarter of record volume relative to the last six years. There were no shortage of key deals this quarter, including the recapture and retenanting of a ground leased restaurant in LA, the releasing of all four available units, including two anchors at one of our shopping centers in Charlotte at a positive 128% mark-to-market, multiple first to portfolio shop deals across a number of different assets and continued progress on the lease up of our tactical redevelopment pipeline. The volume and the quality of our leasing is a true testament to our people, our processes, and the quality of our focused portfolio of real estate in key suburban submarkets. Looking forward, we have another 250,000 square feet at share in lease negotiations, which we expect to be completed by year end with similar characteristics to the deals we've signed since the pandemic began, with a concentration on national, publicly traded, credit tenants. We continue to expect the commencement of our signed leases to be the material driver of our growth over the next several years. Shifting to transaction activity with a very active last four months, recycling capital highlighted by the sale of Lennox Town Center and the Madison Pool A portfolio for a combined $464 million. Net proceeds along with balance sheet capacity were reinvested in the convenience assets in Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, and Washington DC. We are really pleased with the execution on both of these deals and the ability to reallocate capital in the convenience properties. The largest investment this quarter was the acquisition of two properties in Lafayette, California, which is a submarket I know well from my time living in the Bay Area. Lafayette Mercantile and La Fiesta Square offer all of the attributes that we are targeting in convenience properties, including barriers to entry, excellent demographics with trade area household incomes of $223,000 and average home prices of over $2 million, convenient access and parking and site plans that offer a mix of simple, liquid, lease shops to a wide variety of national regionals and local tenants, including Starbucks, Bluemercury, and FedEx. While the Bay Area has had no shortage of headlines around CBD office utilization rates and our property data highlights the benefits of dominant suburban convenience properties, customer traffic at these newly acquired properties are running ahead of comparable 2019 periods between 5% and 15%. With lease up and mark-to-market the Lafayette assets have an underwritten five-year NOI CAGR of almost 4% with limited CapEx providing compelling capital adjusted growth. In the Washington D.C. Metro, we bought a three-property convenience portfolio with average incomes of over $150,000 and a tenant roster leased largely to a mix of national service and QSR users. These properties are located just two miles from our own Fairfax Towne Center asset, providing us excellent visibility on market rents and tenant prospects. And moving to Atlanta, we bought two more convenience properties in our largest market and our confident we can find more opportunities to grow our portfolio in this key MSA, given our presence on the ground. Going forward, we remain encouraged by our investments in convenience properties and this compelling subsector in open air shopping center remains a key area of focus for the company. We've assembled a portfolio of 20 properties now with an average household income of $145,000, and weighted average TAP scores of 87 and an underwritten five-year NOI CAGR of almost 4% with minimal CapEx. Each of these properties all located in key markets for the company including Miami, Scottsdale, D.C., San Francisco and Atlanta will be drivers of the company's long-term growth. Our transactions department led by John Cattonar has done a fantastic job building local relationships within our core markets such that we're able to source and select the right opportunities for us to acquire. The convenience sub-sector is clearly benefiting from recent societal shifts favoring hybrid work and our property data aggregated over the past few years is showing a distinct rise in customer traffic. The recent rise in construction costs is also creating scarcity in this retail format as new construction is low even in the face of rising market rents. The addressable market in this convenient sub-sector is quite large and we look forward to continuing our progress of deploying capital into this growth sector. Thank you to the entire SITE Centers team for an excellent first half of the year. We've been hard at work for some time repositioning the company to outperform and remain excited about our focus portfolio. And with that I'll turn it over to Conor.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks David. I'll comment first on quarterly results, discuss our revised 2022 guidance and some of the moving pieces heading into the third quarter and then conclude with the balance sheet. Second quarter results were ahead of plan as David mentioned, due to a number of operational factors including earlier rent commencements, higher than budgeted occupancy due to higher retention rates and higher overage rent. These operational factors totaled over $0.01 per share relative to budget. The quarter also included $250,000 of unbudgeted straight line rent from the conversion of cash basis tenants and $1.2 million from payments and settlements related to prior periods. Both of these non-recurring items totaled almost another $0.01 per share relative to budget. In terms of operating metrics, the leased rate for the portfolio was up 120 basis points sequentially and 260 basis points year-over-year with our leased rate now at 94.4%. Leasing activity in the quarter was elevated across all unit sizes and our lease rate is now above this company's pre-COVID high watermark of 94.3% back in 2017. Highlighting our leasing volume and backlog, the SNO pipeline increased to $22 million from $18 million last quarter. The assigned leases now represent over 5% of annualized second quarter base rent or over 6% if you also include leases in negotiation in our pipeline. We provided an updated schedule on the expected ramp of the pipeline on Page 6 of our earning slides and expect almost 60% of the leases to commence by year-end 2022. Same store NOI was down 2.4% in the second quarter with the decline almost entirely driven by the headwind of $6.7 million of prior period reversals in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted for this same store NOI would have increased 4.8%. Moving on to our outlook. We're raising our 2022 OFFO guidance to a range of $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Rent commencements and uncollectible revenue are the largest swing factors expected to impact full year results and where we end up in the revised range. We're also raising same store on ROI guidance to a range of 3.5% to 4.75% adjusting for the roughly $14 million impact of 2021 uncollectible revenue. Details on same store NOI are in our press release and earning slides. In terms of additional assumptions for full year 2022 guidance RVI and JV fee guidance ranges remain unchanged along with our assumption for roughly flat interest expense at site share versus 2021. In terms of investments, we continue to expect net investment activity of roughly $100 million for the full year. Given year-to-date net investment activity of $136 million we are assuming fairly minimal transaction activity through year-end. For the third quarter of 2022 there were a few moving pieces to consider from the second quarter of 2022. First, as I previously mentioned we had $1.2 million of non-recurring unable revenue and $250,000 of non-recurring straight line rent in the second quarter. Second, we closed on the sale of Lennox Town Center on the last day of the second quarter and the Madison Pool A portfolio subsequent to quarter end. In addition to NOI, these assets generated, excuse me, almost $4 million in JV fees on an annual basis, which implies third quarter total JV fees of about $1.8 million. Lastly, the second quarter included $2 million of lease termination income, which is about $1.5 million higher than our trailing two-year quarterly average. A summary of these factors is on Page 9 of our earning slides. Ending with our balance sheet at quarter end leverages 5.4 times, fixed charge remained over 4 times and our unsecured debt yield was roughly 20%. In the second quarter, we recast the company's credit facility extending the maturity of the line of credit and upsized term loan to 2027. We also extended the maturing Madison debt subsequent to quarter end with the Pool A portion of the debt repaid this month with the sale of the assets. Pro forma for these financings, the company has just $87 million of unsecured debt maturing through year end 2023 and $825 million of availability on our newly recast line of credit. This capacity provides substantial liquidity and allows us to take advantage of potential future investment opportunities as they arise, and to drive sustainable growth and create stakeholder value. With that I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you.  And the first question will come from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Adam Kramer: Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So kind of wanted, looking at pretty significant portfolio activity in the quarter and it looks like it was kind of similar dollar spent on acquisitions as was generated from dispositions. So I just kind of thinking more broadly, should we kind of think about increased amount of kind of asset trades as kind of going to be a larger part of the strip business and  business going forward, recognizing that you can't â occupancy probably can't be pushed as much kind of nearing all time marks here. So just, our asset trades kind of going to be an increased part of the kind of business model going forward?
David Lukes: Hey, good morning, Adam. I think as we mentioned in the last few quarters that once we achieved our transactions budget for the year that you'd expect quite a bit of the transactions, although not all of them to be sourced from funds from dispositions. I think given the amount of leasing demand in our submarkets, it's kind of becoming obvious that some properties have a lot of growth left and that's either from renewals or from recapturing space or from occupancy uplift. And other ones are kind of fully baked in terms NOI growth, so I do think it's reasonable to assume that for us to grow the company one of the ways to do that is to sell stable assets at a really compelling price and to take that capital and recycle it into properties that we think we can move the NOI significantly through leasing and renewals.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. And Adam to answer your question, we did have a lot of activity this quarter. It was larger than, than I would say it's kind of normal. We typically have targeted selling around $50 million of wholly owned properties per year. Obviously this year was or this quarter excuse me was impacted by the joint ventures, which is a little unique and obviously not something that's able to occur â reoccur going forward. So I do think there's outside activity, but to David's point it's always been part of our business plan to recycle a handful of assets on the wholly own side each year.
Adam Kramer: Got it. That's really helpful guys, thanks. And just in terms of kind of cap rates on acquisitions and dispositions, I mean, any kind of color you can provide there and again, be it cap rates or  unlevered IRR and kind of the returns may be and how that maybe â that may be different than call it three or six months ago, how things have changed?
David Lukes: Adam, I wish I could tell you that there's been a lot of data that's come out to, let us know where cap rates have gone. I think certainly people are expecting and we're expecting that return expectations will go up as borrowing costs go up. But there just has not been that much activity. I mean, when you look at transactions that happened this quarter in the industry, it means that deals were agreed two, three, four, five months ago. So I wouldn't say it's all that current of data. From our perspective I do think that growth assets are very much favored. I mean, it is an inflation hedge if you can buy a growth asset and so I would expect that the spread between a stable asset and a growth asset â a growth asset is also widening out a little bit, but again there just hasn't that been that much data for us to point to anything yet.
Adam Kramer: That's great guys. Thanks again for the time and chat soon.
David Lukes: Thanks Adam.
Operator: The next question will come from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just first, I just wanted to follow-up, I guess, in terms of investments going forward and based on your comments, I mean, it sounds like we should expect capital recycling to continue within the whole owned portfolio. You mentioned you're seeing a lot of convenience oriented centers with strong NOI CAGRs and it sounds like that would be funded with more stabilized asset sales. Is that the right read and then if so, what's the sort of spread between I realize the difference between the cap rate and the IRRs on these assets, but what is the sort of spread delta between what you're looking to buy on the initial yield versus what you're maybe looking to sell?
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Todd, it's Conor. I would phrase it maybe a little differently and come back to my response for Adam. We traditionally sold $50 million plus or minus each quarter or each year; excuse me, from the wholly owned portfolio. I think it's fair to assume that going forward. We have the balance sheet capacity to be a net acquirer, which if you look year-to-date we're a net acquirer of $135 million and we can do so because of our leverage profile, EBITDA growth et cetera. So I don't think it's fair to assume that every dollar we spend needs to be funded with dispositions. We have leveraged capacity. Like I mentioned, we're at 5.4 times EBITDA. We have $50 million a year of free cash flow. So â and we have significant EBITDA growth given our SNO pipeline. So I think it's fair to assume we will be net acquirers if we find the opportunities, this quarter was unique in that consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, we match funded, but we don't need to match fund to grow going forward and that, that is not the expectation of this company. David, I don't know if you'd have anything to that.
David Lukes: Okay. I'm sorry, Todd, I can't recall the second part of your question. I'm sorry.
Todd Thomas: No, that's â well, I was just curious on those transactions, what the spread looks like in general in terms of the pricing between some of the convenience oriented centers and maybe the stabilized assets?
David Lukes: I think Todd, you probably â you brought it up on your question, which is for us to recycle an asset and buy a different property, one would assume that we believe that the IRR is higher. I think the going in cap rates are a little bit less relevant. But I'll also bring it back to Conor's point that it's not like we have a large stable of assets that we would like to recycle out of. I think it's been a little bit â a little bit more opportunistic. I think the spin-of RBI is what took away most of our flat assets and now we're kind of looking at a much smaller group of properties that we might recycle and we are doing so because we think the IRR can be higher on acquisitions.
Conor Fennerty: And Todd for specifics, for acquisitions I think we mentioned last quarter are going yield was about a mid-five and that's consistent with this year for kind of year-to-date for the 314 we acquired and for dispositions it was just under a 6.5 blended for the year.
Todd Thomas: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the anchor leasing, you're 97% leased and I realize that's 10,000 square feet and higher, but how much availability do you have today for larger boxes, say 35,000, 40,000 square foot plus, and curious what the demands like today from tenants for larger spaces?
David Lukes: Well, they, I mean, the challenge is the inventory is getting pretty low. We've leased 63 boxes, more than 10,000 square feet in the last 24 months. And so that tells you where the demand is. The demand is clearly on the anchor side. So sometimes I don't think it's the available boxes is as much it is as it is creating opportunities through not renewing tenants.  is sitting in the room today. She's the Vice President of Leasing in the Southeast and one of the deals this quarter that was just a stellar property is during the pandemic  was able to get control of an anchor box North of Charlotte and she released it with two subdivisions with two credit tenants. So the credit quality went up. The spreads were over 100% and the entire properties NOI went up 66% pre-COVID versus post-COVID. So that was a box that was not vacant. It was one that we were able to recapture and I think that probably is an indicator in certain submarkets what's happening with box rents. They're just significantly higher than they were pre pandemic. So the extent that you've got older tenants that are running on a term, the VPs of our various regions have the ability to recapture some of that space and find better credit tenants.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then just one last one on the net effective rent came down in the quarter on new leases. I was just wondering if that's a little bit of a mix issue in the quarter or strategically are you trying to sort of button up vacant space or re-tenant space, maybe a little bit more quickly in an effort to lock-in deals just given the, the strength you're seeing in demand and fundamentals today?
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Todd, it's Conor. It's purely a mix issue. If you look on the right hand side of that page, this is a larger percent as the GLA was signed by anchors. Obviously they're going to have a lower going in randomness net effective rent. So it purely is a denominator issue. I would expect that the trailing 12-month numbers next quarter to be consistent with the trailing 12-month numbers this quarter.
Todd Thomas: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Craig Mailman: Hey, good morning guys. I just wanted to circle back to the commentary about kind of earlier commencements helping drive 2Q results. As I was looking in the presentation, I know it's a little bit probably harder to compare quarter-to-quarter with the changes, but it looks like 3Q and 4Q commencements are definitely down relative to what was in the 1Q presentation. So I was just curious, can you guys run through how much of that benefit on a per share basis. Was in the 2Q number and how much of the guidance bump was just the result of that earlier commencement?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Craig, it's Conor. Good morning. You're absolutely right. The reason the third quarter and the fourth quarter came down is because we were able to get some tennis open. In terms of specifics, I mentioned kind of operationally â the operationally driven be it through over a penny per share, that's rent commencements along with over rent. So I don't have the exact breakdown, but my guess is probably $1 million or so, so just over a half penny. And as David mentioned, we continue to have great success, thanks to our operational team, getting tenants open earlier, which is really exciting given how challenging the supply and kind of permanent issues have been throughout the country.
Craig Mailman: Great. I think Michael has a question too.
Unidentified Analyst: Hello. Yes, just kind of a quick question. Just as we think about the convenience side and these assets are targeting, David, you talked about these opportunities with the tenants and knowing those marketplace and a lot of convenience factors that, and I think you mentioned 4% internal growth rate that you're going to see from some of these assets. How do you think about just sort of the overall size, obviously generally un-anchored smaller lots in terms of providing that future opportunity? You just talked about getting back that anchor space and splitting into two and driving that demand. How do you sort of see this portfolio that you're building up in convenience providing that long-term opportunity to do that, and does it present a risk if you're in these smaller assets that don't offer that same opportunity?
David Lukes: Okay. Well to your point, if you think about the benefits of larger properties it happens to be those kind of once in a decade chances to recycle larger box and raise the rent significantly, as you well know there's also densification opportunities with larger assets. I think what we've seen over time particularly the last 15 years or so is that getting large rent bumps out of boxes also takes a significant amount of capital, right? So if you look at the CapEx as a percentage NOI for doing a lot of tenant recycling in larger properties, it can be very expensive. And secondly, densification has been a relatively small piece of the open air puzzle, and I think that's really because the lease structures just don't allow it and entitlements and zoning are difficult. So it's not impossible, but it's not been a big driver of value. What I'm fascinated by with the un-anchored or the convenience properties is that unlike street retail where there's no surface parking, you have a large lot relative to the square footage that you're leasing and the space is tend to be a pretty ubiquitous size. There're 1,200 to 2,500 square feet on average and there's 30 or 40 tenants that'll take that space. So it just tends to be a much easier way to capture market rent growth at a capital cost that's much less than recycling, larger spaces. And so for me it has everything to do with, with hedging inflation and buying into the rent growth thesis, which is really happening because there's not that much supply growth. But doing so in a way that doesn't cost a whole lot, and so I think from an AFFO perspective, it's just superior.
Unidentified Analyst: And how should investors think about the portfolio transformation sort of three to five years out. Is there a target that you're looking at in terms of a mix of properties? Is it geographically focused? What is the ultimate goal David that you're sort of driving towards in terms of trying to build a portfolio and not just a collection of assets?
David Lukes: Yes. Well the easiest way to put it is financially. I mean, what I would love to see is our company could generate AFFO growth and I would love to say that it's in one retail format, which is convenience but we'd also have some properties that I don't ever see us selling. I mean, if you look at Midtown Miami, Michael, if you've been there, our second largest property, the rent growth there â the rent growth there is so dramatic that I think that's the type of asset that a company should hold onto forever. But it doesn't mean you can't buy that same type of growth in smaller properties in the similar submarket. So I'm a little less concerned about format but I do think you should expect over a five-year period to the question earlier, we will be selling a couple of properties, a handful every year and recycling them into something that has growth. At this point the convenience thesis seems to have the best growth at the lowest cost.
Conor Fennerty: And Michael geographically, there's no plan to kind of enter or exit new markets. I would just tell you we felt really comfortable with our Top 20, which is 86%, 87% of our base rent and value, and it's likely you'll see us concentrated on investments in those markets.
Unidentified Analyst: Helpful color guys.
David Lukes: Thanks, Michael.
Operator: The next question will come from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is  on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Hope you're all doing well. Over the last 12 months shop leasing volume was up 72% verse 19%. Can you comment on how you're underwriting tenant credit in an inflationary environment specifically for Mom-and-Pop stores? What's your target occupancy rate for the small shops?
Conor Fennerty: Thanks for the question. It's Conor here. We don't have a target occupancy. As I mentioned, we're running our lease rate is now above this portfolios kind of high watermark in 17. So there's no kind of target. We think we could be higher, but obviously to assumption in the macro environment, the inflation environment that you referenced. In terms of credit I would just point you to; I think we're 87% national. We don't have a material kind of local or Mom-and-Pop exposure. I would say even post GFC it's not that the local tenant has disappeared, but you're seeing much more kind of franchisee or national tenant growth as opposed to the kind of the Mom-and-Pops. So for us the underwriting's easy because we're doing deals with the largest quick service restaurants or largest service users in the country, which all happen to be either national credit or publicly traded, which makes the underwriting a lot easier. So again, I would kind of steer you away. It's not that we don't have local exposure, but the vast, vast majority of the small shop underwriting and small shop lease activity has been with national publicly traded QSR tenants and service tenants.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. Just one more here. How has your watch list trend recently? Are there any incremental concerns about large amounts of store closure or bankruptcies?
Conor Fennerty: No. I mean...
Unidentified Analyst: Say a quarter or two ago? Sorry.
Conor Fennerty: Yes, so I would just say, I'm sorry to cut you off there. The implicitly look if we had the benefit of straight line rent or higher straight rent from converting tenants from cash basis that implies that our watch list has shrunk quarter-over-quarter. There is obviously some names that we're worried about. And I don't think it's surprised who they be. But overall, I would say relative to pre-COVID levels and relative to last quarter, the watch list continued to shrink. And more importantly to David's point, we feel really good when we get space back that we have demand for that space today. So again, there is certainly some tenants we're all worried about. It's no surprise. But we feel really good about the fact that in our 99 assets which have average household incomes over 110,000 that will backfill those tenants would be even better and more productive tenants.
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. I appreciate the color.
Operator: The next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey good morning. Apologies, I guess it's 10:00 a.m. So two questions for you. The first is going back to  question on the small shop. And totally agree, it seems like to CapEx, the lighter CapEx and faster NOI growth of small shop unanchored is better than the big anchored dominant centers. But a question is you guys acquire, and some of these parcels that you are buying are not contiguous, it's a site across the street or down the road. So it's not necessarily all connected. Are those assets as efficient and you get the same amount of growth or is there some something that makes that center more efficient if you can get an un-anchored center, that's all literally in the same parking lot versus one that's sort of around and up and down the street? I'm just trying to get a sense that you guys look for more un-anchored infield centers.
Conor Fennerty: Yes, Alex, you mean operating efficiency from a property management cost standpoint, or do you mean efficiency in terms of dealing with tenants and rent growth and so forth?
Alexander Goldfarb: Both, I mean, there is one, the operating efficiency and then two, there is the co-tenancy right. Like everyone wants to be near the cool, whatever the cool QSRs of the day or the cool gym or the cool whatever it is, tenant. Whereas if you all have all the tenants in a row, it's much easier. You have some tenants on one side of the street, some on the other, maybe you lose some of that efficiency. So just sort of curious.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Well, one of the challenges is operations. If you buy one large property from a property management and leasing standpoint, you are focused on one asset. If you buy ten of them in the same submarket and they are all in that community, I still think you have efficiency of operations. But you've seen us acquiring things basically in markets that we already have a presence, particularly leasing in property management presence. So, I think the operations side is much easier to deal with. Buying them transactions wise, it's a lot of work. I mean, it's a laborious process for John and his team to build a portfolio, particularly if you buy some assets that are $5 million, and $10 million or $15 million at a time, and that's why you've seen us focus a little bit more on some chunkier ones like Northern California, and Delray Beach, and Boca and Atlanta where they have been $40 million to $100 million properties. With respect to leasing, and kind of tenant adjacency and wanting to be connected to each other, I do think there is â it is reasonable to say that tenants like to group together successful ones and the rents tend to be higher, but remember the longer the strip becomes the more middle space you have and if you are end caps. So sometimes what we're finding is that the end cap, particularly the drive-throughs have become so desirable from tenants that some of these smaller assets that have maybe two shops in the middle and two end caps to the drive-throughs actually have the highest rent growth. So it really comes down to a property by property underwriting.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is as you look at your shopping centers overall, and I asked this question on the Kimco call, are you seeing the same level of demand from all shoppers or is it that you are really seeing the core shoppers, if you think about the 80-20 rule, the core shoppers remaining vigilant while maybe some of the other shoppers fall off? And I'm thinking about rising fuel costs, rising credit card interest rate expense and all this other stuff that's affecting the consumer. Just trying to get a sense of if the core shoppers really what's hanging in there, or if you're seeing the total shoppers remain just as active as ever at the centers?
David Lukes: Yes. I do think that's a really interesting question. I don't know the answer. I mean that would come from specific sales data per customer that the retailers have. And as you can imagine they are not exactly sharing it. But it's a really interesting question. We have a couple of anecdotes of things that we've learned. One is that the amount of traffic that's coming to our properties and staying less than seven minutes is going up fast. And I think that's not surprising that's coming from a lot of these click-and-collect fulfillment from store and also from some of the delivery services like Uber Eats, and so forth. So it feels like who the final customer is of a product or a service is becoming a little bit more difficult to figure out, partly because there is so many easy services that are going back and forth to the properties for small durations of time. But that is resulting in a lot higher leasing demand because I do believe that the tenants have decided whether there is a recession coming or in one or not, they have decided that they have to be close and proximate to the customers. And that's really, what's driving a lot of the demand.
Alexander Goldfarb: Thank you.
David Lukes: Thanks Alex.
Operator: The next question will come from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please go ahead.
Ki Bin Kim: Thanks. Can you discuss how the mechanics of expense recoveries work in your leases in general? More specific, I'm curious usually a certain level of expenses are fully recovered and I would imagine, and at some point it will stop where inflationary cost above and beyond whatever was said, tenants is borne by the landlord. I'm not sure if that's the case, and if you just provide some more color around that,
David Lukes: Sure Ki Bin. On a general sense, our leases, our goal is a triple net lease. We don't do fixed CAM leases, we do like full pass-throughs. So if you look at a shop tenant, the recovery of expenses, CAM, insurance and taxes is a hundred percent plus administration fees to the landlord. So the recovery rate on small shop tenants tends to be somewhere between a 100% and 103%. That also follows why we're fascinated by this convenience thesis, because if recovery rates are north of a 100%, because they are paying CAM fees. The larger the tenant, the more dominant they are, the larger the square footage, the more negotiating power they have. The more there can be certain carve outs in the CAM reimbursements and that's rarely property tax or insurance, but it does sometimes mean that they have a cap on certain CAM items or they exclude certain expenses and maintenance expenses in the landlord. So when you wrap it all together, smaller tenants are a hundred percent reimbursed, the larger tenants are a little bit less than a hundred percent. And you can see that in our supplemental, when you look at our recovery rates, which hover around 85%, some of that is because of vacancy where the landlord is paying the triple nets and some of that's because of CAM caps within some of the larger national tenant leases. But to kind of come to the conclusion of your question with the net lease structure, taxes can go up, CAM can go up, it's still going to be passed through at the same recovery rate. So I don't see any issue with us maintaining our recovery rates. Unfortunately, what it does mean is that on a gross cost basis, the tenant is paying more to occupy that space. And so if there is a lot of expense recovery, just moving up with inflation, our recovery rate is going to be fine, but it will have a headwind against rent growth because they are allocating more capital to taxes or CAM or insurance.
Ki Bin Kim: Thank you for that. Just quick question on your cash AFFO, your FFO increased, guidance increased by a couple of pennies. I'm just curious if your AFFO per share guidance, well, you don't have guidance, but if that trend is also increasing just because at least this quarter, you seem to have a little bit more CapEx than we thought?
Conor Fennerty: Thank you for that color.
Ki Bin Kim: But just curious.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Hi Ki Bin it's Connor. The short answer is yes. As I mentioned, the second quarter, effectively half the beat was related to operational issues or operational benefits, I should say, early rents, rent commencements, over rents, et cetera. So clearly those fall through to the bottom line. So the short answer is if we looked at kind of our retained cash flow forecast today versus three months ago, it would be higher. CapEx will continue to increase over the course of the year. One, there is some seasonality to that, right tenants like to get open ahead of the holidays. So you should assume it will be higher in the back half of the year. But again, coming back to my initial response, it is higher than it was three months ago because of the operational kind of good guys we've had over the course of the year.
Ki Bin Kim: Okay. Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: You're welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from Floris Van Dijkum with Compass Point, please go ahead.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a â I mean, you touched upon it a little bit earlier, David, but maybe talk about your IRR targets, how much have they increased since the beginning of the year, as borrowing costs have gone up and interest rates have gone up and obviously with inflation as well? And presumably, a lot of that would appear to be playing into your thesis for convenience, where you're slightly more protected on an inflation perspective perhaps in some other property types. But I'm curious to see if your return expectations, your IRR expectations, it also increased for that aspect of the business.
David Lukes: It's a very difficult question to answer because the last 60 days have been so volatile in terms of rates and particularly the credit markets. I think it's safe to say that our return expectations are higher. And the question is that higher going to come from higher cap rates and acquisition, or is it going to come from higher renewal rates and market rents? And it seems to be a blend of the two. I wish I could give you a more specific target answer other than to say that we are underwriting higher market rents because we're witnessing them. And we're also assuming that cap rates will move up a little bit, given the fact that our competition in the convenience sector does tend to be private levered buyers. So our hope is that we're going to get the benefit of both.
Floris Van Dijkum: And if I could follow-up, I'm fascinated by this cell phone data information. And obviously you guys have looked at this for more than a year now, but I'm curious to see whether you would be willing to share some of that with the investment community. Obviously you're sharing with your tenants. What percentage of your â if I were to ask what percentage of your centers rank in the top 10% in their local markets or their MSA? And I would imagine a center like the Downtown Miami one would rank near the top in Miami. But I'm curious to see how widespread that is in the rest of your portfolio? And how relevant is that in your view, because obviously traffic data, as you rightly alluded to for Uber Eats drivers, I mean, they pick up stuff, but they are not buying anything in your center. So, there is a lot of parsing you have to go, you know, through that data, presumably.
David Lukes: Yes, it is absolutely fascinating data. And I mean, it really is, it's been four years since we've had access to cell phone data. And I think a lot of companies are becoming very, very intrigued because now we can have similar information that the retailers have had ever since credit cards. And so it does give the landlords a lot more benefit to understand specifically trade area and customer patterns. Floris, we've been trying at NAREIT conferences and so forth to give anecdotal information. We'll do like a deep dive study on a property to show some interesting facts. It has been a little difficult to turn it into global assumptions. And part of that's because we own 99 assets out of 30,000 in the U.S. And so it's hard to kind of turn something into a global assumption. But there are some very interesting data points is that how large trade areas really are? And they are much bigger than, I think, any of us thought, even those of us that have been in the sector for a long time, what's the frequency of the customer visit? How many times a week do they come? What's changed during the pandemic in terms of trips daily versus weekend? What percentages of people that linger between stores and cross shop versus the percentage that just come in and out for one store? All those data points at this point have been hard for us to explain to investors other than anecdotes, where it's been very helpful as in leasing, because we can ask a tenant, who is your customer. And if they say my customer is a woman with two children and a college three between the ages of 30 and 42, we can tell them exactly how many of those customers came to the site on a Tuesday. So, it really has helped leasing. And I think it's made the tenants a lot more confident with signing tenure leases with rent .
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks David I appreciate it.
David Lukes: Thanks Floris.
Operator: The next question will come from Mike Miller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Miller: Yes. Hi two quick questions. First has the pace of product coming to market slowed or is it still coming? And you are just seeing more prevalent bid ask pricing spreads. And the second question is who are you typically buying the convenience assets from?
David Lukes: 
Conor Fennerty: Mike pay for a product you mean like assets coming to market?
Mike Miller: Yes. 
David Lukes: Mike, I thought you meant pace of product, meaning, lawn furniture. Okay, pace of market of assets coming to market has definitely slowed. I mean, John is sitting right here. It's definitely slowed from 60 days ago. And that's not surprising. I think sellers are looking at Cap rates from the last six months and buyers are hoping for different Cap rates for the next six months and so there is a little bit of a standoff. It's not non-existent, but with the debt markets where they are and kind of confusion over the longevity of inflation and Cap rates, I do think the amount of assets that are coming to market is a little bit smaller than it was to before.
Mike Miller: Got it. And as it relates to the convenience assets, who are the typical sellers that you're buying from?
David Lukes: They tend to be local and regional sellers, families, private.
Mike Miller: Got it. Okay. That was it. Thank you.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks Mike.
Operator: The next question will come from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, good morning. Just on the conversation with Ki Bin in terms of the reimbursements, it sounds like you are focusing on margin with the small shops and maybe trading that a little bit for â trading that off with the stability associated with anchors. Should we assume that you are also looking at the credits of the small shops more carefully to protect yourself on the downside?
Conor Fennerty: Hey, Linda, it's Conor. I would just say, I can't recall who asked the question, but we feel really good about the credit quality of what we're buying. If you look at the top tenants that we disclose for the convenience assets, it's a number of banks, financial institutions, quick service restaurants that are all public. So I would say a couple things. One, we don't think we're going out the risk curve in terms of credit quality. These are kind of the tenants we operate in our existing shopping centers, where there are grocery, power, lifestyle, whatever they might be. And the second point is we aren't focused on margin, we're just saying  thesis, the convenience thesis. So again, we're looking at kind of the bottom line that the flow through of free cash flow from NOIs David allude to on a couple responses, but it's not a focus of ours. It's just a factor that we like as part of the investment thesis.
Linda Tsai: Got it. Thanks.
David Lukes: You are welcome.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Lukes for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
David Lukes: Thank you everyone for joining our call. We'll speak to you next quarter.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
57,SITC,3,2022,2022-10-25 12:28:07,"Operator: Good day and welcome to the SITE Centers reports Third Quarter 2022 Operating Results. All participants will be in listen-only mode. . After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Monica Kukreja, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Monica Kukreja: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to SITE Centers third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes; and Chief Financial Officer, Conor Fennerty. In addition to the press release distributed this morning, we have posted our quarterly financial supplement and slide presentation on our website at www.sitecenters.com, which is intended to support our prepared remarks during today's call. Please be aware that certain of our statements today may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Additional information may be found in our earnings press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on today's call including FFO, operating FFO, and same-store net operating income. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in today's quarterly financial supplement. At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce our Chief Executive Officer, David Lukes.
David Lukes: Thank you, Monica. Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. We had another very productive quarter with results ahead of budget, significant leasing volume despite having less available space, a number of asset sales with proceeds used to continue to invest in our convenience thesis, and a balance sheet that remains in great shape with debt-to-EBITDA in the low fives, which remains well ahead of the peer group and the sector overall. Leasing demand continue to be very strong with national tenants looking to expand their footprints in the wealthiest suburban markets where we operate and existing tenants looking to lock-in their locations with renewals. This activity, along with execution from our leasing team, resulted in a 60 basis points sequential increase of our portfolio lease rate to 95%, which is consistent with our commentary and goals for the year. I'll start my comments for the quarter, shift to leasing, then move to transaction activity. As I mentioned, third quarter OFFO was ahead of budget primarily on better operations, which Conor will provide more details on later. Despite no shortage of headwinds, our tenant coordination and construction teams continue to do an amazing job working with tenants to get open ahead of schedule, which drove part of our outperformance this quarter. Moving to leasing, as noted, demand and activity remained very high in the third quarter with 1.5 million square feet leased, which is the largest amount of total square footage this company has leased in five years, despite a materially smaller footprint. In terms of new leasing, we had another quarter of over 200,000 square feet of new deals with strength from national shops as a standout. Our shop lease rate was up 180 basis points sequentially and 520 basis points from the third quarter last year. Quite a bit of this leasing was in our tactical redevelopment pipeline with deals from Cava, Starbucks, Sweetgreen, Visionworks, Dry Bar, Club Champion, and a few other first of portfolio deals expected to be signed in the coming months. The projects broken out on our tactical development pipeline that are under construction are now 84% leased with deliveries beginning this year into 2024 with immediate expected accretion. Looking forward, we have another 250,000 square feet at share in lease negotiations, which we expect to be completed over the next two quarters with activity from a mix of national publicly traded credit tenants. Based on the trending strength of small shop leasing and considering our current pipeline of unexecuted lease negotiations, we believe that the lease rate on our portfolio will continue to climb marginally through the end of the year, absent bankruptcies. That said the absolute level of activity will moderate as we simply have less space to lease. Shifting to transaction activity, we had another quarter recycling capital highlighted by the sale of the previously announced Madison Pool A portfolio for $388 million. Net proceeds were used to pay down debt and reinvest in convenience assets in Atlanta and Phoenix. We also opportunistically sold one wholly-owned property in Columbus at a cap rate in the 6% range and used the proceeds to pay down debt and to repurchase stock at a double digit FFO yield and a mid-8% implied cap rate. The largest investment this quarter was the acquisition of a four property portfolio for $23 million in Phoenix, Arizona, which is a top 10 market for the company and a market we've transacted in a number of times in the last year. The property is a 100% leased to a mix of service and quick service restaurants with 76% of the tenancy national credit and a drive-through unit at all four properties. We underwrote a five-year NOI CAGR of 3% plus with minimal CapEx, which is consistent with our existing convenience portfolio and one of the key attributes of our thesis. Moving to Atlanta, we bought another convenience asset in our largest market and remain excited about the potential for more opportunities to grow our portfolio in this key MSA given our presence on the ground. The property is located just a few miles west of Hammond Springs, which was another convenience asset we acquired in 2021. Going forward, we remain encouraged by the unique opportunities in the convenience sub-sector that are a direct result of local relationships formed over the past several years. Future acquisitions would allow us to continue to grow our portfolio of properties with strong credit and low recurring CapEx located at high traffic intersections within wealthy suburban communities. Because the cash flow growth profile and risk adjusted IRRs of this property type are elevated with rents accelerating with inflation, we will continue as we have in prior years to utilize retained cash flow and proceeds from recycling fully stabilized assets into this sub asset class when the right opportunities arise. The decision as always will be measured against other capital allocation options that we have at the time, and consistent with our goal to generate sustainable OFFO and AFFO growth. In summary, we're pleased with the -- our portfolio and the current strength of operations, our investments, which have increased our long-term growth profile and future investment prospects, which we believe will create stakeholder value while prudently managing our balance sheet. Thank you to the entire SITE Centers team for another very productive quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor.
Conor Fennerty: Thanks, David. I'll comment first on quarterly results, discuss our revised 2022 guidance and some of the moving pieces heading into the fourth quarter and 2023, and then conclude with the balance sheet. Third quarter results were ahead of plan, as David mentioned, due to a number of operational factors, including earlier rent commencements in higher occupancy and higher overage and ancillary income. These operational factors totaled about $0.01 per share relative to budget. The quarter also included $200,000 of unbudgeted straight-line rent from the conversion of cash basis tenants, and $300,000 from payments and settlements related to prior periods. In terms of operating metrics, the lease rate for the portfolio was up 60 basis points sequentially and 270 basis points year-over-year with our lease rate now at 95%, which is well above the company's pre-COVID high watermark of 94.3% back in 2017. Highlighting our leasing volume and backlog, we had over 250,000 square feet of new leases commenced in the third quarter, representing over $5 million of annualized base rent. Despite that, the SNO pipeline was effectively unchanged at $22 million as new leases were added and offset the impact of commencements. These signed leases continue to represent over 5% of annualized third quarter base rent or over 6% if you also include leases in negotiation in our pipeline. We provided an updated schedule on the expected ramp up of the pipeline on Page 6 of our earnings slides. Same-store NOI grew 1.1% in the third quarter with the uncollectable revenue line item a 160 basis point headwind to year-over-year growth. Included in uncollectable revenue this quarter were $510,000 of reserves related to unpaid revenue from Cineworld as a result of its recent bankruptcy filing. Moving on to our outlook. We are raising our 2022 OFFO guidance to a range of $1.16 to a $1.17 per share. Rent commencements, uncollectible revenue and G&A are the largest swing factors expected to impact fourth quarter results, and where we end up in the revised full-year range. We are also raising expectations for fee income to the top end of the prior range and leaving same-store NOI guidance unchanged, which we believe is prudent considering the macro environment despite third quarter outperformance versus budget. To-date outside of the Cineworld bankruptcy, we've had no unbudgeted fallout or other bad debt headwinds. Details on same-store NOI are in our press release and earning slides. For the fourth quarter of 2022, there are a few moving pieces to consider from the third quarter. First, as I previously mentioned, we had $300,000 of non-recurring uncollectible revenue and $200,000 of non-recurring straight-line rent in the third quarter. Second, the Madison assets sold in July generated almost $200,000 of NOI at share and almost $750,000 in JV fees in the third quarter, which implies total JV fees of about $1.8 million for the fourth quarter. Lastly, the third quarter included $1.3 million of lease termination income, which is about $1 million higher than our trailing two-year quarterly average. A summary of these factors is on Page 9 of our earning slides. Moving to 2023. We are not providing guidance at this time, but wanted to provide clarity on a few line items heading into the New Year. First on fees, we expect JV and RBI fees to total about $5 million with minimal contribution from RBI. This assumption reflects activity to-date along with additional expected JV asset sales. Second, we would expect G&A to be about $50 million. Third, 2022 year-to-date results include $2.8 million of non-recurring reserve reversals, and based on remaining AR on the balance sheet, we expect reversals to be relatively muted in 2023. And lastly, we have three Cineworld or Regal Cinema locations with total annualized base rent of $2.9 million as of September 30. None of the leases have been rejected to-date, but it is likely that we will recapture at least one location based on our initial conversations. The three leases are generally evenly split in terms of rent and recoveries across our total exposure. Finally, ending with our balance sheet. At quarter end, leverage was 5.3x, fixed charge remained over 4x, and our unsecured debt yield was over 20%. In the third quarter, we repaid the debt associated with the Madison Pool A portfolio as part of that sale, and swapped the $200 million term loan to a fixed rate for the remainder of the loans termed at an all-in rate of 3.8%. Pro forma for these transactions, the company has just $87 million of unsecured debt maturing through year-end 2023, $870 million of availability on a recently recast line of credit and floating rate exposure is just 6% of total debt. This leverage profile and significant capacity provides substantial liquidity and allows us to take advantage of potential future opportunities as they arise and to drive sustainable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to David.
David Lukes: Thank you, Conor. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. . Our first question comes from Craig Mailman from Citi. Please go ahead.
Craig Mailman: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. David, I just want to touch on the leasing. You seem to detail there in the pace of velocity actually did improve quarter-to-quarter kind of led by renewals. There seems to be still some confirmation in the market about the headlines you're seeing and among the retailers and the kind of the STEM fundamentals we're seeing among the landlords. And I'm just kind of curious if you could give kind of some updated color what you're seeing quarter-to-date. And also just curious how much if any, do you think demand is being pulled forward this year with a higher pace of renewals?
David Lukes: Craig, it's a little hard to hear you, so I'll try and answer that and then you can let us know if we miss any pieces of it. But the leasing activity just remains to be very strong. I think we've had a number of people speculate when that's going to slowdown some of the macro concerns about the consumer or inflation or pending recession is going to kind of put an abrupt halt to leasing. But at this point, we're just not seeing a slowdown in demand. I would say that we're seeing a slowdown in supply. I mean our properties at this point at 95% and like we -- and we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the additional square footage the center negotiations now feels like it's continue to move higher through the remainder of the year. I guess the only color I can give you on that is that it feels like in the wealthier suburban communities where we operate, there's two things that have come out of the pandemic that remain very clear in the retailers minds. One is that convenience matters. And that's either from in-store personal trips that are kind of short duration and quick trips from your local community. And the second is that the larger retailers are using their store fleet for fulfillment. And so they're trying to get as much square footage out into these wealthy suburbs as they can and there's just not that much space left. So I think part of that is prompting them to action where they see rents rising and they want to secure space in 10-year leases. And that's why most of our leasing activity is with national credit tenants and we just haven't seen that much demand and we haven't executed many leases with local small shops. It's mostly the national chains.
Craig Mailman: That makes sense. And just one quick follow-up on that. Conor went through the Cineworld impact and you had mentioned that there could be some room for lease rate going forward, absent any bankruptcies. Could you guys just give a sense of how you feel about some of the tenants in your portfolio that have kind of been in the news, whether it's the Bath & Beyond or others, and what type of reserves you may have embedded right now or how we should think about maybe for 2023 with bad debt?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Craig, it's Conor again. You're hard to hear. So let me know if I miss any pieces or response. On Cineworld, I said in my remarks, we expect to recapture one of the three and the revenue is fairly equally split between the three locations. The reserves taken in the third quarter were entirely related to the unpaid rent from the third quarter, was unpaid revenue, I should say, excuse me. We had the tenant on cash basis previously, so there is no additional AR hit or bad debt hit from that specific tenant. As for the other tenants you named and some other names that are on folks watch list. We can't speak to individual tenants. I would just tell you we feel really good about the quality of our portfolio, the level of demand we have. And we've had periods before we've had bankruptcies, and I think if you look back in the last five years at this portfolio and our track record, we've been able to successfully backfill those locations at higher rents with better tenants. So if there is a uptick in bankruptcy, obviously it's outside of our control, but we feel really good about the backfill prospects and the portfolio in general. And so comment on 2023, happy to address that as we get closer to the next year and provide guidance.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Appreciate it. And this is Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just one more. As you think about deploying capital, how have your return hurdles adjusted given the change in your cost of capital? And then how do you think about that in terms of either share buybacks or acquisitions from here?
David Lukes: Well, there certainly our return thresholds have gone up. I mean they've gone up with commensurately with the borrowing costs. I think that there's not a ton of deal flow out there, so it's hard to say where cap rates are settling ins and things have moved so fast. But we have been buying at higher cap rates this past quarter than we were two quarters ago. With respect to the allocation decision of capital as to whether we're buying assets or stock or paying down debt, it really depends on the source. And to-date, we've really been using proceeds from asset sales and we've done a little bit of everything and that is a strategy that will likely continue.
Nick Joseph: Thanks.
Craig Mailman: Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Samir Khanal from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Samir Khanal: Hey, good morning, everybody. David, you mentioned the 250,000 square feet of activity that's under negotiation. Maybe walk us through kind of any changes you're seeing in those leases versus maybe what you've both signed over the last six months. Any pushbacks you're getting from those potential retailers, whether it's higher TIs just trying to see what given all sort of the higher costs and potential slowdown out there. I mean what are the concerns that they've come -- kind of come forward in those leases in terms of negotiations?
David Lukes: Samir, if you look on Page 13 of our stuff, which has got the particularly the net effective rent category, you'll see that one of the changes over the past year is that we've kind of shifted from more box leases to more shop leases. And I think that's the trend that's going to kind of drive us through the remainder of the year because we've really leased all of our larger square footage locations. There's very few left. And so the demand right now is coming from national shops. Those leases are less of a negotiation than the larger anchor leases. And so I don't think the terms have changed very much. Certainly, the cost of building out a space has gone up in the past year. But rents have also gone up. So I think if anything, we're just starting to see the speed at which some of these retailers want to get into local shops has improved. And that's kind of the only trend I can come up with. I really haven't seen a lot of change in terms even the request for TI dollars hasn't gone up as much even though I think the spaces are a little bit more expensive.
Operator: The next question comes from Todd Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Todd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. David, just following up on the topic around capital deployment. I'm just wondering if the market for dispositions is still there to raise capital for reinvestment in new properties or buybacks. And if you could just talk a little bit more about the appetite for stock buybacks in the current environment with the share price below the level at which you repurchase shares at in September?
David Lukes: Well, on the disposition side, it is kind of interesting. You remember there's one important piece of the transactions world in this country and that's 1031. And there have been a couple of situations where a 1031 positioned buyer has called us and talked to us about other things that we might want to sell. And so I do feel like there's one-off activity with smaller or midsize properties. Even in the brokerage world, you haven't seen a lot of large portfolios marketed right now. But I do think there's still a lot of activity kind of under the covers where you're getting 1031 money that has to be redeployed quarter-to-quarter. And in certain cases that's an opportunity for us to recognize if you would say yesterday's prices with today's transaction. And even if it's just a little bit Todd, it gives us an opportunity to have some recycling. The decision as to whether we're buying assets or paying down debt or buying stock, I think has everything to do with the sourcing of those funds. And so the way we thought about last quarter notwithstanding the fact that the price at which we bought back stock was higher than today's price. But the cap rate at which we sold the asset and then repurchased stock was awfully accretive. And so I think we feel comfortable with that trade because the cost of that capital is a mark on the asset you're selling and not necessarily where the stock is trading that day.
Conor Fennerty: And Todd, the only thing I'll just add to that is, we don't need to sell assets to buy assets. We think it's prudent at this point in time. We still have $40 million to $50 million retain cash flow and other sources of liquidity. So to David's point, it -- we think it makes sense right now to match funds, but it's not a requirement given the balance sheet position we're in.
Todd Thomas: Okay. And then you did mention though I mean it seems like you're still very much focused on acquiring convenience oriented centers like you've been acquiring over the last several quarters here. I would think that that market is a little bit more fragmented in general and might lend itself well to this environment. Maybe not a lot of distress at the asset level, but do you expect to see some financial distress perhaps begin to surface, the longer this environment persists and is this an opportunity for you to be a little bit more aggressive, maybe a catalyst to -- for a joint venture arrangement or a partnership or do you think that you pause and sort of await more visibility and slowdown a bit here?
David Lukes: Well, to your first point, I certainly agree that it is a fragmented sub asset class. The dollar value of the transactions tends to be smaller. And I think we've seen that the movement in cap rates up and down happens a little bit faster simply because the dollar values are smaller. Our hope is that we're going to find even more better inventory than we've seen to-date when people's mortgages mature and the cost of refinancing is high and therefore a sale is more likely to happen. I know John sitting next to me here and he's still reviewing an awful lot of deals on a weekly basis. And so I think we can be very selective. But the pricing of those seems to have been moving in our benefit. To your second question on joint ventures, I think at this point, given our capital position, we feel pretty confident that we're finding deals that we like and we can decide at that time whether we want to buy and continue to grow. We're open-minded about joint ventures, but if you look at the reduction in JVs at this company in the last five years, the quality of our earnings is just much higher than it was five years ago. And a lot of that is because its wholly-owned assets that we've bought as opposed to legacy joint ventures where some of that income is coming from fees.
Todd Thomas: Okay. Got it. And just lastly, Conor, you gave a little bit of color on 2023, which was helpful, but any thoughts about the May 2023 maturity $87 million about 3.5%. How should we expect that to be repaid or funded or refinanced I guess?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. It's a good question, Todd. I mean thankfully we still have seven, eight months until that maturity. And to your point, thankfully, it's a stub bond. It's not a full size bond. So look, there are a number of options to-date. We just recast our line of credit. So in a worst case scenario, we've got five years of term there and we could put on the line, that's obviously not a sustainable long-term solution. But other solutions are we approach the IG market if we see a little more stability or our secured debt ratio is 2%, so we could go down the secure debt route if we need be. So there are a lot of options to your points. It's quite a bit of ways and it's a stub bond. It's not significant relative to the enterprise, but we've got a lot of options. And then the last one is just retain cash flow and paying that down over the course of the year. So TBD until we get closer to that date. The good news is we got quite a bit of time and we we'll address it as we see fit at that time.
Operator: The next question comes from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Alexander Goldfarb: Hey, good morning. So two questions. David, you mentioned upfront that you were surprised how strong leasing has been and the same breath said, hey, look, at some point expect, overall leasing volumes to just moderate given running out of space. So two parts to that, one, small shop is still sort of in the mid-80s, so it seemed like there's still plenty of runway there. But even still presumably as you run with less leasing just because you're running out of space, presumably we'll see accelerating rents or something of the sort that would sort of signify more pricing power. So I'm curious, are you suggesting that we should be bracing for slower leasing and slower rent growth? Or is it just a heads-up to us to be aware of the composition of the leasing stats and maybe focus more on rent growth rather than overall leasing volumes.
David Lukes: Good morning, Alex. Well, certainly I would focus less on overall leasing volume, total square footage of new leases and that's simply because the amount of inventory left is getting pretty skinny. I do feel like the market rents are still increasing and in certain locations, it's surprisingly high in terms of how much more rent we're getting than we had maybe two or three years ago. A lot of that is simply because the locations that someone wants particularly end caps and drive-throughs are in such high demand that those rents are escalating far more than inline space. With respect to my comment about being surprised, I think I'm only surprised because like all of us, we hear the negative news every day, skepticism about the economy, nervousness about a flow down, rising inflation, thereâs a lot of macro conversations that are scary. And sometimes sales, any sales environment, including leasing is sentiment driven and retailers can change their sentiment get nervous and pull back. It just hasn't happened. And I think part of that confidence from the retailers is when they look at high income suburbs, remember our average household income is $115,000. These high income suburbs don't have that much space thatâs available, that is convenient, that has the parking lot, it's got curb cuts, it has visibility. So the demand is there. And it feels like even if demand slows down, there's enough tenants that are all going after the same space that it just feels like we've got a little bit more room to run.
Alexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, and if you already sold it then my bad for forgetting, but I believe you guys still have a Chinese JV that David you arranged a number of years ago, just given changes, we've seen other Chinese real estate entities pull back, whether it's because of debt or political pressures from Beijing. Is there anything with your Chinese JV that could result in that potentially unwinding or some transaction occurring or that seems feels pretty safe and comfortable to you guys?
David Lukes: We haven't seen any change to-date. We were just on the phone with them for their quarterly distribution call last week. Our partner there is an awfully large institution. They're happy with the dividends and the collection rate through COVID. I think if you look worldwide at real estate, a company that can deliver a 7-plus-percent dividend through COVID is seen as a pretty secure investment. So I don't see any change in the structure of that joint venture in the near-term.
Operator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, two quick ones from me. Just staying on the JVs, you just touched on the Chinese institution investor one, but just on Madison and Prudential, just maybe any updates on the plan there. Is there a long-term thinking of doing more selling? Just how should we think about those?
David Lukes: I think it's status quo Ron right now. I think that the larger institutions are very aware of what's happening in the credit markets right now. They're heavily engaged in looking at the quarterly reports that we give them from the operations. I think like most people they're very happy with the operations, and there's a question mark around valuation. And so because of that, I think status quo is probably more likely going forward on those smaller joint ventures we have. Madison has -- has been selling assets for the past couple of years. And so I think as we mentioned in our prepared remarks that, that is likely that we continue to see some asset sales coming out of that joint venture.
Ronald Kamdem: Got it. Helpful. And then going back to the question on sort of the maturity next year. I know, Conor, you mentioned there's a lot of options. But just -- can you just remind us like where could you issue sort of longer 10-year paper today? Or just give us a sense where the market is today and so forth?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. It's a good question, Ron, and it really depends to your point on the day. I would say the range we've gotten quoted from working with our DCM desk kind of across our banks we work with has been anywhere in the last six months between 5% and 7%. And so kind of my early response, it depends on the day. So thankfully, we've got, I would say, extreme flexibility or optionality when it comes to secured debt, the IG market, the term loan market, whatever it might be. We've shown kind of proven access to all three of those markets over the last five-plus years. And so again, we're talking about a stub maturity that's $87 million relative to a $5-plus billion enterprise value. Again, we will address it as it comes due in May of next year. But when we think about kind of risk to the system or risk of the company, I put down the low end of the risk spectrum.
Operator: . Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Mueller: Yes. Hi. So I know it's not a lot of volume, but can you give us a sense as to what the cap rates were on the third quarter acquisitions? And then second question, the commenced rate on same-store is about 91.5%. If we look at your signed but not open schedule, where would that take your commenced level, do you think by the end of 2023?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Mike, it's Conor. I think last quarter, we talked about the blended cap rate on acquisitions over the course of the year was, I think, just under 5.5%. And I think it's fair to assume with the third quarter acquisitions, it's modestly higher than that. I mean it's a small only $31 million and the $336 million we bought to-date. To David's point, though, we are seeing some upward movement there. So I think it's fair to assume our going in cap rate if we were to buy something going forward, it would be higher than that and obviously more conducive to our cost of capital more in line with our cost of capital to kind of Craig and Nick's question. And I missed the second question. I think it's related to 2023. So I'll think of a dodge, but I can't recall the second part of the question was.
Mike Mueller: I was looking at your commenced rate of 91.5% and if we follow that signed but not open schedule, where would that put your economic occupancy by 2023?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. If you look on Page 6 of our slides, Mike, we've got the commencement schedule for the SNO pipeline by year. We obviously will break that out by quarter in February as we provide more disclosure on the ramp of 2023. The hard part is the SNO pipeline is in dollars and your question around the lease rate and the commenced rate is in square footage. So it's a little bit of a mismatch. But I would point you to Page 6 and think of that as your guide over the course of 2023 and 2024 and the SNO commencement deliveries.
Mike Mueller: Got it. And then maybe going back real quick to the cap rate question again. If we -- if you think about, I know volumes are lower and you just are not seeing all the data points, but if you think of -- on your comment where you're seeing higher -- you have been seeing higher cap rates, would you say that the cap rates have been moving up kind of in lockstep with what you've seen rates move up? Or do you think cap rates have moved up less than what you've been noticing on the rate side?
David Lukes: Mike, I'll answer that but warn you that we're talking about a pretty small volume of transactions.
Mike Mueller: Sure.
David Lukes: Maybe of $10 million, $20 million; $30 million is not going to really be a great indicator. But I think it's fairly easy to answer that rates have moved up much faster than cap rates have. And I don't think that's going to surprise anybody because the rates have moved up the fastest in 40 years. So I think it just takes a little while for cap rates to reset. The thing to remember is when we're buying convenience assets, about a third of the rent roll matures with no options in the next five years. So even though the cap rates are moving up marginally, the market rents are also moving up faster than anticipated. So I think the unlevered IRRs are the ones that are growing a little bit faster than going in cap rate.
Operator: The next question comes from Floris Van Dijkum from Compass Point. Please go ahead.
Floris Van Dijkum: Hey guys, good morning. Wanted to get your comments on what you think -- talk a little bit about the Kroger/Albertsons merger transaction, what that could mean in terms of the impact to the shopping center sector and for the listed sector as well?
David Lukes: Good morning, Floris. I will suddenly dodge that a little bit. It feels to us like many times when there's retailer mergers and you end up getting in a study of overlap. We've only got one property that I think even has an overlap with multiple brands. So I think our data points are pretty small on deciding what that means to the overall sector. But I could kind of sum it up by saying that any time there's a merger of two large entities like that, you do have to wonder whether store closings are a part of that or the outcome. And I think it remains to be seen.
Floris Van Dijkum: Yes. No, and clearly, you're less impacted than some of your peers. I just -- I was curious to get your take on what you thought this could mean for the grocery sector and frankly, for tenant exposures as well.
David Lukes: I will learn with you over time. We'll see.
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Floris, I would say, from our perspective, we're excited that the majority of our exposure is to Kroger. I mean, they've obviously done a great job investing in their stores in the last couple of years or the last couple of decades, excuse me. So to David's point, we think the impact to us is fairly insignificant. And again, to David's point, if the overlap and you're thinking about overlapping stores, we feel better about owning the stores that have been recently invested in than the ones that haven't.
Floris Van Dijkum: Great. And maybe just a couple of other minor points here, but I noticed your operating margin actually dropped marginally even though your occupancy was higher. Is that simply an impact of the high -- the rise in operating expenses and not being able to call that back in your recoveries? And where do you see -- and how has that changed how you think about negotiating new leases with your tenants?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Floris, it's Conor. It's a great question, and I had the exact same question when I saw the first draft of our operating metrics for the quarter, it related to some non-recoverable expenses that I would call, the majority of which were one-time in nature related to some ancillary income that's just a mismatch between the income and the expense. So I would expect that kind of operating margin to continue to trend higher as it has in the last two years especially when you think about commencements and obviously, tenants paying recoveries as their leases commence. So I think the majority of that was kind of a third quarter blip and would point you towards kind of the longer-term last couple of years and trailing 12-month metrics as a better kind of indicator of where we're going from a margin and a recovery percentage perspective.
Floris Van Dijkum: Thanks, Conor. Well I guess last question maybe on Perimeter Pointe, you -- I know you sold a portion of that, I think, for $35 million. Your redevelopment pipeline only has, I think, a $1.3 million project on the books. Presumably, the redevelopment of the remainder of that asset which cash could be quite attractive. It's in a very good location. It's going to be larger. Can you guys give us any more color on the latest thinking and developments there?
David Lukes: Perimeter Pointe, it's been an asset that we have kept liquid for the last couple of years, Floris. We've had a couple of tenants move out. We've not renewed several tenants, and we've tried to get the site in a liquid state, but we have not sold any of that piece of land. I think in our opinion, that's a piece of property that is likely to be split up and sold to mixed-use developers, but we have not consummated any transaction there.
Operator: . Our next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, good morning. What's your overall expectation for CapEx for next year? I know for a while, you're expecting elevated CapEx, but now your occupancy is getting pretty full, but then we're also in an inflationary environment. So any kind of general thoughts for CapEx in 2023?
Conor Fennerty: Hey Linda, it's Conor. It's a good question. Look, I mean, leasing volume remains elevated, and there's a lag, obviously, between when we sign a lease and when we spend the money. And generally, it's usually fair to assume half the cash is spent before the commencement and half post commencement. So I would expect CapEx to remain kind of elevated versus certainly in 2019 and 2020, 2020 in particular, given the lack of leasing that occurred then. But we'll provide more disclosure on that with 2023 earnings or excuse me, guidance. The only thing I would say is even this year with our heavy spending, we had, call it, $40 million plus of free cash flow. Just given our payout ratio, even if CapEx is pending next year, which I think it's fair to assume, I think it's also fair to assume that we have a decent amount of retained cash flow just given the payout ratio today. So TBD will provide more color on that with February results, but I would expect it to remain elevated just given the amount of activity we have going.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then just on bad debt, you highlighted Regal in the presentation, is there any kind of general thoughts on bad debt levels for 2023?
Conor Fennerty: Yes. Yes, it's a good question. Look, I don't think it's going to be a source of income like it was or has been for the year. Well, like I said, well some of the CapEx question, we'll provide more guidance. But I certainly don't think it will be a source of income given the amount of AR we have left on the balance sheet and just the amount of kind of the macro headwinds we're seeing. But TBD on what that number looks like.
Operator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Lukes for any closing remarks.
David Lukes: Thank you for joining our call and we will talk to you next quarter.
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
